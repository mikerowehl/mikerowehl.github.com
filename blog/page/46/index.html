  <div class="entry-content"><p>Engadget had a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7673568580289881/">post about a novel delivered to cell phones in 1,600 word installments</a>, which sounded interesting but I held off posting about it for a while. The concept does have some initial &#8220;neat&#8221; factor to it, but I wanted to mull it over for a little while. This post is really about communication methods changing and shaping the content of communication, and not just about this novel delivered to cell phones. The novel does display a lot of factors I want to talk about however. Most important, that the structure of the novel was based in part on the delivery method. Not just that it was broken up, but that the author chose a writing style that was more concise and action oriented. But that got me thinking about how often communication is not targeted to the methods being used. In particular, the use of hyperlinks in web pages. The use of links we see today is almost nothing like the way they were intended to work. If you want to see the way they were intended to work, take a look at online documentation about programming languages. Just about <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/imageio/stream/ImageInputStream.html">anything from the Java docs at Sun should do</a>. Links have mostly turned into menu items, leading to other areas you can go to and not necessarily threading together thoughts or concepts.</p>

<p>One area where this is reversing somewhat is within the blogging community. The links that people put in their blogs do point to related topics, and they do point to writings by others on like issues. But they remain relatively isolated nodes. Most entries only have one link to the story being commented on, and then perhaps trackback links for others who have responded. I have a vision of linking in which the links from a number of terms on the same page lead off to related thoughts or further information. Probably because I still remember the initial description of hypertext I heard when <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/lee.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a> gave instantiation to the mostly theoretical concept. I can&#8217;t find the page right now, but I once saw someone&#8217;s writing who made excellent use of hyperlinks and bolding within the document. If I ever find it again it might serve as my shining example of proper use of a medium. The bolding and the hyperlinks together served as perfect markers for speed reading. There is a Style Guide for Hypertext, and it does have <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html">a section on the use of links</a>, but it&#8217;s a very cursory treatment. I have no idea what effect it really would have on a large scale, but just imagine if most major news stories were really marked up with background info. Currently almost everything on the major news sites has no real markup in the stories. Maybe a company name or two, or very simple definitions - but even that is uncommon.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve started reading <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=174">Interface Culture</a> I know I&#8217;ve been paying a lot more attention to my use of links in my entries. Is that a good or a bad thing? I&#8217;m not quite sure yet, but I should know in a few weeks. I suspect that it will change the way that I think about the information I put up. Much the way that the act of blogging has changed the way that I process the information that I run across. Now that I pull little tidbits of news out of the flow of information and write my own entries about them I am a lot more introspective. I actually feel more in touch with both the things I&#8217;m doing and the things I read about. The vast galaxy of information has started to resolve into a couple of relatively distinct constellations. And I have something of an idea about how I think my projects relate to what others are working on. Sure, last year I could have regurgitated a list of a dozen people working on like projects. I had all the information. The difference is that this year I can answer questions like &#8220;how does that really relate to what you&#8217;re doing&#8221; and &#8220;why do you think they&#8217;ve chosen to do things that way&#8221;. However, it also means that there are some issues I don&#8217;t know about which last year I might have. I can only assume that this is a good thing. I must have been operating beyond my true capacity to process before. I was gathering and storing, but not processing.</p>

<p>How does that relate to our rather half-assed use of hypertext? Does the lack of craft put into transferring content online mean that everyone is trying to work beyond their real capacity? Or does everyone just think that hypertext is useful only within a relatively limited set of applications? And that it&#8217;s serving as best it can within online publishing and doesn&#8217;t need to be pushed further? I don&#8217;t think I buy that. I think the information that goes online does need to be marked up more. And it might not just mean inserting some hyperlinks either. The people working on making the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> a reality probably really are onto something. Maybe the reason it looks so far off is because the web is so heavily populated by information which is ill suited to the medium. Does that mean that the semantic web demands too much? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>This post has no real conclusion by the way. I don&#8217;t really know what I think about the issues as a whole. Some recent thoughts about online collaboration and the mixed forms of documents and content have gotten me thinking about the nature of communication in general. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what those thoughts are, but I think most of The Internet has really been under-realized. Probably because smaller and more obvious goals were in place at the time. A lot more can be done to facilitate communication and collaboration online.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Mar-12.html">post in Miguel&#8217;s blog</a> mentions a system called Gnome Notifier, which provides a way for applications to use area in the panel to get the users attention rather than using popups. I thought that <a href="http://www.xchat.org/">XChat</a> used to have a panel component that would tell you what tabs had activity, so that you could switch to another desktop and know when to switch back (without having to turn sound on&#8230; ugh, I hate notification sounds). But I can&#8217;t find the options on my <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> system, so maybe I just imagined that. I would love to see notifications go to the panel instead of popups.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;m sure most of you already know, I have a package for Palm handhelds called <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> that allows posting directly from a Palm handheld to all sorts of blogging services. I finally released the 1.9 version today. I was on the road for the last month pretty much, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to make any of the updates I should have. This release fixes the default <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> hostname, and adds TypePad, B2, and LiveJournal to the list of supported services. I had to reduce the number of unregistered posts to 5 however. Sorry to be a dick, but there was just too much moochin of my l33t0 warez going on. I&#8217;ll make up for it by hacking some <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">Open Palm Environment</a> tools this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gadgetopia <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/03/11/ComputerLanguagesHistory.html">posted</a> about a <a href="http://www.levenez.com/lang/history.html">timeline of computer languges</a>. The chart is actually part of a <a href="http://www.levenez.com/lang/">Computer Languages History page</a>, which has links to all sorts of great info. Taking a look at the chart itself it seems like there isn&#8217;t as much cross-pollination of languages as there used to be. I could be wrong, and I&#8217;m just overlooking some aspects of the chart. But it seems like many of the popular scripting languages (Perl, Ruby, Python) pulled from lots of original sources and have shot out up to the present, and there are others like C, OCAML, and Scheme that have just been around forever. Is this indicative of stagnation? Or has a nice natural organization been found, and the initial turbulent years where the aberration? The way it looks now, at the expense of overgeneralization, is that there are  amalgam languages that have pulled influence from many different sources in order to allow flexability, and there are some languages that stick to a single style. There are exceptions of course, independent languages which allow for programming in many different styles. But have we discovered all the basic programming paradigms (functionaly, imperative, message passing, etc.)? There is still a lot of progress that needs to be made in the software engineering field, we obviously aren&#8217;t at the end of the process as a whole. But the progress can come either from lower level discoveries (such as a new basic paradigm for code organzation) or it can come from higher level software engineering practices (use case modeling, CASE, extreme programming, etc.). I&#8217;m not convinced that there aren&#8217;t more fundamental changes coming down the line. If people were working on them, I would expect to see more languages instability. Maybe it&#8217;s just lost in the noise now because there are so many languges out there, and either the next advance hasn&#8217;t happened yet or it hasn&#8217;t reached mainstream usage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been a bunch of updates to the <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl.cfm">WINKsite blog</a> lately. Dave Harper, one of the driving forces behind <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> (which is just one instantiation of the general <a href="http://www.wirelessink.com/">Wireless Ink</a> technology), has been laying out some interesting topics. Even though it&#8217;s one of the older updates, I highly recommend <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?blog_id=929">the post about <em>Mobilizing The Masses With &#8220;Location Aware&#8221; Applications</em></a>. I&#8217;ve added the blog feed to my newsreader, hoping that we&#8217;ll see more great tidbits from the east coast crew. Another interesting bit of info, I just realized that one of Dave&#8217;s WINK sites has help forums and the WINK blog feed. Check out <a href="http://winksite.com/dharper/help">http://winksite.com/dharper/help</a> (WINKsite # 1562).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=174">currently reading Interface Culture</a>, and some of the stories about the early adoption of hypertext remind me a lot of what seems to be going on with mobile content. We&#8217;re still in a very investigatory phase with relation to mobile services and publishing. Some of us see a lot of potential, but aren&#8217;t quite able to make the full jump all the way to what our vision of mobile services should be. Others don&#8217;t really see the value in the medium yet so they&#8217;re holding back. And I think just like what happened with the web, eventually everyone will end up using mobile services. But once we&#8217;re there the believers will be saying &#8220;see, I told you mobile services were going to have a major impact&#8221;, while the skeptics will be saying &#8220;see, I told you that mobile services weren&#8217;t going to work the way they were originally brought out&#8221;. And both groups are going to be correct to a point. The end result of a stream of innovation such as is happening within wireless and mobile communications almost never ends up looking like what the original conception was. That&#8217;s part of the definition of a successfull technology. It gets adopted and adapted and extended by the people who first see the strong applications for it. Those applications are not normally technology driven, so the &#8220;cool&#8221; stuff that us technologists see coming down the line may or may not have anything to do with the user applications that first drive adoption. The best thing we can do is make something (anything) available to users and then see what they do with it. Release the technology and see what the people come up with. People ask me why I use WINKsite as an example all the time. Well, this is it. They&#8217;ve got a technology that they think is going to be big at some point, so they put up a public site to let people experiment with it and learn about how it could be used. I consider that a perfect example of proper planning for innovation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/03/11/mono.html">report by Edd Dumbill about the Mono project developer meeting</a>, and it includes some good information about the long term goals of the project. I downloaded and fooled around with GNOME long before it was part of any distribution, and did some hacking for the Palm Pilot interface. But for a few years my involvment has been limited to running the packaged system made available by RedHat. Lately I&#8217;ve started to get more involved in general user applications, and my interest in the projects have started to pick back up. In particular I was looking at <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">Straw</a>, a news aggregator for GNOME, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/guile-gnome.html">using Scheme to develop visual applications</a>. Last time I fooled around with it, getting GNOME to just compile was a bitch, and playing with bleeding edge applications burnt a lot of time. This time around I&#8217;m hoping that running the latest stable release will be enough that I can experiment with the apps I want. It seems like the developer facing parts of Mono are getting a lot of attention, so maybe it really is the right time to jump back in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been wandering around through various IRC channels on <a href="http://www.freenode.net">freenode.net</a>, and while idling in the #scheme channel I saw a message from the lisppaste bot. I had never seen it before, but it&#8217;s a bot that allows for pasting content to a permenant location and sending a notification to the channel the paste is for. Given the way the bot is setup, it looks like the usage pattern is something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>during a discussion someone hacks together an example solution</p></li>
<li><p>directly from their editor/IDE they can send the example to the lisppaste bot, the code is then accessible using HTTP</p></li>
<li><p>the lisppaste bot informs the channel of the location of the pasted code</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I think that makes for a pretty cool blending of web based and chat based collaboration.</p>

<p>Another tool that&#8217;s new to me is the <a href="http://meme.b9.com/start">meme log</a>. This uses channel logs to thread together conversations and present marked-up forms of the log that make it easier to follow conversations. Apparently the lisppaste bot has a hookup that allows it to link pasted code to the conversation which generated it. I haven&#8217;t had enough time to fool around with them and see how well they work in practice, but these are some great ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4546">article over at O&#8217;Reilly</a> describes the <a href="http://www.gumstix.org">Gumstix computer</a>, a very small ARM based Linux machine. The systems themselves seem to be quite cheap compared to other embedded system development systems. Information on the sites seems to be a bit spotty with relation to how development tools are made available. Maybe it uses a completely stock gcc ARM compiler and instructions for building the cross compiler come with the board, I didn&#8217;t see that question answered directly in the <a href="http://www.gumstix.com/support.html">FAQ</a>. It is not an open source design, they aren&#8217;t planning to release schematics for the Gumstix systems. But like the author of the O&#8217;Reilly article I think the geolocation applications of a system like this are pretty interesting. Given that it runs on such low power in general, if that power supply can be made to last for a long time it would make a great geologging platform.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time lately wandering around through various blogs and maintaining my own, but during the last two weeks I&#8217;ve had more time to think about what I&#8217;ve been doing rather than just continuing to do it. Something that really struck me was how many popular bloggers made new years resolutions to not blog so much during 2004. It seemed like the practice of blogging was maybe dying out, having been realized to be a fad by some of the pioneers and picked up as a trade by others. The very nature of writing and reading weblogs seemed to be transforming, and no one really seemed to be sure where it was going. I have no idea what blogging as a whole is going to look like 6 months from now, but I do have some pretty strong opinions on the value that&#8217;s been added to web content through the addition of weblog style content.</p>

<p>The one I want to talk about right now is divergent thinking. Divergent thinking is the ability to &#8220;think outside of the box&#8221;. It&#8217;s the ability to generate a completely novel idea when faced with a problem, whether the problem is new or one that has been addressed dozens of times before. The opposite end of this is convergent thinking, which is the ability to work within the constraints of a given set of predetermined boundaries in order to adapt a solution to a problem. Both are important in general, especially when considering a company placed within a market economy. Both convergent and divergent aspects must be present for the company to survive long term. Convergent thinking is pretty common within the engineering community, it&#8217;s the standard mode of operation for someone working to fulfill an existing design or specification. Divergent thinking is something that seems to be a bit harder to integrate into the business process. Some organizations, such as Xerox PARC and Lucent Technologies, sought in large part to attempt to encourage divergent thinking. I have no idea how successful these attempts were. Depending who I talk to I get radically different views on the benefit of these organizations to their respective parent companies. That&#8217;s not really important for this discussion however. What I want to stress is that some companies went so far as to setup large labs of highly funded scientists in order to try to tap into some degree of divergent thinking.</p>

<p>I think the associations between blogs can serve as the same kind of divergent thinking pool. Taking a look back over the topics I&#8217;ve read about, and the new associations I&#8217;ve formed and ideologies I&#8217;ve run into, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever hit quite so much new material since the first year I spent at college. It&#8217;s not like I didn&#8217;t read online articles and crawl web pages before, it&#8217;s just that the format of weblogs and their use make it much easier to thread together new thoughts and find different points of view. When I&#8217;m reading about a topic in someones weblog and I find that they have a really interesting take on a technology, I can trawl through the rest of their entries and usually find out how they apply that idea to other areas. Maybe it&#8217;s just because weblogs tend to be very highly editorial and concentrate much less on establishing &#8220;only the facts&#8221;, but I&#8217;ve rarely been able to do the same thing with other forms of online publications. As a result I feel like I&#8217;ve benefited from reading weblog entries much more often than I have from reading articles in standard publications. Even in the cases where I haven&#8217;t ever corresponded with the author of the weblog directly, I feel I&#8217;ve benefited from their unique perspective.</p>

<p>I think this is what the &#8220;thinktanks&#8221; like PARC and Lucent were aiming for. The goal was to get lots of smart people together and let them exchange ideas in the hopes that something new would arise. The conventions that most people use in writing their blogs have allowed this to happen in a much broader sense however. And the personal weblog is what changed it. Most of the interactions from weblogs could be done using usenet, or forum sites, or email lists. The part that&#8217;s really different is that when I see someone say something I like, I can easily find out what they&#8217;re saying about other issues. With usenet or mailing lists, unless I know what other lists and groups this person is part of, it&#8217;s not nearly as easy to find all the output by a single person. People also seem to be much more outspoken on their personal blog. There are people who would spend most of their time in a discussion list or forum group mostly responding to existing threads without generating new topics, but who will spout off in their blog about just about anything that pops to mind. Maybe it&#8217;s cause they&#8217;re shy and they don&#8217;t feel comfortable introducing new topics to a group, I&#8217;m not quite sure. But when the space they&#8217;re writing in is their own blog, they&#8217;re much more free with their topics. When we&#8217;re talking about divergent thinking, that&#8217;s exactly the behavior that&#8217;s most valuable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/000718.html">post at Lemonodor</a> a while ago pointing to the <a href="http://www.psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/cover.html">online version of a book called <em>Successful Lisp</em></a> which is supposed to come out as a real world book some time soon. The post pointed to content at <a href="http://lispmeister.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/">Lispmeister.com</a>, which looks like another great resource for those looking to learn about Lisp.</p>
