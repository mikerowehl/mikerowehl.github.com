  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an excellent bit of commentary about innovation and the end to end design principle of interconnected networks in the audio from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail349.html">Larry Lessig at the SDForum Distinguished Speaker series</a>. Here&#8217;s a quote that really stuck out for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>We want a simple network and smart applications that run this network. The consequence of this design, which was selected solely because it allowed innovation without coordination among the network owners. The consequence of this design is to produce something like a neutral network. A network that can not know and therefor can not discriminate among applications that are placed on this network. So long as the applications going through the transport layer obey the standard protocols that the internet and physical layer need to facilitate communication it will run on this network. And you need no permission of the network owner. So this architecture guarantees that outsiders always have the right to innovate in this particular space. They have the right to innovate equally. Innovate equally here means that they have the right to innovate in something held in common. The right to innovate is held in common, and it&#8217;s that we should think of as the innovation common. Innovation common here is the right that people hold equally in the context of an end to end network to build applications and services for that network. That right is guaranteed by an architectural design and it inspires because of it&#8217;s egalitarian character an extraordinary range of innovation which otherwise would not occur.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what the mobile network providers aren&#8217;t doing. I&#8217;ve made comments about this kind of thing before (<a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=239">Separating Infrastructure</a>, <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=275">Mobile Data Services and Innovation</a>, and <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=385">Reopening Mobile and Open</a>). This kind of issue is the reason why people cite 802.11 and meshes of local area networking technologies as competitive with cellular. It has NOTHING to do with technology. Stop making technology arguments against it. So what if it&#8217;s not available everywhere, and it can&#8217;t do handoff, and it doesn&#8217;t tie into the voice network. That does not matter for the core argument. Because the unlicensed technologies are nondiscriminatory and interconnected with the Internet (big I), applications and services which address those shortcomings can be developed by anyone. Just like any disruptive innovation, the <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/040101/disruption.html">disruptive technology almost always takes root in a very undemanding application</a>. Wireless LAN technologies will be disruptive to cellular unless the cellular providers take steps to make their network innovation friendly. There might be a short term win for cellular providers in having the integrated stack. But once the technology is mature enough the game changes. The temporary win of the integrated play is just that of an immature industry. Here, this is from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail135.html">Clayton Christensen in Capturing the Upside</a> (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/transcripts/135/transcript-print135-1.html">transcript</a>) which describes a rough parallel from the PC industry:</p>

<blockquote><p>So here the rough stages of value added in the computer industry, and during the first two decades, it was essentially dominated by vertically integrated companies because they had to be integrated given the way you had to compete at the time.  We could actually insert right in here “Apple Computer.”  (Let me go back to the prior slide.)  Do you remember in the early years of the PC industry Apple with its proprietary architecture?  Those Macs were so much better than the IBM’s.  They were so much more convenient to use, they rarely crashed, and the IBM’s were kludgy machines that crashed a lot, because in a sense, that open architecture was prematurely modular.</p></blockquote>

<p>But then as the functionality got more than good enough, then there was scope, and you could back off of the frontier of what was technologically possible, and the PC industry flipped to a modular architecture.  And the vendor of the proprietary system, Apple continues probably to make the neatest computers in the world, but they become a niche player because as the industry disintegrates like this, it’s kind of like you ran the whole industry through a baloney slicer, and it became dominated by a horizontally stratified population of independent companies who could work together at arm’s length interfacing by industry standards.</p>

<p>The integration of the mobile industry is essential at this point because the services mostly suck. They&#8217;re not good enough yet, and even the best of services leave the average user confounded and the expert user livid. But once the services are able to fulfill a level of capability that surpasses the average users basic needs, the value shifts out of the basic infrastructure. If the next generation of networks is approaching as rapidly as the folks at CTIA would have us believe, that day should be coming soon. It&#8217;s a tipping point too, once the infrastructure fulfills base requirements users come flooding in and stepping up the demand for associated services. Services at this scope can&#8217;t be delivered in a walled garden. This can&#8217;t be a top down, the industry needs to be allowed to disintegrate to provide the ability to fulfill on the services that the infrastructure enables.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The announcement for the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/02/march-mobile-monday.html">March Mobile Monday is up</a>. The topic this time is Mobile Gaming, inspired in large part by the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com">Game Developers Conference</a> being in town at the same time. We&#8217;re going to be over at <a href="http://www.dimension7.com">Dimension7</a> again, cause that&#8217;s right down Folsom from Moscone and should be convenient for all the conference goers.  Here&#8217;s the essential info:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What: March Mobile Monday (Mobile Gaming)</p></li>
<li><p>When: March 7th, 2005 7:00pm</p></li>
<li><p>Where: Dimension7 (150 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA)</p></li>
<li><p>Who: Anyone interested in mobility</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: Nothing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The Mobile Monday events have been going really well, and I expect this one to keep up the trend of steady significant growth. Given that the montly events are going so well, we&#8217;ve been thinking about doing something on a grander scale. Something more like a conference than an evening event. Say a day long conference with multiple speakers, where we can give a speaking spot to some of the people we can&#8217;t fit into these smaller events as well as get prepared for the larger audience some of the more well known personalities are sure to draw. We&#8217;re just getting together some early stage plans now, but as always we&#8217;re looking for whatever help we can find. Just like the evening events, I would like the whole conf to be free to attendees. That could be hard to setup, but if <a href="http://www.bloggercon.com/">BloggerCon</a> can do it I think we can as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a few minutes ago <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/">Fagan</a> popped up on IM and said &#8220;http://geourl.org/ back up.&#8221;  Woohoo!!!! Music to my ears.  <a href="http://www.geourl.com">GeoURL</a> is a service that keeps track of physical locations to go along with web resources. So thanks to GeoURL you can see <a href="http://geourl.org/near?p=http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">web resources near me in the real world</a>. Apparently <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2005/02/25/001178.html">Ask Bjoern Hansen is responsible for the resurrection</a>. Thanks Ask! Of course, being the mobility wonk that I am, I would love a neighbors lookup function based on coordinates rather than existing resources. Tie something like <a href="http://www.tagsurf.com">TagSurf</a> (which allows tagging based on URLs) into the GeoURL lookup. Pull your GPS coords, find URLs of nearby sources, use URLs to pull comments out of Tagsurf. All we need is a layer of FOAF filtering on those results and we&#8217;ve got a decent componentized recommendation system. And I think everyone knows how much Mike hates the silo. Multiple services, acting together, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

<p>Update: I parsed Ask Bjoern Hansen as Ask &#8220;Bjoern Hansen&#8221;, and that&#8217;s not what it is at all. It&#8217;s Ask Bjoern Hansen all as one, his first name is Ask.  Ooops, sorry Ask! Thanks for the correction Fagan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris pointed me to an interview today, and I downloaded the MP3 and tossed it onto my Shuffle almost without thinking about it. Why was I able to do this action naturally and in the manner I choose?  Without switching off my main desktop machine?  Because the 0.98rc1 release of <a href="http://www.blinkenlights.ch/cgi-bin/fm.pl?get=ipode">GNUpod</a> includes the necessary changes to support the iPod Shuffle. It was crippled for a while, and I had to use this attrocious bag of drivers misnamed an operating system in order to do so. But now I can download audio when I want and put them on my device using the programs I choose to. Yay! Thank you GNUpod authors, you rock!</p>

The <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=419">last meeting was fantastic</a>, definitely check it out if you get a chance.  They need to make sure they capacity plan correctly, so if you&#8217;re planning to come email jpark at commerce.net.  I&#8217;m not putting the location in here so that people don&#8217;t just show up, like they do with the <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/">Future Salon</a> events.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had this post sitting around for a while, but seeing as Elle has declared this <a href="http://ellementk.com/archives/2005/02/19/297">Blogger Fort Weekend</a> I&#8217;ve decided to get it out now.</p>

<p>The post that kicked it off was <a href="http://www.primidi.com/2005/02/02.html">Sensors Everywhere</a> from  Roland Piquepaille&#8217;s Technology Trends. The post calls out some example solutions from an <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57702816">Information Week article of the same name</a>. I&#8217;m pretty interested in the topic of sensor networks, cause I think  that&#8217;s one of the eventual forms of mobile computing. One theory is that instead of carrying around mobile information devices with us, those mobile information access devices will diffuse into the world around us. For an example already in process, think about services like <a href="http://www.onstar.com/">OnStar</a>, which is an example of mobile information service fusing with a car. Even if that isn&#8217;t the way that things go, it&#8217;s an interesting thought experiment to think about what the world would look like if any object in the physical world could have access to information about both the user and it&#8217;s own surroundings.</p>

<p>Currently that&#8217;s just a thought experiment however. Sensor networks really only work for very predictable deployments. They allow sensors and processing to go places they previously couldn&#8217;t go before. However, they certainly don&#8217;t allow it to go everywhere. We&#8217;re a long way from the vision of <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/mobiletopics/mobile/story/0,10801,79572,00.html">smart dust</a> that can be scattered over an area at will to provide data collection and processing functions. Part of the problem is getting the electronics down to the required size, another is the power problem, and then there&#8217;s the networking problem. The networking problem is one of the places that I think we can pull the most from another technique - <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003068.html">biomimetism</a>. Both mesh networking and distributed processing are problems that are difficult to solve at best. They&#8217;re hard to conceptualize, implement, test, and debug. And even the best systems tend not to be as robust as we would like them to be.</p>

<p>I went to hear Feng Zhao speak at Stanford last year, and corresponded with him a bit. I was very interested in using <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/papers/03/TinyGALS/">TinyGALS</a> for a prototype system that never ended up making it out of concept phase. That&#8217;s a great project they have there, looking at trying to program the network instead of programming individual nodes. But it is still the traditional programming, just aimed at a different level of abstraction. There are projects looking at how to pull useful models from living systems in order to make software and embedded systems better. Even when they do find techniques that can be reused, it&#8217;s hard to merge what they find into traditional software practices. Although the front might be advancing in terms of biomimetic software, there needs to be biomimetic process and operations to go along with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Feedster was awarded <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/archives/2005/02/feedster_awarde_1.html">Best Overall Presentation at the Bay Area Interactive Group (BIG) Technology Shootout</a> last night. The main message presented was the future of XML based formats such as RSS and how they lead to a model that can best be summarized as &#8220;Search, Subscribe, Advertise.&#8221; Search is of course a very broad topic, and subscribe very general. The first thing that pops to mind is of course searching for <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=linux&amp;sort=date">all posts related to Linux</a>, and having a <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?q=linux&amp;sort=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=&amp;content=full&amp;type=rss&amp;feedsterkey=2iWbnYvPbde6QlTY7qhFZq&amp;limit=15">feed for new posts that appear on that topic</a>. But RSS search is the kind of thing that can be applied in layers, almost like a recursive operation. For instance we can provide a <a href="http://feedfinder.feedster.com/search.php?db=feeds&amp;sort=relevance&amp;q=linux">search for FEEDS related to Linux</a>, and a <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?q=linux&amp;sort=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=&amp;content=full&amp;type=rss&amp;feedsterkey=2iWbnYvPbde6QlTY7qhFZq&amp;limit=15&amp;db=feeds">feed of new feeds that appear</a>. No matter how it&#8217;s applied though, the general model of &#8220;Search, Subscribe, Advertise&#8221; best describes how to slot into the desired user behavior. Great job Chris!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there was massive feedback from putting up <a href="http://www.thecoolkids.us/coffee/index.php">The Year of Coffee</a> as the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/fotd.php">Feed of the Day</a>, people really liked it. Happy I could help out! So tonight was my turn to pick the feed again. I&#8217;m a geek at heart. Serious geek. My natural inclination is to put up something about programming languages and getting them to <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">all kinds of strange and spooky things</a>. But that&#8217;s just not interesting stuff for most people. So instead I took a random walk for a while and happened across this gem: <a href="http://www.bicyclemark.org/blog.html">Bicyclemark&#8217;s Communique</a>. Check this out:</p>

<blockquote><p>The exaggerations of a Portuguese-American, radical, activist-journalist, pretend-academic, university employee, podcaster, blog fanatic, living in Amsterdam.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay, I admit it, my curiosity was piqued. I have no idea what to expect, I was a bit off balance. Well done. The post themselves are very amusing. Then I&#8217;m almost at the end of the page and I see this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you feel my blog has been stale this week? I do. It&#8217;s always a matter of opinion of course, sometimes I write shit I hate, and the people say &#8220;hooray.&#8221; Other times I write shit I think is fun, and people say nothin. The other thing is that my podcasting has taken center stage in my mind, and blogging has become like the middle child&#8230; the jan brady.. of my internet activities. Not sure who the Cindy would be.</p></blockquote>

<p>DING DING DING! We have a winner. Podcasting, blogging, the Brady Bunch. All jumbled on top of each other. And not only did I not feel dirty, I laughed. And then a few minutes later I furrowed my brow and though &#8220;Hey&#8230;. I hope I&#8217;m not the Cindy. Or maybe that&#8217;s a good thing?&#8221; Thank you Bicyclemark. Great blog, interesting podcasts. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t have time to post about it when I put it up, but I want to talk about the last Feed of the Day I put up: <a href="http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/index.php">The Year of Coffee</a>. I ran across it cause I have a subscription to a <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=feedster&amp;sort=date">vanity feed for Feedster</a> so that I can see when anyone is talking about us. Fantastic idea, I recommend it for anyone, it&#8217;s amazing the stuff you&#8217;ll find. At first when I looked at it I thought &#8220;hey, is this a stealth blog for <a href="http://www.peets.com">Peet&#8217;s</a>?&#8221; (notice that when I think to myself I insert hyperlinks, sometimes that makes my head hurt). If that&#8217;s a marketing piece it&#8217;s a fantastic effort! The basic premise is that Lloyd, the person running the site, is taking a picture of each cup of coffee for a year and posting it online. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/archives/2005/01/01/happy-new-year/category">post that kicked it off</a>. But it&#8217;s not just coffee cups that go up there, it&#8217;s commentary and bits of stories. The consistent serial nature of the updates, along with the nuggets of larger stories placed next to quick notes, really make the blog feel more like a continuous flow than a series of disconnected updates. It&#8217;s weird, it&#8217;s interesting, it&#8217;s a slice of life, and it&#8217;s made me laugh more than once. Thanks Lloyd!</p>
