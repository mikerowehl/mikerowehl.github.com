  <div class="entry-content"><p>The announcement for the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/02/march-mobile-monday.html">March Mobile Monday is up</a>. The topic this time is Mobile Gaming, inspired in large part by the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com">Game Developers Conference</a> being in town at the same time. We&#8217;re going to be over at <a href="http://www.dimension7.com">Dimension7</a> again, cause that&#8217;s right down Folsom from Moscone and should be convenient for all the conference goers.  Here&#8217;s the essential info:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What: March Mobile Monday (Mobile Gaming)</p></li>
<li><p>When: March 7th, 2005 7:00pm</p></li>
<li><p>Where: Dimension7 (150 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA)</p></li>
<li><p>Who: Anyone interested in mobility</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: Nothing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The Mobile Monday events have been going really well, and I expect this one to keep up the trend of steady significant growth. Given that the montly events are going so well, we&#8217;ve been thinking about doing something on a grander scale. Something more like a conference than an evening event. Say a day long conference with multiple speakers, where we can give a speaking spot to some of the people we can&#8217;t fit into these smaller events as well as get prepared for the larger audience some of the more well known personalities are sure to draw. We&#8217;re just getting together some early stage plans now, but as always we&#8217;re looking for whatever help we can find. Just like the evening events, I would like the whole conf to be free to attendees. That could be hard to setup, but if <a href="http://www.bloggercon.com/">BloggerCon</a> can do it I think we can as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a few minutes ago <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/">Fagan</a> popped up on IM and said &#8220;http://geourl.org/ back up.&#8221;  Woohoo!!!! Music to my ears.  <a href="http://www.geourl.com">GeoURL</a> is a service that keeps track of physical locations to go along with web resources. So thanks to GeoURL you can see <a href="http://geourl.org/near?p=http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">web resources near me in the real world</a>. Apparently <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2005/02/25/001178.html">Ask Bjoern Hansen is responsible for the resurrection</a>. Thanks Ask! Of course, being the mobility wonk that I am, I would love a neighbors lookup function based on coordinates rather than existing resources. Tie something like <a href="http://www.tagsurf.com">TagSurf</a> (which allows tagging based on URLs) into the GeoURL lookup. Pull your GPS coords, find URLs of nearby sources, use URLs to pull comments out of Tagsurf. All we need is a layer of FOAF filtering on those results and we&#8217;ve got a decent componentized recommendation system. And I think everyone knows how much Mike hates the silo. Multiple services, acting together, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

<p>Update: I parsed Ask Bjoern Hansen as Ask &#8220;Bjoern Hansen&#8221;, and that&#8217;s not what it is at all. It&#8217;s Ask Bjoern Hansen all as one, his first name is Ask.  Ooops, sorry Ask! Thanks for the correction Fagan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris pointed me to an interview today, and I downloaded the MP3 and tossed it onto my Shuffle almost without thinking about it. Why was I able to do this action naturally and in the manner I choose?  Without switching off my main desktop machine?  Because the 0.98rc1 release of <a href="http://www.blinkenlights.ch/cgi-bin/fm.pl?get=ipode">GNUpod</a> includes the necessary changes to support the iPod Shuffle. It was crippled for a while, and I had to use this attrocious bag of drivers misnamed an operating system in order to do so. But now I can download audio when I want and put them on my device using the programs I choose to. Yay! Thank you GNUpod authors, you rock!</p>

The guest is Jeff Winner, former VP of Engineering at Friendster and current principal in venture accelerator Alacrity Partners, the topic is &#8220;Fundamentals of Financing for Founders: the current funding climate in Silicon Valley&#8221;. The <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=419">last meeting was fantastic</a>, definitely check it out if you get a chance.  They need to make sure they capacity plan correctly, so if you&#8217;re planning to come email jpark at commerce.net.  I&#8217;m not putting the location in here so that people don&#8217;t just show up, like they do with the <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/">Future Salon</a> events. But I will tell you it&#8217;s on March 9th at 7:00pm and on the peninsula.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had this post sitting around for a while, but seeing as Elle has declared this <a href="http://ellementk.com/archives/2005/02/19/297">Blogger Fort Weekend</a> I&#8217;ve decided to get it out now.</p>

<p>The post that kicked it off was <a href="http://www.primidi.com/2005/02/02.html">Sensors Everywhere</a> from  Roland Piquepaille&#8217;s Technology Trends. The post calls out some example solutions from an <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57702816">Information Week article of the same name</a>. I&#8217;m pretty interested in the topic of sensor networks, cause I think  that&#8217;s one of the eventual forms of mobile computing. One theory is that instead of carrying around mobile information devices with us, those mobile information access devices will diffuse into the world around us. For an example already in process, think about services like <a href="http://www.onstar.com/">OnStar</a>, which is an example of mobile information service fusing with a car. Even if that isn&#8217;t the way that things go, it&#8217;s an interesting thought experiment to think about what the world would look like if any object in the physical world could have access to information about both the user and it&#8217;s own surroundings.</p>

<p>Currently that&#8217;s just a thought experiment however. Sensor networks really only work for very predictable deployments. They allow sensors and processing to go places they previously couldn&#8217;t go before. However, they certainly don&#8217;t allow it to go everywhere. We&#8217;re a long way from the vision of <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/mobiletopics/mobile/story/0,10801,79572,00.html">smart dust</a> that can be scattered over an area at will to provide data collection and processing functions. Part of the problem is getting the electronics down to the required size, another is the power problem, and then there&#8217;s the networking problem. The networking problem is one of the places that I think we can pull the most from another technique - <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003068.html">biomimetism</a>. Both mesh networking and distributed processing are problems that are difficult to solve at best. They&#8217;re hard to conceptualize, implement, test, and debug. And even the best systems tend not to be as robust as we would like them to be.</p>

<p>I went to hear Feng Zhao speak at Stanford last year, and corresponded with him a bit. I was very interested in using <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/papers/03/TinyGALS/">TinyGALS</a> for a prototype system that never ended up making it out of concept phase. That&#8217;s a great project they have there, looking at trying to program the network instead of programming individual nodes. But it is still the traditional programming, just aimed at a different level of abstraction. There are projects looking at how to pull useful models from living systems in order to make software and embedded systems better. Even when they do find techniques that can be reused, it&#8217;s hard to merge what they find into traditional software practices. Although the front might be advancing in terms of biomimetic software, there needs to be biomimetic process and operations to go along with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Feedster was awarded <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/archives/2005/02/feedster_awarde_1.html">Best Overall Presentation at the Bay Area Interactive Group (BIG) Technology Shootout</a> last night. The main message presented was the future of XML based formats such as RSS and how they lead to a model that can best be summarized as &#8220;Search, Subscribe, Advertise.&#8221; Search is of course a very broad topic, and subscribe very general. The first thing that pops to mind is of course searching for <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=linux&amp;sort=date">all posts related to Linux</a>, and having a <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?q=linux&amp;sort=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=&amp;content=full&amp;type=rss&amp;feedsterkey=2iWbnYvPbde6QlTY7qhFZq&amp;limit=15">feed for new posts that appear on that topic</a>. But RSS search is the kind of thing that can be applied in layers, almost like a recursive operation. For instance we can provide a <a href="http://feedfinder.feedster.com/search.php?db=feeds&amp;sort=relevance&amp;q=linux">search for FEEDS related to Linux</a>, and a <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?q=linux&amp;sort=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=&amp;content=full&amp;type=rss&amp;feedsterkey=2iWbnYvPbde6QlTY7qhFZq&amp;limit=15&amp;db=feeds">feed of new feeds that appear</a>. No matter how it&#8217;s applied though, the general model of &#8220;Search, Subscribe, Advertise&#8221; best describes how to slot into the desired user behavior. Great job Chris!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there was massive feedback from putting up <a href="http://www.thecoolkids.us/coffee/index.php">The Year of Coffee</a> as the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/fotd.php">Feed of the Day</a>, people really liked it. Happy I could help out! So tonight was my turn to pick the feed again. I&#8217;m a geek at heart. Serious geek. My natural inclination is to put up something about programming languages and getting them to <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">all kinds of strange and spooky things</a>. But that&#8217;s just not interesting stuff for most people. So instead I took a random walk for a while and happened across this gem: <a href="http://www.bicyclemark.org/blog.html">Bicyclemark&#8217;s Communique</a>. Check this out:</p>

<blockquote><p>The exaggerations of a Portuguese-American, radical, activist-journalist, pretend-academic, university employee, podcaster, blog fanatic, living in Amsterdam.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay, I admit it, my curiosity was piqued. I have no idea what to expect, I was a bit off balance. Well done. The post themselves are very amusing. Then I&#8217;m almost at the end of the page and I see this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you feel my blog has been stale this week? I do. It&#8217;s always a matter of opinion of course, sometimes I write shit I hate, and the people say &#8220;hooray.&#8221; Other times I write shit I think is fun, and people say nothin. The other thing is that my podcasting has taken center stage in my mind, and blogging has become like the middle child&#8230; the jan brady.. of my internet activities. Not sure who the Cindy would be.</p></blockquote>

<p>DING DING DING! We have a winner. Podcasting, blogging, the Brady Bunch. All jumbled on top of each other. And not only did I not feel dirty, I laughed. And then a few minutes later I furrowed my brow and though &#8220;Hey&#8230;. I hope I&#8217;m not the Cindy. Or maybe that&#8217;s a good thing?&#8221; Thank you Bicyclemark. Great blog, interesting podcasts. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t have time to post about it when I put it up, but I want to talk about the last Feed of the Day I put up: <a href="http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/index.php">The Year of Coffee</a>. I ran across it cause I have a subscription to a <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=feedster&amp;sort=date">vanity feed for Feedster</a> so that I can see when anyone is talking about us. Fantastic idea, I recommend it for anyone, it&#8217;s amazing the stuff you&#8217;ll find. At first when I looked at it I thought &#8220;hey, is this a stealth blog for <a href="http://www.peets.com">Peet&#8217;s</a>?&#8221; (notice that when I think to myself I insert hyperlinks, sometimes that makes my head hurt). If that&#8217;s a marketing piece it&#8217;s a fantastic effort! The basic premise is that Lloyd, the person running the site, is taking a picture of each cup of coffee for a year and posting it online. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/archives/2005/01/01/happy-new-year/category">post that kicked it off</a>. But it&#8217;s not just coffee cups that go up there, it&#8217;s commentary and bits of stories. The consistent serial nature of the updates, along with the nuggets of larger stories placed next to quick notes, really make the blog feel more like a continuous flow than a series of disconnected updates. It&#8217;s weird, it&#8217;s interesting, it&#8217;s a slice of life, and it&#8217;s made me laugh more than once. Thanks Lloyd!</p>

<time datetime="2005-02-15T08:28:52-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 15<span>th</span>, 2005</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some notes from the <a href="http://softtechvc.blogs.com/software_only/2005/02/from_an_idea_to.html">talk Jeff Clavier gave at BMA</a> this morning. A lot of the talk was about the enterprise side of the equation. &#8220;What does it take to get an enterprise software play to market&#8221; type of questions. But the discussion started out with a preface not to take generalizations too seriously. People will say &#8220;VCs don&#8217;t really do that&#8221; or &#8220;you&#8217;re never going to see that from a VC&#8221;, but that needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Normally these statements are overgeneralized. Different VCs act differently, and behavior that you would never see from one group may not be that uncommon from another. So pay attention and make sure to contextualize the information you get.</p>

<p>First off, it&#8217;s hard to create an enterprise startup. Something like 10,000 enterprise software companies were funded during the bubble, and of those about 5 or 6 thousand remain. That&#8217;s a lot of competition. Even if you pick a niche to fill, it can still be very difficult. There are 20 or 30 storage companies for example, entry into that area is very costly and risky. VCs in general recognize that there was an over investment in enterprise plays. It&#8217;s not that they won&#8217;t back a play like this, it just tends to be the very big deal and it has to be something differentiated.</p>

<p>There are four main factors that commonly go into evaluating an opportunity: whitespace, direct experience, disruption, and the team:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first is the idea itself. How good is the idea?  How differentiated is it? Jeff said this is called &#8220;whitespace&#8221; sometimes, the blank area between the idea you have and the adjacent ideas. Map out the whitespace and make sure the area is big enough. Is it referencable whitespace? Can you explain to investors why your idea is different?</p></li>
<li><p>Direct experience in putting the solution together, like the &#8220;scratch your own itch&#8221; maxim from open source, is a good litmus test for the general validity of the product. If you made your product because you needed it yourself, there&#8217;s a good chance others out there might need it also.</p></li>
<li><p>Disruption means cost savings in some way. It may be a sea change in technology that drives cost reduction, or new methods, or a new business model. But it needs to be something big. The savings needs to be significant enough to outweigh the risk of switching to the new system.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes teams of people just work right. People will toss money at them just to see what happens. If your team has a proven track record it can go a long way toward helping out with the current effort. Jeff said something like if you have the right people you can paint anything on &#8220;the canvas of the team&#8221;, I liked that turn of phrase. Sifry mentioned <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=419">paying attention to the corporate DNA that you&#8217;re building</a> last week. This is always important, funding or no funding. There&#8217;s just no substitute for having good people willing to work together.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Based on your idea you have to define how you sell and what your ecosystem looks like. Ecosystem means your customers, competitors, partners, and people who might be either competitors or partners. How high of a hurdle is there for market entry? Who can you potentially target as a partner? Sizing of the market is one of the most difficult things to do. Pick meaningful numbers. The size of the market overall means nothing, the addressable portion of the market is what you need to know. Everyone likes to say they will have 20 or 40 percent of the market, and that simply never happens. You&#8217;re lucky if it&#8217;s 1 or 2 percent. Look at behavior within the ecosystem. What are the purchase habits, what is the lead time, budgets, deployment time? What are the trends? Lots of funding in an area is a predictor of price pressure, it&#8217;s actually not a good thing. Get out there and talk to people. Network with others in your market. Find people who have started successful businesses in the same area. Research online as well. There are sure to be blogs that give info about the area.</p>

<p>Sharing your sale with a consulting company is not &#8220;leaving value on the table&#8221;, it&#8217;s part of building your ecosystem. Of course you have to find the right consulting company, someone who won&#8217;t take the money and run. Eventually that consultancy can be a valuable partner, helping to bring you business.</p>

<p>Frequently there is a point at which you have to choose continued growth or profitability. If you need to reinvest enough of your profits to keep growing, and you need money to do so, that&#8217;s a good time to think about funding. You need the right mix of growth, partnerships, differentiation, and guts to keep growing though. That&#8217;s true if you need funding or not. If you want sustainability you need diversity. Diversified revenue and multiple product lines. It&#8217;s hard to get real big with a singular focus. How do you measure diversity against a loss of focus? Make sure you have a repeatable sales process for what you have and that the product is up and established before looking at adjacent opportunities.</p>

<p>What can you do as entrepreneurs? Find people who want to join for no pay. Find people with the same passion and the same willingness to take a risk. Network. Try to find like-minded people and they&#8217;ll show you to the pockets of cash needed to keep your business up and going. Find VCs speaking at events. The VCs are out there normally cause they&#8217;re looking to tap into deals, they&#8217;re receptive then. Give them your elevator pitch and gage their interest. Don&#8217;t bother cold calling on VCs, it&#8217;s not worth the time. If the VC seems interested, cozy up to their assistant. The VCs assistant is your best connection, they have great info for you (where the VC is, how you can contact them, when they&#8217;ll be back, etc). Mine your own network. Find people with connections to VCs, strong connections, connections that get phone calls returned. Sometimes you can do premarket meetings with VCs. If you&#8217;re not ready for funding you can present what you are working on, just to get their feedback and educate them somewhat. Then when you&#8217;re ready for funding they&#8217;re already familiar with you and what your position is.</p>
