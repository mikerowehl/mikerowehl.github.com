  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently monkeys are being <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=healthNews&amp;storyID=2005-08-23T134543Z_01_SCH349470_RTRIDST_0_HEALTH-SLEEP-DEPRIVATION-DC.XML">given a new drug to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation</a>. And I&#8217;m sitting here drinking my Mountain Dew like a sucker. Now I admit it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been to the zoo, but I do see the occasional monkey flick on one of the nature channels. It doesn&#8217;t seem to me that there would be a real market in monkey stimulants. Except maybe for the big guy, who had tanks and airplanes to contend with while carying a screaming Faye Wray. That looked pretty stressful. I just can&#8217;t see your average monkey pulling too many 30-36 hour hacking sprees. Now silicon Valley, there&#8217;s some monkeys who could use &#8220;facilitated attentional processes related to speed.&#8221; It would have come in really handy at <a href="http://barcamp.org">BARcamp</a> I bet. I say this is unfair discrimination. Why are the monkeys getting all the good drugs first?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are two great posts over at <a href="http://lue.dyn.dhs.org/index.html">Linux, Unit, /etc/</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://lue.dyn.dhs.org/2005/20050720130900.html">An Introduction to M4</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://lue.dyn.dhs.org/2005/20050722134020.html">Unix Web Hacks</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Together they describe both M4 and how to make use of it to carry out some webbish tasks like wrapping content in common markup. I know, I know. &#8220;Der, just use WordPress or something.&#8221; No. Software comes from somewhere, and the people who make it need to learn how to do things. For every useful and interesting hack there are at least 10 stupid little prototypes, tests, mashups, and minor modifications. The closer your starting point can be to your ending point the better off you (probably) are. More examples using more toolsets for more problems, that&#8217;s cool. So generating HTML with a macro processor that has roots back into Fortran, sure, that&#8217;s cool. I don&#8217;t want to do it right now, but if ever I&#8217;m looking for an example to start with I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be happy it&#8217;s there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve thought about systems like <a href="http://www.mosix.org/">Mosix</a> and their process migration ability with relation to moving about from one system to another. I would love to be able to just take a session from my desktop at work and start it up on my laptop or my desktop at home. I figured it would be great to have something like the <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5772921353.html">Intel Personal Server</a> to enable that. But apparently there&#8217;s another effort called <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2778922637.html">SoulPad</a> (via <a href="http://rootprompt.org/article.php3?article=9026">Rootprompt</a>) in the works as well. It&#8217;s a migration layer for a whole hosted operating system. Nice. I would love to see it based on <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs</a> instead of VMware, but mostly I just want it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The kick ass folks over at <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a> are hosting <a href="http://barcamp.org/">BAR Camp</a> in Palo Alto while FOO Camp is going on. Definitely very cool! I&#8217;m right down in Palo Alto, so I should be able to make it. Friday might be a bit rough&#8230; but it&#8217;s not like I have to wander too far away. Gotta figure out what to demo though&#8230; It&#8217;ll have to be some mobile sideproject. So many things to choose from!! Python hackery for Series60 is always easy to toss together. I had a good idea for an app which I&#8217;ve never implemented all the way, maybe this would be the time. I was gonna use Python and Flickr to pull thumbnails for everyone in my address book who has a Flickr account. That way little faces would pop up next to caller ID info. That&#8217;s always sexy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Next Friday (August 19th) there&#8217;s a Future Salon titled <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/08/poetry_of_brain.html">Poetry of Brains</a>. <a href="http://www.deepdarksee.com/">Spencer</a> pinged to say he was going, and it&#8217;s been too long since I&#8217;ve been to a Future Salon event. And I admit it, I&#8217;m a silicon AI fan. Despite the failure of efforts so far to create working models, I just can&#8217;t read Neuromancer and not think about how cool it would be to have an AI wandering around somewhere scheming against its creators. Or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/6304493681/104-4927830-6823146?v=glance">Ghost in the Shell</a>? Come on, admit it.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a new Italian restaurant downtown Palo Alto.  They&#8217;ve been open for dinner for the last few month, but just started opening for lunch last week. The food is really good, and because it&#8217;s new it&#8217;s not yet crowded during lunch. The meat lasagne with bechamel is easily as good as Mike&#8217;s Cafe in Menlo Park, which is saying A LOT. And they have an excellent espresso.  I think I might just stop by for the coffee on the days when I don&#8217;t eat there. They have a <a href="http://www.veroristorante.com/">placeholder website up</a> (cause it&#8217;s Palo Alto, of course), but the restaurant is up and going. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&amp;country=US&amp;addtohistory=&amp;searchtab=home&amp;address=530+Bryant+st&amp;city=palo+alto&amp;state=ca&amp;zipcode=">map</a>. It&#8217;s on Bryant right between University and Hamilton (530 Bryant St.), very convenient.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Databases almost always start to suck if you&#8217;re trying to build a scalable system. I like relational databases. Databases are great when you&#8217;re putting together an application  that needs to be used by hundreds or thousands of people. However, once it starts to get to Internet scale, lots of applications need to move to something different. Take a look at <a href="http://www.oliviertravers.com/archives/2004/12/29/inside-livejournals-backend/">the Livejournal backend</a> presentation if you&#8217;re curious what I&#8217;m talking about. Once you get to systems like that maximum distribution of the service is really what you want to end up with. And I mean distribution of ALL resources. That includes stuff like network interfaces and memory busses. As in, if every request is really completely independent then you&#8217;re better off with two single processor machines than you are with one dual processor machine. Dual processor systems still tend to share a memory bus, they share a network interface (especially in the world of x86 based Linux systems).  Sometimes they even share cache lines. All of that means contention where there doesn&#8217;t need to be any. Dual processor systems make sense where the individual stages of a single requests allow for decomposition into two associated tasks that benefit from being able to pass information from one stage to another via local services. But if what you&#8217;re doing is throwing compute cycles at a problem that&#8217;s been architected for maximum distribution, your best bet is lots of small systems rather than a few large ones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went out to Defcon last weekend too.  Presentations were fantastic, people were great. Yes, Vegas was hot. No, I didn&#8217;t die. Yes, there are real hackers there. No, I can&#8217;t put you in touch with them. Besides a ton of amusing info, like spoofing a root DNS server while executing an intentially blunt attack for IDS to find you and start autoshunning the name system (teehehehehe) to information about physical locks like spool pins and what a dual ball locking padlock is and why you should care. There was a great presentation about penetration testing the backbone that mentioned <a href="http://www.theregister.com/2005/08/02/cisco_exploits/">the horrid horrid mistakes that Cisco is making</a>. If you have anything to do with security and/or networking equipment I highly recommend paying attention to what Cisco is doing and never EVER doing anything of the sort. It&#8217;s stupid. I&#8217;m sure all those companies calling me looking for help creating Linux based backbone networking equiptment are just drooling over the huge hole that Cisco has left for them to drive through.</p>

We haven&#8217;t decided on a topic for Sept yet, so mail me if you have ideas.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s something about Suse and Yast that I&#8217;m supposed to like. Maybe once I get to know it more I will like it. But I have a 64 bit desktop system I&#8217;m using now, running Suse Enterprise 9.2, and I have absolutely no idea where to look for packages that don&#8217;t show up when I search in the Yast tool. Fortunately it&#8217;s a nice beefy system, so I was able to compile Firefox and Thunderbird and a bunch of other tools when I wasn&#8217;t able to find packaged versions. But I&#8217;ve run into a bunch of annoying incompatabilities. Take <a href="http://spellbound.sourceforge.net">Spellbound</a> for example. I love Spellbound, I can&#8217;t spell at all. I use &#8216;a&#8217; where I should use &#8216;e&#8217;, I love to use &#8216;z&#8217; where it&#8217;s completely inappropriate, and &#8216;i&#8217; comes before &#8216;e&#8217; about 50% of the time depending on my mood. But I can&#8217;t get Spellbound to work with my local compile of Firefox. Why?  Ummm&#8230; I have no idea. Every time I install it everything seems to go fine. But when I restart it tells me it can&#8217;t load the extension, I need to reinstall. Is it cause the core of FF is compiled for x86_64 and the spellcheck libs it installs are for 32 bit? I replaced the libs and xpi from the packaged spelling library with the versions from my Thunderbird compile (which does spell checking fine, W00T!), but that certainly didn&#8217;t fix it at all. Running firefox from the command line and looking for errors didn&#8217;t help at all either, nothing there that gave me any hints. So I&#8217;m kinda sad. But mostly I feel sorry for you folks, who have to now deal with reading something rife with spelling errors.</p>
