  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/pda/blue_dock.html">article over at MobileWhack</a> about a desktop cradle called the Blue Dock. It allows a PDA to be used like a full desktop system, with keyboard, monitor, and network connection. Still not available for quite some time, but it does work somewhat towards an idea that <a href="http://www.rohdesign.com/weblog/archives/000266.html">Mike Rohde was also talking about recently</a>. I&#8217;ve been following systems based on the MCC, such as the <a href="http://www.antelopetech.com/en/index.aspx">products from Antelope</a>, for a while now. The concept has been around the block a few times, and it would appear to me that the technology has been up to the task for a while. The iPod seems to be an excellent example of a compact system with almost all the trimmings necessary to serve as a computing core. But something has kept these little guys out of the mass market. They seem like a great idea to me, but I guess I could be in a very small minority who would go for a device like this. Perhaps once the wireless technologies have a little longer to ferment we&#8217;ll see something like the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1269604,00.asp">Personal Servers</a> that Intel has been working on instead. There&#8217;s <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5772921353.html">quite a bit of info about them available already</a>, and of course I&#8217;m quite happy that all those technologies seem to be Linux friendly (hell, the article is at LinuxDevices.com, how much better can it get?!?)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100338">article at TheFeature</a> about PalmOne deciding that smartphones are going to be way bigger than PDAs in the future. It says that PalmOne is going to be shifting attention away from PDAs cause they see sales being relatively flat in that area. I can certainly agree there, it does seem like smartphones are getting snapped up pretty quick. But I also have heard quite a lot about cellular data networks really being in a lot of financial trouble. To give a concrete example, <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=105">Paul Saffo mentioned that people within the 3G and 4G industries were really nervous</a>. The numbers indicate that those technologies are trending towards failure. I would question if the smartphones being used are really an indicator of convergence. Are people getting smartphones so that they can work over the cellular network? Or are people getting smartphones so that they have PDA functions and still only have to carry one device? I hope that people use the data functions, I would like to see the cellular networks succeed and grow. Maybe people are using the data functions in smartphones, but smartphone adoption isn&#8217;t enough to affect the  figures for cellular data significantly. My unfounded feeling is that setting up the data services you want is still too difficult and restrictive for the normal user. There are services that cellular providers can setup to make this a bit easier for users, but these tend to be too restrictive for early adopters. The only applications that have really been addressed on cellular networks are sending pictures and images, and even these are done mostly with the network as both originator and recipient. There is a whole different level of applications capability, network capability, and support which is needed to make richer applications available. This does not yet exist.</p>

<p>I can certainly see that smartphone sales would be strong, they are the new technology. Many people were waiting for wide area wireless devices because they didn&#8217;t want to use the multiple device bluetooth or cable solution. They held off for a unified device because the chore of setting up your PDA to connect to your cell phone, figuring out all the settings and trying to troubleshoot problems which a configuration that the vendors couldn&#8217;t really support, this was just too much for them to bother with. But I think that there are other problems lurking behind the setup issue. Once you get beyond the device compatibility issue you have a network and service compatibility issue. I think that those who picked up smartphones are going to find that they traded troubles hooking up one device to another for trouble in browsing websites on a small screen and configuring mail server settings. I hope that these new users aren&#8217;t just headed for disenchantment in terms of the network functions. At least in their case they have PDA functions in the same device as their phone, so it isn&#8217;t completely useless. Not completely useless, like getting a Bluetooth card for a PalmOS 4 device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to <a href="http://freedomtechnologycenter.org/classes/tc/">Seth Schoen&#8217;s class on trusted computing</a> at the <a href="http://freedomtechnologycenter.org/">Freedom Technology Center</a> yesterday. The class itself was GREAT! Trusted computing is an area that I really wanted to learn about, but never had the time for. This was a chance to get a whole boatload of info in one big braindump. Seth did a great job of presenting an overview and then delving into some details. This was perfect for me cause I was coming in with little background. Given the set of info that&#8217;s available online already, I think it will probably only take a bit of &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; to provide a nice resource for those looking to learn about what makes up trusted computing, and what is currently being worked on. So as I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=122">promised a few days ago</a>, I&#8217;m going to atone for my sins in recommending the Stanford VLAB security event and provide some real info. I have developed a very strong opinion on the issue, so you&#8217;re going to get that as well.</p>

<p>Trusted Computing is a term used to describe one of a number of efforts which attempt to make computers more secure. In particular, this effort aims to provide a way in which the software running on a system can be verified. Verifying software is important because worms and viruses and various other attacks normally aim at inserting new software into a system, or modifying the existing software. If the user of a computer could be sure that they were only running the software they expected to it would afford them an additional level of security which doesn&#8217;t exist today. The verification of software is done by what is called &#8220;measuring&#8221; the running software. This is different than what I expected, because the trusted computing initiatives that Seth discussed DO NOT keep a program from running at any point, they just allow the user to uncover an unauthorized change to software. Measuring software is done in part by adding new hardware to the PC architecture, but also includes a number of new software mechanisms.  Seth wrote a detailed paper called <a href="http://www.eff.org/Infra/trusted_computing/20031001_tc.php">Trusted Computing: Promise and Risk</a>. It lays down the architecture in general as well as the capabilities that are provided.</p>

<p>Something that might not be obvious from the paper is that there are what seem to be three different areas of software and hardware that need to be present in order for a full trusted computing solution to work.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The hardware used to do measurement of software.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes to the standard hardware architecture in order to accommodate this measuring chip</p></li>
<li><p>Changes to the software running on the secured system.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For those looking for even more indepth information there&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.trustedcomputing.org/home">atform Alliance</a>, which provides information about the measurement hardware. Both Intel and AMD have their own versions of the hardware changes needed to make trusted computing possible. Intel calls their version <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/security/index.htm">LaGrande Technology (LT)</a>, and the version from AMD is called Secure Execution Mode (SEM). I haven&#8217;t been able to pull up much info about the AMD effort, but there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1274119,00.asp">very good overview of LaGrande</a> from ExtremeTech. The last piece of the puzzle is the operating system support. Microsoft has been doing a lot of work in this area, with a project that was first called Palladium, but is now called the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/ngscb/default.mspx">Next Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB)</a>. There&#8217;s a lot of information out there if you&#8217;re into the technical details. Right now I&#8217;m going to stick with a few overall concepts however.</p>

<p>I went into the class thinking what I think most people think - that trusted computing could in some way keep me from running the software that I want on my system. I thought that if trusted computing were to happen I might not be able to run Linux on some future version of hardware. This isn&#8217;t true at all because trusted computing doesn&#8217;t allow for halting the system because of rogue software. It just isn&#8217;t part of the plan. Looking at <a href="http://www.eff.org/Infra/trusted_computing/20031001_tc.php">the Trusted Computing paper</a>, the four major areas of functionality are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Memory curtaining</p></li>
<li><p>Secure input and output</p></li>
<li><p>Sealed storage</p></li>
<li><p>Remote attestation</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And most of the functionality there is of benefit even when running an alternative system like Linux. The sealed storage concept in general was something I wasn&#8217;t aware of, and it could provide a lot of benefit in general. I think I still prefer traditional encryption to the sealed storage concept, but I could see how the technology in general would be a benefit to most people. But even so, I have a lot of doubts about it. More on that later.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the big deal then? Why is everyone so irked about the use of these trusted computing technologies if they can&#8217;t really interfere with the use of a PC in general, and they provide a lot of benefit? The problem lies in the last point from that list, the remote attestation. This is described in some detail in the paper, but in brief it allows for a remote entity to determine the configuration of software you&#8217;re running on your computer. There are some valid reasons for this to be used, reasons which I agree with in principle. It could be used when accessing your bank account so that your bank can make sure you aren&#8217;t using a system which has been compromised, or it could be used by an online game server to ensure that none of the participants was cheating. Those uses are pretty cool, but even though there are valid uses this is really where the problems start to come in most drastically. Remote attestation is a mechanism that vendors can use to deliver data or services only to people running &#8220;approved&#8221; configurations of software. For me, this is something that&#8217;s completely unacceptable. It is my feeling that companies would use this to perpetuate anti-competitive behavior. They engage in anti-competitive behavior already, but the remote attestation would make the mechanisms for their discrimination an explicit part of the architecture. I don&#8217;t think someone else has a right to tell me how I can access a service any more than I think a bus driver should have a right to determine who&#8217;s allowed to get on a bus based on their race. Neither has anything at all to do with the service being provided. I do not trust the law in this case to regulate the use of remote attestation in such as way that it can be used for beneficial purposes without being used for detrimental purposes. Simply not using the service is an obvious answer, but this doesn&#8217;t really work in practice. Access to the service can still be used to pressure users to use approved software; otherwise they can&#8217;t interact with those who do have access to the service/data. This could be a huge hindrance to that class of users. Think of being cut off from the phone network unless you had an AT&amp;T phone. You could just not use a phone at all, but it would be a huge pain in the ass.  Seth goes into some detail about other nefarious uses of both remote attestation and sealed storage in his paper.</p>

<p>So there&#8217;s the groundwork. Trusted computing isn&#8217;t used for the nefarious purposes I originally thought it could be, and there are both good and bad points to what it can be used for. In my opinion sealed storage is mostly cool, remote attestation is both good and bad almost equally. So what is my new outlook on the technology? Do I think it&#8217;s the horrid demon that I used to think it was? Fuck yes!! If anything, I think it&#8217;s even worse than it appeared to be. Now that I understand trusted computing more fully I think it could be the Antichrist. Once trusted computing devices get released I don&#8217;t think it would be long before it starts raining toads and the seas start to boil, the end of the world will be at hand.</p>

<p>The reason I have such huge problems with it is that it seems like it provides some benefits, although there are what seem like some slight problems. However, when we really think about the &#8220;slight problems&#8221; and compare what they could be used for against what companies are actually doing, we should see that they really will be huge problems. I&#8217;m assuming this is why Seth has been trying to advance the idea of an Owner Override for the remote attestation. I don&#8217;t agree that attestation is the only problem though. I think sealed storage is an issue also. I don&#8217;t want my programs to be able to put stuff on my hard drive that only it can access! It is cool that programs could store data which only they can access, but I think this will also be abused. If I use one program to create a chunk of content, that content is mine. It does not, nor do I want it to, belong to the software that created it. I might want the data to act like that, but I want the control of that behavior to be in my hands. The combination of the tamperproof TCPA hardware and software that can verify what environment it&#8217;s running in could result in programs which can effectively lock me out of my own data. This abdication of control, even though it could result in security in some cases, I find unacceptable. The trusted computing environment boils down to turning over control of your system in certain cases to someone else&#8217;s hardware and software. As Seth also brings up, even the user of the computer is at times viewed as an adversary.I am not willing to give up that control. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. If keeping my system completely under my control means that I have to spend a lot more time guarding it that&#8217;s just the price that has to be paid. If it means that I might lose my private info or have a virus infect my system that&#8217;s just a risk I&#8217;ll have to expose myself to for now. That is not to say that I don&#8217;t think that computer security needs to be improved upon. It does. I don&#8217;t think that giving up control of my computer to someone else is the way that I would like to get to greater security. I do not trust trusted computing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While joking in the IRC channel at <a href="http://www.pilot-link.org">pilot-link</a> setuid pointed me to <a href="http://nitroracing.org/sco/comments.php?article=3207">an analysis of Darl McBride&#8217;s behavior</a>. It is a pretty funny read on its own, but what struck me after reading even a few of the quotes from Darl is that he doesn&#8217;t understand that everyone benefits from using open source, even software vendors (the competent ones at least). He seems to think that people using open source software means that the commercial software market is dead. That is not what it means at all. It means that software vendors have to ADD VALUE in what they do. It  means that they can&#8217;t just sell the same old piece of shit year after year and expect to protect their &#8220;market position&#8221; using the law. Darl thinks that he has a right to sell software because he has customers. Weird. For some reason Darl thinks that the only way that software can get written and that ideas can be formed is by people working in companies:</p>

<blockquote><p>McBride makes no bones about turning his back on the Linux community, or the fact that doing so may hurt SCO&#8217;s business. &#8220;We have customers in two camps, those who respect intellectual property, and those who don&#8217;t. We&#8217;re setting the standard. The whole world doesn&#8217;t spin around a free model. There&#8217;s no free lunch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>What a fucknut. Open source advocates don&#8217;t want to steal the technology that SCO owns. Almost everyone I know who works on open source projects wouldn&#8217;t have taken an handout from SCO even before this whole thing started. That&#8217;s because open source projects can make better software. Open source isn&#8217;t about stealing IP from others and reusing it in free projects, what it&#8217;s really about is the realization that the computer industry doesn&#8217;t do well in terms of making products. And that yes, a group of loosely affiliated people can do a better job if what they&#8217;re working towards is simply making a good set of software.</p>

<p>The basis for why this would be is laid down in <em>Innovation: The Attacker&#8217;s Advantage</em> (sorry, no link available, but you can find it on Amazon). The basic reason is that once a company has a customer base they have a set of restrictions on how they can operate and what they can do. The conclusion of the book is that someone coming into a market normally has an advantage, and that once they enter the market they lose the advantage. This is certainly true in the software industry, and it has led to companies trying to protect their market using all sorts of anti-competitive behavior. The flawed software patent and intellectual property system in the US doesn&#8217;t do anything to help the situation either. These protectionist behaviors, such as vendor lockin and file formats that are not interoperable, led many people to take interes in open source. Even if open source was initially mainly worked on by college students and individuals to try to move away from corporate control of software, more and more companies are realizing that they can work around the traditional barriers to entry placed in their way by older corporations by working with open source. Because part of their solution can be made from open source and the rest their new product, they see this as an opportunity to avoid the creation of needless overhead and focus on their core competency. This leads to leaner business plans and quicker time to market. For most people this means a maximization of their profits. They work on only the high value areas in which they can create the most value. They do less work, but they get more for the work they do.</p>

<p>For some reason Darl thinks that this is an unworkable situation. He thinks that this results in companies not being able to sell software. He thinks that groups working together to make their combined situation better is somehow &#8220;communist&#8221;. I wonder if he thinks that efforts such as those carried on at the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">W3C</a> are communist as well. Those are efforts which work to create a standard involving both multiple companies and interested individuals. There really is a strong parallel between writing a standard and producing a standard piece of software, especially if the software you&#8217;re producing is based on a standard. What happens there is that you move the bar up in terms of expectation. The more parts of a system that are standard commodity, the more a user can expect from a solution. Software providers can no longer make money off selling just a base solution. If users can get free software off the Internet, that doesn&#8217;t mean that they won&#8217;t ever buy software. It means that the software has to provide more value than the free solution. It means that software makers have to add something to the base in order to be able to charge for it. If having companies produce a standard so that they can be sure that all their parts work together makes sense, why doesn&#8217;t it make sense to have the same groups produce the parts of the system which are pure overhead? Group effort has existed for a long time, but Darl thinks that open source is wrong for allowing the maximum number of people to benefit from it. Weird.</p>

<p>I actually just started thinking through the parallel between standards authoring and authoring open source as I wrote this, and I really like it. I think it provides a strong argument against the &#8220;free lunch&#8221; argument that Darl keeps using. Open source is not a free lunch, it&#8217;s a potluck dinner. It&#8217;s a case where lots of people bringing together what they have and sharing it have managed to create something much more enjoyable than the pieces taken individually. Potluck dinners are not free however, everyone has to put something in. Sure, people may show up without a dish and be allowed to eat anyway, especially if there&#8217;s more than enough food for those already present. But potluck dinners don&#8217;t mean that there are no resturaunts. It just means that resturaunts can&#8217;t charge for food which is just as easy to make at home and the same in all other respects. Welcome to what the rest of us call a free market. Darl thinks this is communist. Weird.</p>

<p>Darl&#8217;s insistence that open source is a free lunch really shows how much he misunderstands the issue. Not that I can completely blame him for misunderstanding in the first place, even some open souce advocates don&#8217;t understand how value creation within the open source environment actually works. But he is the CEO of a major company. I would expect he would educate himself a bit. Either that, or the shareholders would rally and find a way to get him replaced. If he doesn&#8217;t see how open source would work to his shareholder&#8217;s and customer&#8217;s benefit I don&#8217;t think he should be making any decisions on their behalf at all. Yet still, with all this ineptitude, he&#8217;s still there and still blathering on. Weird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/01/23.html#a895">post by John Udell</a> about database lockin. I think the issue with SQL dialect lockin is probably more troublesome. I agree that transport independence is a problem though. Databases have been like this for a long time - a standard language to query them, but different libraries for the different databases to actually access them. There&#8217;s probably some issue in there that I&#8217;m not aware of that keeps it from happening, but why isn&#8217;t there a standard transport? ODBC is cool, but it&#8217;s a shim on the application end to allow different drivers to be swapped in as needed. At least in all the uses I have seen. Is there an &#8220;ODBC native&#8221; format that can be used by an RDBMS? I&#8217;m thinking probably not. And if so, why is no one using it? For the proprietary systems like Oracle and DB2 I could certainly see why, they don&#8217;t want people to be able to switch easily. But for open source databases why isn&#8217;t there transport level standardization? Any database gurus out there who might know the answer, please chime in. I vaguely remember something about an XML based query exchange from a number of years ago. That ever make it anywhere?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.beecon.de/howto/pose_bt/index.html">This site</a> describes how to use a physical bluetooth device from a POSE session running under Linux. That&#8217;s just really cool. I with the people actually at Palm would realize the market they lost in open source advocates, but if that isn&#8217;t going to happen at least a couple of talented people can provide an alternative. Of course, this only works for emulating older devices, Palm doesn&#8217;t have anything available for Linux to simulate their newest devices. Thank you <a href="http://www.beecon.de/index.html">BeeCon</a>, this is a great tool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There  are <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Damonv/Public/Doombolt/">images online</a> from a couple of people who constructed a high speed photo lab using a BASIC stamp and some off the shelf parts. I have no idea how expensive high speed photography normally is, or just how hard it is to construct one of these, but the pictures are pretty. I think it&#8217;s also cool they did it for $40, although I&#8217;m assuming that doesn&#8217;t include air compressor, controller, and the various cameras they used. I figured the flash would be the hard part given their description, but it says they just used the flash from a disposable. Mmmmm, impaled fruit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>RSS WinterFest is an RSS webcast that went on over the last two days. Along with the webcast went a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest/index.cgi">wiki</a> a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest/index.cgi?action=weblog_display&amp;category=RSS%20Winterfest%20Weblog">weblog</a> and tons of other resources linked in through both of those. There are some great points brought up, and some points that I really don&#8217;t agree with but might have to put some thought into. I also found <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">Roland&#8217;s blog</a> quite useful, as he seems to be interested in a lot of the same areas as I am. I had trouble connecting to the actual cast the first day, and didn&#8217;t have the time to listen in live for most of today. I wish I could have, the information linked in and generated by the event seems to be of very high quality. This is a group that&#8217;s really taking the time to work through the issues beyond the technical details of getting down a file format. I liked the points under Syndication in the Enterprise from Bill French in particular. Once I work myself out from under the pile of crud I have to do now I need to finish up the Palm XMLPRC work and get onto some of this stuff as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/">Weblogger Meetup</a> in San Francisco last night, but only one other person showed up. I think that it just isn&#8217;t going to happen at all. During December lots of people showed cause the crew from <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> were there. But besides the people that <a href="http://shellen.com/">Jason Shellen</a> invited, and the people that I invited, there wasn&#8217;t anyone new. This time around I sent out some emails and got not much response, but figured that there might be people there anyway. I was wrong. Not a big deal, communities shift over time. I guess there just aren&#8217;t many  people into the technologies looking to meet.</p>

<p>The question does still remain about the Meetup site. It doesn&#8217;t encourage people to really communicate. It&#8217;s very difficult to talk, one member to another, to try to find out what is going on. I&#8217;m sure that Meetup likes this, cause long lists of people make it look like they&#8217;re very active. Even if less than ten percent of the listed participants actually show up. So I am somewhat curious if another form of organization would help out getting people together, or are people just not interested at all? I just ran across <a href="http://www.sfbaybloggers.com/">SFBayBloggers</a> in poking around and looking to answer that question. Hard to tell from looking at that site how active it is. There do seem to be some recent entries in the discussion forums at least.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that now that blogging is passe for the technically elite, they&#8217;ve either lost interest or have started working somewhere that they do this as a job. Both normally lead to people being less interested in meeting up informally about the topic. I see the whole blogging issue as just starting out really. Sure, the geeky work of getting blogging tools up and going, and coming up with some new formats and categories of metadata is starting to mature. That is the relatively easy part though. Create some tools to make a website easy to update, big deal. Guestbooks for sites have existed almost since the first support for HTML forms in browsers, they&#8217;re pretty much the same thing. Bring up a form, write an entry, see it online. Easy.</p>

<p>The harder parts are trying to bring about the real changes that stem from this. Now that it is easy to update a website, and we do have ways to link sites together, aggregate content, and mark up individual entries; how do we actually use this system without it falling apart? And falling apart can mean anything from people losing interest, to spammers taking over commenting, to information overload making it impossible to find what you&#8217;re looking for. But as is the tradition in Silicon Valley, now that the technical problems are solved no one is interested. There is a new medium here, and there are new ways to use it. It does enable all the methods of communication that the geeks used to spout off about, but it doesn&#8217;t yet do so for the average user. It still takes a geek to be able to understand the medium well enough to work with it as envisioned. Maybe everyone thinks this is the cost of entry, and how to avoid information overloading the system. Me, I just think they&#8217;re not looking at the question at all. There are lots of unsolved problems around blogging, and a lot of them really have nothing to do with &#8220;blogging technology&#8221; at all. They have to deal with use of the data as information, use of multiple discreet points of information production being used by large bases of consumers, and basically defining a new form of media. This just isn&#8217;t interesting I guess. No wonder tech has remained in the ditches for so long. I would have hoped that the bubble bursting would have taught people that technology alone is not enough to sustain the industry. It takes connecting technology to real world problems, and then FULLY solving them. Not just pointing at a technology and saying &#8220;hey, you can use that to do what you want&#8221;. Unless it does exactly what users want it isn&#8217;t completed yet.</p>
