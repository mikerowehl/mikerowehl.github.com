  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/06/issue/invite.asp?p=1">Good-Bye to Venture Capital</a> (link via <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2005/05/howard_anderson.html">Brad Feld</a>) and the whole thing seems to stand in stark contrast to what I&#8217;ve been seeing. I tend to agree more with <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/05/parting_shots.html">Fred Wilson</a>. A couple of odd things have happened directly to me over the last few weeks. Mind you, my take on this might be a bit skewed compared to other folks in Silicon Valley. I wasn&#8217;t here for the boom, I kinda missed that whole thing. I moved here mid 2001, when most people seemed to be headed out of the area and not into it. I&#8217;m not quite sure how the whole boom got started or what it looked like from the inside. But I can tell you that the previous 4 years here were nothing like the last 2 months.</p>

<p>First of all, there&#8217;s the requests that come through <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a>. We started up the group because we thought there wasn&#8217;t all that much innovative work happening in the valley with respect to mobility. It seemed like Europe was way ahead on this one, they have the huge penetration they must have the innovation. I was wrong. After starting the group innovative companies just came pouring out of the woodwork. They were out there, they just weren&#8217;t making much noise. They were below the radar of even someone like myself, who has worked in the area for a while and in general decently in tune with the technologies. Then I went over to Europe for a conference on mobility and saw the things they&#8217;re working on. The innovation is here, I&#8217;m now completely convinced. A lot of those innovators aren&#8217;t looking to VCs for funding however, and for some reason the VCs aren&#8217;t looking for them. There&#8217;s a disjoin between innovative technologies and the markets they best serve - I thought that&#8217;s what VCs were supposed to help with in part. I think some of the folks are smart enough to pull off some amazing runs. But they&#8217;re probably going to be doing it on their own.</p>

<p>The second odd thing is the number of calls I get. In my former life I did a shitload of Linux embedded systems programming, and my resume is still slanted pretty heavy in that direction. I&#8217;ve been getting unsolicited calls and emails at an increasing pace lately from folks looking to kill some existing business model using open source. The concentration seems to be pretty heavily on the networking and appliances side. I talked to three different companies yesterday alone, one of whom specifically says they&#8217;re &#8220;going straight for Cisco&#8221;. Now, granted, plays like this are pretty rational market. Open source for something like a networking device is more of an optimization than a disruption at the market level. But what happens in the adjacent areas should be pretty interesting. I think that in a few months the buzzwords might shift from the long tail to the <a href="http://management.itmanagersjournal.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/10/2052216&amp;tid=85#TheOptimizationStrategy">conservation of modularity</a> ideas that Clayton Christensen presented at the Open Source Business Conference.</p>

<p>So maybe that means nothing from the VC side. I&#8217;ve never had a few million to invest any way my little heart desires. I&#8217;ve only been on the other side of the table, where I&#8217;m sure the same world looks completely different. But from where I&#8217;m standing the opportunities seem fantastic - the problem might not be the market. Maybe VC has to (<em>GASP</em>) shift tactics in order take advantage of the current opportunities. Us folks you&#8217;ve been funding have been doing that for a while, I think the proper term for it is &#8220;business&#8221;. Take a step back, clear your mind of the millions of dollars at your disposal, and realize that you&#8217;re in business yourselves. You think you can spot innovation in the markets you&#8217;ve been investing in? Good. Cause you&#8217;re gonna have to start doing it in your own.</p>

<p>[8:23pm] waynesville: hmm no peerflix is different</p>

<p>[8:23pm] johnca: howso?</p>

<p>[8:23pm] waynesville: with mediachest you have to return DVDs. It&#8217;s like checking DVDs out of a library.</p>

<p>[8:24pm] waynesville: Only the &#8220;library&#8221; is someone else on the internet</p>

<p>[8:24pm] waynesville: whereas peerflix just moves a pool of DVDs around to whoever wants them</p>

<p>[8:25pm] waynesville: he&#8217;s talking about intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation</p>

<p>[8:26pm] waynesville: e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation</a></p>

<p>[8:27pm] NiallKennedy: when is the talk going to come back to smart agents?</p>

<p>[8:28pm] waynesville: The Chinese WILL figure out a way to control information flow.</p>

<p>[8:28pm] waynesville: Just watch.</p>

<p>[8:29pm] johnca: And then the Chinese will figure out how to circumvent that control. Neh?</p>

<p>[8:29pm] johnca: (and then control will be exerted again, etc.)</p>

<p>[8:30pm] johnca: or more seriously, what makes you think that battle will be &#8220;won&#8221; by those who wish to control?</p>

<p>[8:31pm] johnca: <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">http://sciencecommons.org/</a></p>

<p>[8:32pm] waynesville: I thought the Chinese would not be able to control information flow on the internet, but they&#8217;ve proven me wrong (so far).</p>

<p>[8:32pm] bobcat62 joined the chat room.</p>

<p>[8:32pm] waynesville: So now my expectation is they will continue to prove me wrong</p>

<p>[8:39pm] johnca left the chat room.</p>

<p>[8:49pm] waynesville: I get it now</p>

<p>[8:49pm] waynesville: I didn&#8217;t understand the question when he first asked but I get it now</p>

<p>[8:58pm] waynesville: Ahhh &#8211; &#8220;IF information can provide food and shelter&#8221;. That will never happen.</p>

<p>[9:00pm] johnca: people lived that way for millions of years, why not?</p>

<p>[9:00pm] waynesville: Because information != energy. Food is energy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry to chuck this here, but I&#8217;m on my way off to meet up with some folks and don&#8217;t have time to search out if this is a known issue or not.  It looks like the conditional get support in <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress 1.5.1</a> might be broken for some combinations of requests and maybe PHP versions. There&#8217;s this check in wp-blog-header.php:</p>

<blockquote><p>if ( ($client_last_modified &amp;&amp; $client_etag) ?</p>

<pre><code>            ((strtotime($client_last_modified) &gt;= strtotime($wp_last_modified)) &amp;&amp; ($client_etag == $wp_etag)) :
            ((strtotime($client_last_modified) &gt;= strtotime($wp_last_modified)) || ($client_etag == $wp_etag)) )
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The problem is when there&#8217;s no last modified header at all, so $client_last_modified is false, and we evaluate the second alternate of that conditional. For all the versions of PHP I&#8217;ve tried the strtotime() function treats false the same as &#8220;now&#8221; and returns the current time. Thus strtotime( false ) is always greater than the $wp_last_modified time. And I get odd responses like this:</p>

<p>hole:~ miker$</p>

<p>No state headers at all and a 304 return? No wonder people were telling me they were having trouble with the This is Mobility feed. Anyone else seeing that, or did I mess something up and not notice? I thought I had a clean 1.5.1 install, but I&#8217;ve been known to flail and then forget about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.500hats.com/sys-tmpl/door/">Dave McClure</a> and <a href="http://www.softtechvc.com/">Jeff Clavier</a> are putting together <a href="http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/05/introducing_ver.html">Vertical Leap, a vertical search conference</a>. The event is <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1680">being run through SDForum</a>.  And of course I just recently let my SDForum membership lapse because I haven&#8217;t been as interested in their events as I have been in the free stuff. If getting folks like Dave and Jeff involved is a general trend and not an isolated coincidence I&#8217;ll have to renew my membership.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=486">BayCHI put on a fantastic panel on search last month</a>, and there&#8217;s been a lot of interesting activity going on. Working at <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> has made me even more aware of search advances than I was before, and some of the services like <a href="http://jobs.feedster.com/">jobs.feedster.com</a> are exactly inline with what I expect the discussion to be about. Stuff like <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=503">structured blogging</a> and <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats">microformats</a> to enter into the conversation at some point. I&#8217;ve heard pretty good arguments on both sides of the explicit vs. implicit metadata debate. I guess I really don&#8217;t care which side wins out, or if it just ends up a draw. But <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/archives/2005/04/13/323">folks who would like to experiment with the stuff as normal users</a> don&#8217;t really have a way to, and I would like to be able to answer the questions Elle has without having to make crap up. Apparently the <a href="http://worcester.typepad.com/pc4media/2005/05/structured_blog.html">tools and services are going to start growing support soon</a>, I can&#8217;t wait to see what falls out. I really don&#8217;t want to have to implement a structured blogging parsing engine here at home, but I do have an editor window open already&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rafer is <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/05/may_future_salo.html">going to be the presenter at Future Salon this week</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Social media is delivering the dream of intelligent agent technology in an unexpected way. RSS, tagging, cameraphones, social networks, and a dozen other point technologies are ganging up to create the benefits we all expected from intelligent agents. Except &#8211; the intelligent agents turn out to be human beings going about our everyday lives, using dumb tools to publish meaningless snippets and anecdotes in machine-readable, sometimes open-standards forms. Each of us becomes the intelligent publisher of many different dumb agents, which we do very easily.</p></blockquote>

<p>Software applications all over the planet aggregate them in unexpected ways, providing online services of astonishing value at very little cost.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been going to the Future Salon events more and more often, they&#8217;ve been quite interesting. Even though I speak to Scott on pretty much a daily basis, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s going to have plenty to say that we&#8217;ve never touched on before. The <a href="http://www.syndicateconference.com">Syndicate Conference</a> is the two days just before the event, and I&#8217;m sure a bunch of new ideas are going to come out of that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A project long in the making is starting to get underway. <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com">This is Mobility</a> is starting to steal some of my attention. Just the time between 2 and 5am so far. I have a bunch of stuff queued already to go in there. Like more info from the <a href="http://www.tieturi.fi/koulutus/seminaarit/mobileenterprise/home.asp">Mobile Enterprise 2005 conf</a>, more info about <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.net">Mobile Monday</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,73651,00.html">Nokia Sensor</a> hackery and stats, info about the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,73,00.html">new phone models from Nokia</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/">W3C Mobile Web Initiative</a>, and the always popular Rants against The Man. However, I need at least an hour of sleep before I go to attempt to spend all of tomorrow programming again. It&#8217;ll have to wait till the trainride tomorrow :-) See you at the <a href="http://www.darknet.com/2005/05/citizens_media__1.html">Citizens Media party tonight</a>. Me, and Elle, and a shitload of coffee will be there.</p>

I might even print a few stills to keep in my pocket for a quick pick me up. Beats a daily affirmation by at least one air guitar and two ass slaps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> was trying to get an <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/events/">events blog</a> up and running using <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/">structured blogging</a>. We ran into a bunch of issues. Apparently Elle ran into Bob earlier this week, and Bob posted <a href="http://bobwyman.pubsub.com/main/2005/05/mary_hodder_poi.html">about the evolution of structured blogging</a>, so I want to chime in and admit my massive ignorance. I groove to the whole structured blogging concept, I like the idea of information spread about at the points of introduction but still indexed with structure. So these are questions for clarifications and not criticisms of the idea as a whole. Discussion, that&#8217;s what this is.</p>

<p>First off, I just don&#8217;t get how to do it yet given <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/wordpress/?page_id=13">the layout presented on the structured blogging site</a>. Say that I, Mike Rowehl, Feedster employee, would like to implement a parser for event data so that the Feedster site could present a calendar interface for upcoming events. There&#8217;s <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/download/x-subnode-processor.xsl">an XSLT example of a processor on the site</a>. This just isn&#8217;t clear at all. The script language is meant to act as a substitution language for an element in the enclosing HTML? I think someone went a bit off the deep end in terms implementation complexity. Why do we want the subnode content factored back into the enclosing HTML if the reason we factored it out in the first place was that we wanted strictly valid XML in an HTML document? Is the plan to process the subnode script if there&#8217;s an XML aware browser and let it style the content using CSS? If we have an aware browser why not just throw the semantic tags straight into the browser version of the markup and just note their namespace? Is it to keep from having to result to trickery when the XHTML usage of information happens in an attribute? A little clarification goes a long way, especially when there are few tools to experiment with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to assume that for an entry what I probably want is the subnode data for processing. I probably want <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/events/x-subnode-extract.xsl">something that extracts all the script snippets and strips the rest of the document</a> so that I&#8217;m working with valid XML at this point. Problem is, almost nothing out there claiming to be XHTML actually is. Lets assume that we can tidy up the XHTML, or just suck out the script snippets however, cause I don&#8217;t want to belabour the obvious point. The next issue is that Bob said that the content doesn&#8217;t have to validate. I&#8217;m getting this second hand from Elle, who&#8217;s telling me I&#8217;m an idiot over IM as she related the story, so I&#8217;m taking this with a grain of salt. There seems to be some kind of mismatch here. I think the statement was probably something more like the document as a whole doesn&#8217;t have to validate, as long as the stuff in the script tags is valid. I&#8217;m going to give Bob the benefit of the doubt and assume that&#8217;s what was meant. The problem is that <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/events/">Elle&#8217;s event blog</a> looks something like this if you view source:</p>

<blockquote><p><subnode xmlns:data-view="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/data-view#" data-view:interpreter="http://structuredblogging.org/subnode-to-rdf-interpreter.xsl" xmlns="http://www.structuredblogging.org/xmlns#subnode"><br />
<xml -structured-blog-entry xmlns="http://www.structuredblogging.org/xmlns"><br />
&#8230;&#8230;
</xml><br />
</subnode></p></blockquote>

<p>Looks like some kind of automatic validation rules misfiring. Now, if I&#8217;m wrong here I&#8217;m sorry, but I assume that the chunks of subnode data in that blog aren&#8217;t processable because something has split the element names at the first dash. Right? Why is the plugin on Elle&#8217;s blog doing that? I&#8217;m not quite sure, and I don&#8217;t really care for the purposes of this conversation. The issue is that the tools split semantics and representation and insert them individually. Since there are no tools to inspect that semantic information except the tools producing the information, Elle could have kept blissfully creating posts with &#8220;semantic info&#8221; in them if I hadn&#8217;t let her know what was up. And then only find out months later that there&#8217;s nothing parsable in all her posts. When you fork the presentation and semantic info, and the semantic version is hidden from view of the average user, you make it very hard for the system to self correct. If the semantic info is used for presentation the normal user can tell when the info isn&#8217;t correct, it doesn&#8217;t look right. So if this script tag based XML snippet format is the format we&#8217;re going to use there really needs to be some kind of validation available. Something that informs the user of the machine readable information that matches up to the viewable information. Not that they&#8217;re going to use that service mind you, but I think it&#8217;s the minimal necessary setup to keep this effort rolling along.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/05/feedsters_media.html">press release went out about the Feedster Media Network</a> today. It&#8217;s really cool to see an announcement about something I worked on out on the wire. Consulting work didn&#8217;t see that really happen at all. All in all the announcement is less exciting than the system going live and seeing the ads start appearing in the Slashdot feed. And not nearly as exciting as the system proving to be up to the task of serving traffic from a publisher with a reputation for commanding huge amounts of traffic. Kinda quaint to have a press release about a new media advertising system. I suppose somebody reads them though. In relation to the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=491">question I asked before about the role of press releases after a company starts blogging</a>, put down one tick mark on the &#8220;something issued after the discussion has been going on and a solid message has formed&#8221; side of the scorecard.</p>
