  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rafer is <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/05/may_future_salo.html">going to be the presenter at Future Salon this week</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Social media is delivering the dream of intelligent agent technology in an unexpected way. RSS, tagging, cameraphones, social networks, and a dozen other point technologies are ganging up to create the benefits we all expected from intelligent agents. Except &#8211; the intelligent agents turn out to be human beings going about our everyday lives, using dumb tools to publish meaningless snippets and anecdotes in machine-readable, sometimes open-standards forms. Each of us becomes the intelligent publisher of many different dumb agents, which we do very easily.</p></blockquote>

<p>Software applications all over the planet aggregate them in unexpected ways, providing online services of astonishing value at very little cost.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been going to the Future Salon events more and more often, they&#8217;ve been quite interesting. Even though I speak to Scott on pretty much a daily basis, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s going to have plenty to say that we&#8217;ve never touched on before. The <a href="http://www.syndicateconference.com">Syndicate Conference</a> is the two days just before the event, and I&#8217;m sure a bunch of new ideas are going to come out of that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A project long in the making is starting to get underway. <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com">This is Mobility</a> is starting to steal some of my attention. Just the time between 2 and 5am so far. I have a bunch of stuff queued already to go in there. Like more info from the <a href="http://www.tieturi.fi/koulutus/seminaarit/mobileenterprise/home.asp">Mobile Enterprise 2005 conf</a>, more info about <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.net">Mobile Monday</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,73651,00.html">Nokia Sensor</a> hackery and stats, info about the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,73,00.html">new phone models from Nokia</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/">W3C Mobile Web Initiative</a>, and the always popular Rants against The Man. However, I need at least an hour of sleep before I go to attempt to spend all of tomorrow programming again. It&#8217;ll have to wait till the trainride tomorrow :-) See you at the <a href="http://www.darknet.com/2005/05/citizens_media__1.html">Citizens Media party tonight</a>. Me, and Elle, and a shitload of coffee will be there.</p>

I might even print a few stills to keep in my pocket for a quick pick me up. Beats a daily affirmation by at least one air guitar and two ass slaps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> was trying to get an <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/events/">events blog</a> up and running using <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/">structured blogging</a>. We ran into a bunch of issues. Apparently Elle ran into Bob earlier this week, and Bob posted <a href="http://bobwyman.pubsub.com/main/2005/05/mary_hodder_poi.html">about the evolution of structured blogging</a>, so I want to chime in and admit my massive ignorance. I groove to the whole structured blogging concept, I like the idea of information spread about at the points of introduction but still indexed with structure. So these are questions for clarifications and not criticisms of the idea as a whole. Discussion, that&#8217;s what this is.</p>

<p>First off, I just don&#8217;t get how to do it yet given <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/wordpress/?page_id=13">the layout presented on the structured blogging site</a>. Say that I, Mike Rowehl, Feedster employee, would like to implement a parser for event data so that the Feedster site could present a calendar interface for upcoming events. There&#8217;s <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/download/x-subnode-processor.xsl">an XSLT example of a processor on the site</a>. This just isn&#8217;t clear at all. The script language is meant to act as a substitution language for an element in the enclosing HTML? I think someone went a bit off the deep end in terms implementation complexity. Why do we want the subnode content factored back into the enclosing HTML if the reason we factored it out in the first place was that we wanted strictly valid XML in an HTML document? Is the plan to process the subnode script if there&#8217;s an XML aware browser and let it style the content using CSS? If we have an aware browser why not just throw the semantic tags straight into the browser version of the markup and just note their namespace? Is it to keep from having to result to trickery when the XHTML usage of information happens in an attribute? A little clarification goes a long way, especially when there are few tools to experiment with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to assume that for an entry what I probably want is the subnode data for processing. I probably want <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/events/x-subnode-extract.xsl">something that extracts all the script snippets and strips the rest of the document</a> so that I&#8217;m working with valid XML at this point. Problem is, almost nothing out there claiming to be XHTML actually is. Lets assume that we can tidy up the XHTML, or just suck out the script snippets however, cause I don&#8217;t want to belabour the obvious point. The next issue is that Bob said that the content doesn&#8217;t have to validate. I&#8217;m getting this second hand from Elle, who&#8217;s telling me I&#8217;m an idiot over IM as she related the story, so I&#8217;m taking this with a grain of salt. There seems to be some kind of mismatch here. I think the statement was probably something more like the document as a whole doesn&#8217;t have to validate, as long as the stuff in the script tags is valid. I&#8217;m going to give Bob the benefit of the doubt and assume that&#8217;s what was meant. The problem is that <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/events/">Elle&#8217;s event blog</a> looks something like this if you view source:</p>

<blockquote><p><subnode xmlns:data-view="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/data-view#" data-view:interpreter="http://structuredblogging.org/subnode-to-rdf-interpreter.xsl" xmlns="http://www.structuredblogging.org/xmlns#subnode"><br />
<xml -structured-blog-entry xmlns="http://www.structuredblogging.org/xmlns"><br />
&#8230;&#8230;
</xml><br />
</subnode></p></blockquote>

<p>Looks like some kind of automatic validation rules misfiring. Now, if I&#8217;m wrong here I&#8217;m sorry, but I assume that the chunks of subnode data in that blog aren&#8217;t processable because something has split the element names at the first dash. Right? Why is the plugin on Elle&#8217;s blog doing that? I&#8217;m not quite sure, and I don&#8217;t really care for the purposes of this conversation. The issue is that the tools split semantics and representation and insert them individually. Since there are no tools to inspect that semantic information except the tools producing the information, Elle could have kept blissfully creating posts with &#8220;semantic info&#8221; in them if I hadn&#8217;t let her know what was up. And then only find out months later that there&#8217;s nothing parsable in all her posts. When you fork the presentation and semantic info, and the semantic version is hidden from view of the average user, you make it very hard for the system to self correct. If the semantic info is used for presentation the normal user can tell when the info isn&#8217;t correct, it doesn&#8217;t look right. So if this script tag based XML snippet format is the format we&#8217;re going to use there really needs to be some kind of validation available. Something that informs the user of the machine readable information that matches up to the viewable information. Not that they&#8217;re going to use that service mind you, but I think it&#8217;s the minimal necessary setup to keep this effort rolling along.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/05/feedsters_media.html">press release went out about the Feedster Media Network</a> today. It&#8217;s really cool to see an announcement about something I worked on out on the wire. Consulting work didn&#8217;t see that really happen at all. All in all the announcement is less exciting than the system going live and seeing the ads start appearing in the Slashdot feed. And not nearly as exciting as the system proving to be up to the task of serving traffic from a publisher with a reputation for commanding huge amounts of traffic. Kinda quaint to have a press release about a new media advertising system. I suppose somebody reads them though. In relation to the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=491">question I asked before about the role of press releases after a company starts blogging</a>, put down one tick mark on the &#8220;something issued after the discussion has been going on and a solid message has formed&#8221; side of the scorecard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Mobile Monday <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/">Marc Canter</a> came by to talk about identity systems, and in particular mentioned Infocard, an emerging something from Microsoft. Apparently an identity something. Kaliya has <a href="http://identitywoman.kaliyasblogs.net/archives/2005/05/momo_marc_cante.htm">some notes up</a>. I groove to everything that Marc said about what identity systems need to provide, how they should be open source based and open standards based, how they&#8217;re essential infrastructure, and how the systems should obey a core set of principles that has the interest of the user at heart. Nice I like it. And then he started talking about Infocard, because Infocard apparently provides all this stuff we want. This is the bit from Kaliya&#8217;s notes, and from what I remember she has it pretty well right:</p>

<blockquote><p>Back to Microsoft - if they are not participating in it doesn&#8217;t work it. Kim killed passport - this is the one you want trust (and thank for doing that.) They can be arrogant assholes - and Kim knows he needs help from the outside.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow that&#8217;s an odd statement coming from Canter. I spoke to Marc the most around the time when Elle and I were helping out with Ourmedia, and I remember him saying things like no one can tell us what to do with out media, we&#8217;re in control of the system we just need to make it work the way we want. I just assumed the same thing would apply to identity systems. I personally think they do. If Microsoft doesn&#8217;t participate they don&#8217;t participate, screw them. I&#8217;m personally not ready to say that Microsoft has control over the future direction of technology, especially technology I use. Hell, most of my professional life has been an attempt to prove that one does not need Microsoft to live online. If they want to participate, that&#8217;s okay. I don&#8217;t hate them forever. They just don&#8217;t have any good karma, and I&#8217;m certainly not ready to abdicate control  to them. And about Kim Cameron, great laws of identity! Well done, I like it. But am I going to trust and help Kim because he killed Passport? Ummmm, NO! You can&#8217;t set me on fire, and then extinguish me, and expect thanks.  Microsoft can&#8217;t attempt to screw me, and then hire someone to keep them from doing it, and expect my thanks. That&#8217;s not the way trust works, sorry.</p>

<p>But I really wanted to be constructive here. Cause I like Marc, and obviously he&#8217;s trying to help out Microsoft with this thing by helping out with the community. I think he called what he was doing a &#8220;sanity check&#8221; for the folks. So here&#8217;s the sanity check. Try a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=infocard&amp;btnG=Search">Google search for &#8220;infocard&#8221;</a>. And when you realize that doesn&#8217;t tell you anything about the technology itself, just what it&#8217;s supposed to do, try a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+infocard&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">search for
microsoft infocard&#8221;</a>.  Once you&#8217;re done getting no information there, how about <a href="http://search.microsoft.com/search/results.aspx?st=b&amp;na=88&amp;View=en-US&amp;qu=infocard">search at Microsoft.com for infocard</a>? Wow, this time we don&#8217;t even get useless results, we get nothing. So where&#8217;s the openness? Where&#8217;s the interaction with the community and transparency? And how can I find out about these great new technologies? I really don&#8217;t like being told what I have to use and why I have to use it, and then get no information about what it is under the covers. I get insulted when that happens, and it engenders the mistrust of a crooked marketing campaign.</p>

<p>Microsoft wants to play? Cool, welcome to the game, nice to have you. The game might be played a bit different than what you last remember. These days the game is about conversations, and trust is built through interaction directly with the people whom you desire to win trust from. I will not let you play the game with me if you tell me that you write the rules, so I might as well accept it. The game is pretty well structured to deal with that particular strategy these days, and practitioners usually loose. That&#8217;s my constructive bit of advice, it&#8217;s given once. After this time the advice gets a lot less constructive if you keep trying to tell me what choices I should be making without giving me information.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We ended up in business class instead of economy on the flight from Chicago to Stockholm on our way to the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.net/mm/summit2005/index.php">Mobile Monday Global Summit</a>. It&#8217;s like heaven in here. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/12835242/in/photostream/">Russ was really happy to have legroom</a> (he just <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008451.html">beat me to the punch with a post too</a>!). I&#8217;m playing with all the controls for the seats pulling out the trays and the TV built into the arm of the chair, and the game controller (the games aren&#8217;t great actually, I got bored in like 2 minutes). And there are outlets in the seats! I&#8217;m so ecstatic I can hardly breathe. And then Russ says &#8220;Hey, isn&#8217;t SAS the one that has inflight 802.11 service?&#8221; And sure enough, the one thing we haven&#8217;t pulled out and played with yet is the stuff in the pockets in the back of the seats in front of us, holds the best surprise. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/12835352/">SAS provides inflight 802.11 service</a>. So I&#8217;m currently somewhere over Canada writing this, and connected to IM and downloading my mail. How much ass does that kick? It&#8217;s hard to quantify exactly, but it <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/bbrep-SAS.png">does so at about 193kbps</a>. Of course overall ass kicking is a measure of speed x duration, so we&#8217;ll only be able to tell how much was kicked after we know how long it was kicked for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went out to hear <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1676&amp;mo=5&amp;yr=2005">Paul Graham speak last night</a> and after that we <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/archives/2005/05/04/338">gathered together some geeks to meet for dinner in Palo Alto</a>. At first it was going to be a small group, we thought maybe 5 or 6 people. But by the time we actually sat down <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/12449886/in/photostream/">there were 15 people at the table</a>.  Il Fornaio worked out quite well for the gathering. The space they gave us was actually big enough for 15 people. I hate when you go somewhere with a big group and they give you a table that you can barely stand around shoulder to shoulder. They were open late. And it was pretty cheap.  The bill split evenly came out to $17 per person, which isn&#8217;t much considering that most people had wine and there were a lot of entrees served. Some people had just desert or a cocktail, but still that&#8217;s pretty cheap for a group outing.</p>

<p>The talk by Paul Graham was very good. I got there late, and Elle and Niall had called to tell me they saved me a seat in the first row. As I was walking in Paul was up front talking and reading from a sheaf of notes. I thought to myself &#8220;Uhoh, if he&#8217;s just reading off some prepared speech I might get pretty bored.&#8221; And given that I can&#8217;t get a cell phone signal from up at the PARC building where the presentation was held and there&#8217;s no wifi onsite that can be really distracting for the people around me. Wasn&#8217;t an issue at all however. He was just using the notes as guidelines and telling some really amusing stories about his direct experiences. That was what really made it engaging I think, that it was about specific experiences that Paul had himself. Many of the points are pretty obvious when you abstract them out of the talk, like you should be concentrating on growing your business if you&#8217;re looking to be aquired because the condition of growing value makes you more attractive to potential suitors, and the best way to get in front of those potential suitors is to go in proposing partnerships and licensing deals. But there were a ton of bits and peices of practical tactics scattered around the overall strategy stuff. No way I&#8217;ll be able to get them all, but here&#8217;s a bunch that stood out for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When talking about planning to get bought at some point he said that license deals can actually be a liability in some cases. The person who aquires you or your technology isn&#8217;t going to look favorably on being tied to a license deal that requires them to let their competition use the technology as well. There are contrary examples, like Google licensing search to Yahoo and Altavista to prevent those companies from working on search on their own. But it is something to keep in mind while you&#8217;re out there shopping around.</p></li>
<li><p>He really encouraged getting an investment bank involved if your deal is big enough that it makes sense to do so. Under the standard structure they use they&#8217;re properly incented to make the deal in a way that&#8217;s really favorable to you when it&#8217;s favorable to them. They make the process much easier.</p></li>
<li><p>He stressed that potential aquireors aren&#8217;t really all that likely to steal your idea and make their own copy. It does happen, and he gave an example of a Japanese firm that stole their business plan and technology and setup their own shopping site. But in general things like that don&#8217;t really happen. The best way to protect against it is to keep some key factors of what your innovation is out of your discussions. You can give away a whole bunch without giving away everything essential to reproduce the system. If you think that copying is a real risk just figure out a few nonobvious areas in which to hold back some info.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important metric for most people evaluating the company is the number of users. Most aren&#8217;t well prepared to evaluate the technology itself, but they can observe the effects of a good implementation. It&#8217;s assumed that if you have crappy technology you won&#8217;t have many users and that if you do you should. So the best thing to do is to grow your customer base to prove that the technology is good, it&#8217;s better than trying to figure out how to describe why your tech is great. You can prove it quite easily by pointing to the group of existing users, which is more valuable to other areas of the business than a description of the technology anyway.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been quite a bit of buzz about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008442.html">Adam Curry starting a podcasting show on Sirius</a>. Doc <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2005/05/03#takingTheFork">picks up the thread</a> and says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Second, what Adam will be doing at Sirius, and what Howard Stern will be doing as well, is restoring radio to what it used to be, and should have been, all along. But it&#8217;s not podcasting. It&#8217;s new life for an old sphere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not going to argue that what Adam is doing in this case is broadcasting and not podcasting, but I have a completely different takeaway. Sure podcasting is a fundamentally different system than broadcasting was, and needs to be treated as something different if it&#8217;s going to progress. But I don&#8217;t see what Adam is doing as leveraging the new medium of podcasting to prop up radio. I think the radio folks might see it that way, and that&#8217;s why they put him on the air. I think what Adam is doing is introducing people to podcasting through a medium they already consume. He&#8217;s raising awareness for the medium and giving people a way to sample from it without a technical investment.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s hard for some of us technical people to understand, but let me lead you on a very quick romp through the progress of podcasting. At first there were some quick people who really groked the whole concept and built it, nod to Dave and Adam, with some really fast followers picking up on the casts and what they meant right away. But even among the technical folks there was a bit of hesitance. Some of them said &#8220;yea, interesting, but do I really want to listen to some guys just talking?&#8221; and &#8220;I would really rather read my information&#8221; and &#8220;sounds like just a whole lot more crap, just in a different encoding now&#8221;. But a lot of those folks came to the other side pretty quickly. Podcasting attracted great content, and the tools got better, and the word of mouth network and blogosphere spread the information necessary to get the right content in the right hands. Lots of the people who were hesitant tried it out anyway, and once they actually tried it they found out that they liked it. The influx of new users drove a new set of users, and it snowballed very quickly. It seems like it spread all over because it&#8217;s hit all the geeks and the media and info junkies. It hasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sitting on Caltrain on my way into San Francisco, traveling from Palo Alto up north. You don&#8217;t really find a more technically savvy area than the one I&#8217;m in. There are 26 people in this train car with me. I just asked all of them if they listen to podcasts or not. 5 of them said yes they did, 2 said that they know what they are but don&#8217;t really listen to any casts, and the rest all said something along the lines of &#8220;what&#8217;s podcasting?&#8221;. Now granted, for a new movement, to have 7 out of 26 random people aware of the medium is great. Kudos on the job done so far. But you know what, when I asked those people if they listen to radio, not a single one said &#8220;what&#8217;s radio?&#8221; People know what radio is, they know how to get it if there&#8217;s something there they&#8217;re interested in, and a lot already have the skills necessary and the vocabulary to understand it. That isn&#8217;t true for podcasting. Not yet at least. And if we are to make it so we need to engage in that most horrid of technical efforts, customer education. The word has spread like wildfire through the technical community because we have a distribution network for information that we actively go out and crawl, we seek out the info and try out new things. If podcasting is going to cross the proverbial chasm, there needs to be a way to get the folks on the other side aware of what the benefits are and how to get there. This isn&#8217;t my idea by the way, <a href="http://www.ericrice.com">Eric Rice</a> rants about this all the time. And he couldn&#8217;t possibly be more right. Podcasting is a cultural and social revolution, not a technical one. So technical hacks and tools aren&#8217;t really going to carry the medium to the capacity at which it becomes transformative on a global scale. It&#8217;s going to take cultural and social hacks instead. If you want podcasting to change the world, get out there and teach someone nontechnical how to get podcasts, teach someone without a technical background but with a great message how to create podcasts. I really think that&#8217;s the next step, and I think Adam is right on the mark with what he&#8217;s doing.</p>

<p>And just in case this should be misconstrued as hero worship, I actually don&#8217;t listen to the podcasts that Adam does. He&#8217;s just not my kind of audio. Not a problem, I&#8217;m sure if I were to do a podcast he wouldn&#8217;t really be interested in me either. So I&#8217;m speaking from the detached viewpoint of someone interested in podcasting and aware of what Adam has done from the technical side. I just really think this is the right move. And a radio person who groks the new medium is a perfect way to introduce the new to the existing listeners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>JD posted about <a href="http://www.darknet.com/2005/04/grassroots_medi.html">a grassroots media social gathering</a> on Friday May 13th at CNet in San Francisco. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/03/citizens_media_.html">invitation only citizens media strategy session</a> on the Saturday after, and a bunch of the folks attending that session are going to be at the gathering the night before. It&#8217;s going to be a pretty crazy week for me, but I&#8217;m going to try to make it out for Friday. What is citizens/grassroots media? Check out some of the articles from <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;limit=15&amp;q=%22citizen+media%22+OR+%22grassroots+media%22&amp;sort=date">this search</a>. It&#8217;s an evolving concept, so it&#8217;s hard to give a simple static definition. When I think of grassroots media I think of <a href="http://www.jluster.org/">Jonas Luster</a>, <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/">Dan Gillmor</a>, and <a href="http://jd.typepad.com/">JD Lasica</a>. And they do have different takes on what the whole movement means. So drop by on that Friday and find out what all the hubub is about straight from the source, there&#8217;s sure to be some interesting discussion and arguments.</p>
