  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html">article over at O&#8217;Reilly about mesh networking</a>. It covers the basics of what a mesh is, the kinds of networks which fall into that broad category, and then give instructions about using an existing open source project to form a mesh network using commodity parts and Linux. Very cool!! The article also points to <a href="http://wire.less.dk/wiki/index.php/MeshLinks">a wiki about mesh networking</a>, which has links to lots of other open projects and resources. For a project I was working on I did a decent amount of reading about <a href="http://www.intel.com/research/exploratory/heterogeneous.htm">using 802.11 networks along with sensor networks</a> to provide a dynamic mesh where just the simple sensors can&#8217;t do it. This fills in the blanks really well, as a few of these open mesh packages seem like they&#8217;re quite advanced systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/002504.html">article at SmartMobs</a> saying that there&#8217;s a Reclaim The Streets event planned for Valentines Day in San Francisco. This is an example of combination online and offline gathings of people, commonly referred to as a mob in some circles. People collaborate online, organize, and culminate in a physical meeting. I&#8217;ll leave it up to you to draw your own conclusions. For some more info about mobish activities there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/001571.html">a page full of links to stories from the middle of last year</a>. Mobs were big news a while ago, but I think that was just the flash of initial conception. They have been relatively quiet because people have been cooking up ideas and technologies I think.. and the real fun is yet to come. The events so far have mostly had the same social impact as those tricks you used to play in elementary school where everyone would drop their pencil at precisely 1:15. If you&#8217;re interested in the apps that could be coming, check out <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/book/index.html">Rheingold&#8217;s book SmartMobs</a>. Every once in a while I spout off about that stuff here too. (That was sarcasm by the way, I&#8217;m frequently haranguing just about anyone about the plight of mobile computing applications, and how businesses fail to realize the potential they have.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I connected to <a href="http://winksite.com/">WINKsite</a> this morning I noticed the <a href="http://winksite.com/boingboing/mobile">link to the mobile version of BoingBoing</a> in featured sites area. Woohoo!!! I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any secret that I&#8217;m a WINKsite fan, and I think almost everyone in Silicon Valley reads the standard edition of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>. It&#8217;s one of those sites that serves as a hub for bloggers, pulling articles in from all over which other people pick and choose from to mention in their own blogs. I&#8217;ve mentioned WINKsite before, but for those who might be new readers the brief recap:</p>

<p><a href="http://winksite.com">WINKsite</a> is a site which allows you to setup mobile websites. There are a bunch of functions you can setup in your site, arranged as modules you can turn on and off. When you sign up you get the url to your site, something like http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope, that you can use with a desktop system or from a mobile device like a cell phone or PDA. That&#8217;s one of the parts that I think rocks, that you can access the same content from both desktop and mobile. The desktop edition displays using an emulated phone interface so that you can see what it will look like on an actual device. There are two different major interfaces to your site. The first is the interface you see in the emulator or on an actual device, and then there&#8217;s the admin interface. If you login directly at WINKsite you can perform actions like turning on or off modules. Depending on the modules you have turned on and off the site can serve a number of different purposes. It could be just a simple set of bookmarks you want to keep for yourself, just a pure personal site. Or you could turn on the notes and guestbook functions and use it to communicate with a group of friends. WINKsite also provides more powerful publishing features, including a blogging interface and feed syndication, so that you can create a larger community site providing news and updates.</p>

<p>This is the kind of site that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> has setup, it&#8217;s a reformatted version of the feed from their site along with some community aspects like surveys, guestbook, and chat. I&#8217;m curious to see if the BoingBoing site ends up with a lot of draw, and how much the added features get used. I think they have the kind of readership that will really explore the use of new interaction patterns that a site like this allows. Okay, I admit it, I&#8217;m a geek. I&#8217;m interested in the experiment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MyPalmLife <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=258&amp;c=1">posted yesterday</a> that it got information that PalmOS 6 will include all the neat features that <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?c=1&amp;p=137">Russ and I were concerned about</a>. Is this conflicting information? Or when Palm says that OS6 is going to concentrate on PDA functions does that mean that they&#8217;re also going to improve networking also? It could be, maybe they consider networking a core PDA function. That makes sense wo me. I would agree. But I would certainly like some clarification on that one. Maybe this isn&#8217;t conflicting info, maybe it is. It could just be <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?c=1&amp;p=93">ambiguity in the terms PDA and smartphone</a>. If a smartphone is just a PDA with a cellular network interface built in, I would think that concentrating on PDA functions instead of smartphone functions would mean not paying much attention to that cell interface. But maybe Palm has definitions that don&#8217;t agree with mine. Maybe Palm considers smartphone functions things like MMS and SMS hookups, ringtones, and other enhanced handset features. There&#8217;s only one thing I can say confidently at this point: I have no idea what PalmSource is planning. And it doesn&#8217;t appear to be just me either. Russ sent along <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/4532.html">another great tidbit</a> about the European arm of palmOne considering alternatives to PalmOS. It would appear that this confusion over PalmOS may cover more than just the peons like me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell Beattie has an <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005881.html">interesting post in his blog</a> about PalmSource focusing PalmOS6 on PDA functions. I don&#8217;t think I could possibly agree with Russell any more than I do. I spent a decent amount of time thinking about it too, cause I do think that a limited function laptop is cool. For me at least, I can accept that what I want isn&#8217;t necessarily what others want. But because I think that the connected nature of the devices should be primary and the laptop features secondary, I don&#8217;t think that really counts as a disagreement. I was very happy when I thought that PalmOS6 was going to include features that would allow for easy syncronizaton of databases directly over a network using web services, and that the whole design of the OS was going to center around network usage. If PalmSource isn&#8217;t planning to do this, I agree that they really are missing the boat.</p>

<p>But that only starts out the issue for me. So what would happen if this is the case? What if the hardware manufacturer makes cool network enabled devices and the OS provider makes shit? Does someone else swoop in with an OS that runs on PalmOne hardware but does networking well? Is there any inherent connection between these companies any more? I was always a bit fuzzy still on what this seperation means. If it really means what I had assumed it would, that the hardware and software providers would be fully decoupled, it sounds like the time has come to get some other operating system in there to start filling in what appears to be a gaping hole. I keep forgetting that Handspring was snatched up by the hardware side, cause I was hoping  that the next generation of the OS would be helped by that acquisition. But if PalmOne and PalmSource are really two companies, there doesn&#8217;t have to be any Handspring effect on the OS. Bad news. Both of the bright spots which I was hoping pointed towards better network support in PalmOS6 (web service data syncronization and Handspring possitively affecting the development) might either be untrue or end up having no impact. And there really isn&#8217;t anything remaining. Hopefully the news is wrong. But if it isn&#8217;t, what happens?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Elle posted a <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/index.php?p=71&amp;c=1">pointer to some information about smartphone and handheld trends in Europe</a>. The information mentions the role of navigation packages, particularly GPS based services, in the increased adoption of devices. I would certainly like to get my hands on a device or two with geolocation capabilities. I think a few simple PDA apps to hook up to <a href="http://www.geourl.org/">GeoURL</a> or Atom/RSS feed software with mapping capability could spawn a couple of really interesting new usage patterns. I&#8217;ll have to keep my eye on some used Bluetooth GPS gear or something. I am personally of the opinion that geolocation services in one form or another are going to play a big role in mobile services in general, I think navigation systems are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend was downloading the <a href="http://www.phlak.org/modules/news/">PHLAK</a> ISOs the other day, so I decided to take a look over there today. I haven&#8217;t downloaded the CD images themselves, but I probably will. I have an HP that just refuses to run Linux in a stable manner. Maybe running most of it off CD will help. And the PHLAK site itself has some great news links. The <a href="http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/IntegrigyIntrotoSQLInjectionAttacks.pdf">Oracle paper on SQL injection attacks</a> and the <a href="http://homepages.ius.edu/adrian/z/">Zaurus tools page</a> are both great. This site could be a great general souce of security info if the community keeps going as strong as it seems to be. I&#8217;m off to download some ISOs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=130">Trusted Computing class this past weekend</a> Seth mentioned that he was engaged in some online sparring with someone who had a blog on <a href="http://invisiblog.com/">Invisiblog</a>. In particular he was talking about the <a href="http://invisiblog.com/1c801df4aee49232/">postings by someone calling themselves Unlimited Freedom</a>, which do make for interesting reading. I completely disagree with the stuff that Unlimited Freedom says, but in the interest of providing both sides of the story I felt I should at least link to the blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really more interested by the prospect of anonymous blogging, which has reawakened my interest in <a href="http://mixmaster.sourceforge.net/">Mixmaster</a>. Mixmaster is one of those projects that always pop up on the radar screen, I spend a day or two poking at, maybe use a few times and then forget about. Its anonymous remailer software with some pretty amazing functions, but in my opinion is a bit esoteric. There is some anonymous remailer info, but not all that much, and not all that much that targets the kinds of things that I normally have questions about. So if the interest keeps up this time, my next security post might just be about Mixmaster and anonymous remailers. I just stumbled across <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/">Cypherpunks Tonga</a>, a site which I also have been to a bunch of times before and then forgotten about. Which sparked a couple of other ideas about potential topics. And it also made me think that a resurrected version of the <a href="http://www.pasta.cs.uit.no/~perm/PASTA/pilot/software.html">PASTA Project crypto software for Palm OS</a> would be something that would scratch an itch I have, so I just might have to do it. A decent keyring project for the Palm with signing ability could make keysigning parties much more productive and easier to organize.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/pda/blue_dock.html">article over at MobileWhack</a> about a desktop cradle called the Blue Dock. It allows a PDA to be used like a full desktop system, with keyboard, monitor, and network connection. Still not available for quite some time, but it does work somewhat towards an idea that <a href="http://www.rohdesign.com/weblog/archives/000266.html">Mike Rohde was also talking about recently</a>. I&#8217;ve been following systems based on the MCC, such as the <a href="http://www.antelopetech.com/en/index.aspx">products from Antelope</a>, for a while now. The concept has been around the block a few times, and it would appear to me that the technology has been up to the task for a while. The iPod seems to be an excellent example of a compact system with almost all the trimmings necessary to serve as a computing core. But something has kept these little guys out of the mass market. They seem like a great idea to me, but I guess I could be in a very small minority who would go for a device like this. Perhaps once the wireless technologies have a little longer to ferment we&#8217;ll see something like the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1269604,00.asp">Personal Servers</a> that Intel has been working on instead. There&#8217;s <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5772921353.html">quite a bit of info about them available already</a>, and of course I&#8217;m quite happy that all those technologies seem to be Linux friendly (hell, the article is at LinuxDevices.com, how much better can it get?!?)</p>
