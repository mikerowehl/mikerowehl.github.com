  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jon Udell has <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/02/01.html#a905">a post about the two techniques used to reduce bandwidth when downloading feeds</a>. Those examples were pretty cool. I knew there was a header that could be used to check if a site had changed, but I never looked it up before. This is something I should add into <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">the OPE download tool</a>, presently called PalmTorrent. It would be really cool to have your apps setup so that you could update them online, the way that <a href="http://softwareupdate.sourceforge.net/">SoftwareUpdate</a> allows for, but running through the whole catalog to see what has been updated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/01/29/zaurus.html">An article from O&#8217;Reilly</a> talks about some open source PDA projects. It does bring up some pretty cool points which I hadn&#8217;t previously given all that much thought to, such as being able to move binaries around to different systems. That is a pretty kick ass point if you&#8217;re trying to create some open source tools. I&#8217;ve been working on a very early stage <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">project to get together some open source tools for Palm devices</a>. But that&#8217;s because I use a Palm device for day to day stuff. At some point I expect Linux devices to be perfect for day to day work, but still I prefer Palm devices for the PIM functions. I have tried out a few of the earlier Linux based PDAs, and I&#8217;ll probably end up with a Zarus at some point soon. For now however I have been fooling around with Palm apps. And coming back to do some Palm programming after having been away for almost 4 years is a pretty revealing. The Palm platform has grown quite a bit, as one would expect it to as it matured. But I don&#8217;t think it has scaled very well. There are a lot of platform parameters now (hardware that may or may not be present, screen resolutions, color capabilities, networking, operating system support, and so on). It has become a lot more like programming for any other operating system. It used to have an elegant simplicity, but in order to take advantage of these capabilities programs can no longer be simple. There is a lot that a programmer might have to take into consideration to ensure that their application works smoothly on all platforms, or in some cases to make sure that it works at all.</p>

<p>As the Palm platform moves towards more and more complexity it leaves room for complex systems to move in and grab some of its market. If programming for even the &#8220;simple&#8221; Palm interface means potentially having to deal with multiple screen resolutions, formats, and input methods why not just go all the way and program for an environment which has had these capabilities from the beginning? Especially if the system shares interfaces with a system that the programmer might already be familiar with. It makes the process of learning a new system much more bearable. Palm used to be the darling of the PDA world because of its simple yet powerful design. It did few things, but what it did it did well. What it could be extended to do was relatively limited, but actually extending it was also simple. This is not so any more. Could careful design of the system extensions have left them with a better system? I have no idea. Maybe they have done perfectly, and their system could be no simpler while retaining the functionality it has. That doesn&#8217;t change the fact that I can get a very capable Linux based PDA with more capabilities and which matches my development desires better. Still, I have a Palm now, and I&#8217;m a hacker, so I&#8217;ll program for it. But I&#8217;m keeping my eye out for a nice deal on one of the new Zarus models.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3436289.stm">an article at the BBC</a> with some interesting comments in general about open source. There is one section in particular that I think helps to summarize the case for open source in developing countries quite well:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you spend a dollar with a local company working on Linux, that dollar stays in your economy,&#8221; said Simon Phipps of Sun Microsystems.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;When you spend a dollar with a multi-national corporation as a license fee for a piece of software, that dollar leaves your country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about keeping the money in your local economy, developing skills and developing the local economy to be strong in its own right in a global context.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that is why some think open-source could be the way of the future, especially for developing countries.</p>

<p>I&#8221;m one of those people who thinks that open source is the way of the future especially for developing countries. The tech industry in the US was really pretty stupid for having put so many eggs in the Microsoft basket. And many of the consituents of that industry unfortunately still just don&#8221;t see any problem with the issue (as a sidenote, I think that many of the people I have worked with might actually be Microsoft developed marketing drone bots). It has been known to make life difficult for those looking to innovate. I would be very happy if the currently developing countries didn&#8217;t end up making the same kinds of mistakes. So maybe there is some use to Microsoft these days after all, it serves as a great scarecrow for developing countries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gordon Bell is <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1299&amp;mo=2&amp;yr=2004">going to be speaking in Palo Alto on Feb 19th at 7PM</a>. The topic seems to be a wonderfully geeky melange of old ideas with new implications and forward looking applications. I&#8217;m gonna have to watch Lain a few more times before I go to this one. Anything that feels it can invoke the name <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/bush.html">Vannevar Bush</a> without trying to joke about it is at least worth a look. Plus <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/gbell/">Gordon Bell</a> is no lightweight either. I would think it would be worthwhile to hear him speak, but that&#8217;s what I thought last month about <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=122">going to see Whitfield Diffie</a>, and I was really wrong about that. So this time I&#8217;m not going to make any speculations. I&#8217;m going to see the presentation and I hope it&#8217;s good. There will definitely be bloggage from me no matter what.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent a good part of the day today making some changes to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> in an attempt to make it more usable. The primary change is the addition of the markup menu to allow for easily inserting markup into the document. There are menu items that allow for inserting the begining or ending tags for underline, bold, emphasis, and italic. If you have text selected when you activate one of the items it will insert both begin and end tags around the selected text. This just seemed like the correct behavior, hopefully the users agree. There&#8217;s also an option to insert a link, which also can be used to surround a selection with markup. The link menu item pops up a form for filling in link details.</p>

<p>There are also a bunch of changes to try to make navigating within and between the forms quicker. Handling for the next and previous field shortcuts has been added. Most keyboard based devices have some dedicated combination for generating those events (on my Clie it happens to be Ctrl-p and Ctrl-o, I&#8217;m not sure what it is on other devices). I&#8217;ve also added menu bars to the popup forms. This is also so that shortcut access works. Now you should be able to do almost anything without having to take out your stylus. And if you don&#8217;t use a keyboard you still have some new shortcut options available.</p>

<p>This post is actually being prepared with version 1.8.  So if you see this text it probably means that the new version is being uploaded to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">the usual place</a> if it hasn&#8217;t appeared there already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Check out <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0401/30/lol.01.html">this gem of an interview with Darl McBride</a>. Talking about the quarter of a million dollar reward that he has put up for the capture of the MyDoom virus writer:</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, the way it works here, Miles, is to pay the reward out means that that person will be in jail. So I guess conceivably they could turn themselves in, go to jail, sit around with their $250,000 and get out. So I guess maybe that&#8217;s the way to make money. Since you can&#8217;t make money with Linux because it&#8217;s free, maybe that&#8217;s the new monetization system.</p></blockquote>

<p>I would hope that most of you out there have figured out just how off base this joke actually is. For most people it takes only a few seconds. But just in case I would like to say that it is possible to make money working with Linux. What Darl seems to be pissed about is that in the new age of computing one has to actually DO something in order to make money. The days of coming up with a single idea and then raping your customers with it over and over again seem to be passing. And in the absence of any discernible talent companies can no longer get by on just being huge. Most business owners are relatively happy about this, it should harbor in a whole new age of efficiency and radical new business models. It will be interesting, refreshingly new, engaging, challenging, and progressive. And this isn&#8217;t just radical communist talk either, or hollow futurism, or blind technological cheerleading. Joseph Schumpeter spoke about the forces of a free market which are both constructive and destructive. SCO happens to be on the destructive end of that cycle this time around. Rather than trying to shift their model to something which matches reality their President and CEO is lashing out like a schoolyard bully.</p>

<p>If I remember the stages of accepting death correctly, it goes something like : denial, anger, fear, hope, and finally acceptance. Sounds like Darl is experiencing anger at this point. Damn, that means there are probably 3 stages to go. I&#8217;m hoping that he wigs out and locks himself in a closet during the fear stage. Maybe if we can find ways to get <a href="http://www.funkyzilla.com/acatalog/Wind_Up_Clockwork_page_2.html">little wind up penguins</a> placed in his path all the time we can drive him over the edge. Like if he found them in his briefcase when he got to work, sitting on the hood of his car, handed to him by random strangers in the street. Not that I really wish the guy any harm, it&#8217;s just that his fanaticism and baseless propaganda and fearmongering remind me of the kinds of attitudes that get people burned at the stake for trying to explain that the world doesn&#8217;t work the way it was previously thought to. Not that I feel he&#8217;ll succeed in the long run, but he has the potential to do a lot of damage on his way down. Sorta like an infant playing with a pack of matches while sitting in a box of TNT. He doesn&#8217;t seem to be sure of what he&#8217;s doing, ignorant of the threat he poses to himself and others, capable of massive damage, and completely beyond control. Fortunately he seems to be destroying his company and his credibility in the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A recent string of articles and conversations have left me considering the tension between running a business and being a techno weenie. It&#8217;s a topic that other people have discussed before, but it&#8217;s something that probably has more general applicability than it seems to be given credit for. The point that really drove it home for me was <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/press/article/03405?pg=all">an article in strategy+business about what business strategists can learn from existential philosophers</a> (free registration required). The article touches on issues like how to carry out planning when it seems like more changes than remains the same from one iteration to the next.  If there are very few known (or even guessable) quantities, how can one form a realistic plan for action? Excellent points in general.</p>

<p>What I realized in reading it was that perhaps overall business planning is getting more like technical project planning. At almost every business I&#8217;ve been at in the last dozen years it was true that &#8220;change is the only constant&#8221;. Every day is a struggle to try to take in the new stuff that&#8217;s been going on out in the rest of the world, and still try to have the time to work on the project at hand in some meaningful way. It&#8217;s always been a delicate balancing act between following trends too closely and getting no work done, or ignoring the world at large and risking falling into obsolescence before the project even finishes. I used to think that this was partially a fault with the technical economy in general. I thought that the rate of innovation during the bubble was disproportionate to the real gains presented by the technologies. I figured once there weren&#8217;t lots of overfunded companies working daily to push the edge out further and further that the rate of change would calm down somewhat. I really missed the boat on that one, I admit it. If anything the rate of change has actually sped up, at least with respect to the types of technologies that I work with. There are lots of reasons why (latent talent with free time, reduced budgets forcing fierce competition, etc), but the important point is that this hyperactive rate of change isn&#8217;t something that seems to be an affliction of high tech, it just seems to have hit there early on. Now apparently it&#8217;s seeping out into other areas as well.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for the self-employed geek gun-for-hire? If you&#8217;re still in the game it probably means that you&#8217;ve learned innately how to deal with the issue of change. You&#8217;ve figured out how to balance between spending all your time reading about new Java technologies and actually getting that new server application up and running, or you&#8217;ve learned how to navigate the new Linux kernel releases that seem to come out every day and still maintain a working version for your company. The bad news is that the insanity is probably never going to stop, you are going to have to keep on your toes almost definitely (it&#8217;s one of the few things that does seem to be predictable). The good news is that the abilities you learned while finding the right stride in your technical work are talents that can now be reapplied to a broader base. As business in general gets to be less and less of finite science the more use there will be for those who understand surfing on the seas of change. We already understand the daily grind of looking at the definite output from test cases and dubious reports about the newest set of widgets which should solve every development problem automatically at the press of a button. Sitting on the fence between sales numbers and wildly varying market projections seems almost second nature.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the overall outlook however, and I want to spend just a bit more time talking about the application of these principles to the self employed consultant or independent entrepreneur. The first issue is not to be concerned with doing things &#8220;the right way&#8221;. Like the Perl programmers love to say, There&#8217;s More Than One Way To Do It. The right way always changes depending on where you happen to be standing and what direction you&#8217;re looking in. The important issue is to retain a somewhat clear vision of your direction. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you can ignore the markets all together, it just means there are almost an infinite number of paths to success. The details of how to go down each path are different, you will have to apply sound tactics, but in terms of picking out a strategy pick the one that makes the most sense TO YOU. After that you should find that applying the effort necessary to fulfill that strategy is much easier that trying to deliver on something which is at odds with your innate sense.</p>

<p>Once you figure out what that direction might be, make sure that you keep it in mind when planning what to do and how to do it. Chances are when you do technical work you don&#8217;t implement every single bit of technology just because you can. There isn&#8217;t a reason to build in Jini support for most web sites, although it technically could be done. The same kind of discrimination should be applied to non-technical issues as well. There are some things that just aren&#8217;t worth doing. Not because they&#8217;re inherently worthless, but because they don&#8217;t make sense given what you happen to be working on today. It might make sense tomorrow however, so you don&#8217;t get to write it off completely. This area of tension seems to be a constant, it&#8217;s always a struggle to filter out enough that you can avoid &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221; but not so much that you&#8217;re not reactive to changes. This is an issue that exists for every industry and companies of every size. I admit that I&#8217;ve only recently really explored many of the issues stemming from this duality. When I used to do mostly technical work I thought it was a problem that could be solved if someone somewhere would just take the time to figure it out. I believe more and more that this isn&#8217;t the case. However, I have learned from my experience, so I&#8217;m not going to be binary about this. I&#8217;m not going to say that solving the issue is impossible and that you have to just accept it. It just seems to be intractable today. ;-)</p>

<p>Paying attention to the overall package you&#8217;re offering is extremely important as well. I know the dot.com boom left a lot of us with a bad taste in our mouths when it comes to issues like marketing and branding. Innumerable tech companies with great presentation and no substance have given an unwarranted bad name to a lot of good ideas. But I think the concept of providing an overall experience rather than just a commodity service is more relevant than ever. Companies have no reason to pay a high consulting fee for someone to bang out some run of the mill PHP or shell code. That&#8217;s work that can be delivered just as well by someone with a smaller amount of niche experience or a narrow focus on a specific technology, for correspondingly lower wages. However there is still room for someone to bring their years of industry experience to bear on planning and integrating the proposed solution seamlessly into the overall business. It means not spending all your time sitting in front of the keyboard. It means more time talking about the projects you&#8217;ve done in the past and how they relate to the situation at hand, and what possible new issues there might be. In business terms this is called moving up the value chain. It&#8217;s a very basic principle from what I understand. And it implies is that if you do actually have a high value good/service then it doesn&#8217;t make sense to compete with someone else on price for a lower valued good or service. Simply move to a position where you&#8217;re better suited to take advantage of the high value skills you have. Some people give the guideline of moving as close as possible to &#8220;the place where value is created&#8221;. That&#8217;s a phrase that has helped me understand how it relates to what I do and how to judge it, so I&#8217;m passing it along. If after considering what those high value skills might be, you find that you don&#8217;t have any, you better get out there and get some pretty quick.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s my advice for myself for the day. TMTOWTDI, accept ambiguity and strive to do something in spite of it, and do pay attention to rounding out your overall philosophy about the way that you work and what exactly it is that you do. Now I&#8217;m off to do some of that aforementioned value creation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html">article over at O&#8217;Reilly about mesh networking</a>. It covers the basics of what a mesh is, the kinds of networks which fall into that broad category, and then give instructions about using an existing open source project to form a mesh network using commodity parts and Linux. Very cool!! The article also points to <a href="http://wire.less.dk/wiki/index.php/MeshLinks">a wiki about mesh networking</a>, which has links to lots of other open projects and resources. For a project I was working on I did a decent amount of reading about <a href="http://www.intel.com/research/exploratory/heterogeneous.htm">using 802.11 networks along with sensor networks</a> to provide a dynamic mesh where just the simple sensors can&#8217;t do it. This fills in the blanks really well, as a few of these open mesh packages seem like they&#8217;re quite advanced systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/002504.html">article at SmartMobs</a> saying that there&#8217;s a Reclaim The Streets event planned for Valentines Day in San Francisco. This is an example of combination online and offline gathings of people, commonly referred to as a mob in some circles. People collaborate online, organize, and culminate in a physical meeting. I&#8217;ll leave it up to you to draw your own conclusions. For some more info about mobish activities there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/001571.html">a page full of links to stories from the middle of last year</a>. Mobs were big news a while ago, but I think that was just the flash of initial conception. They have been relatively quiet because people have been cooking up ideas and technologies I think.. and the real fun is yet to come. The events so far have mostly had the same social impact as those tricks you used to play in elementary school where everyone would drop their pencil at precisely 1:15. If you&#8217;re interested in the apps that could be coming, check out <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/book/index.html">Rheingold&#8217;s book SmartMobs</a>. Every once in a while I spout off about that stuff here too. (That was sarcasm by the way, I&#8217;m frequently haranguing just about anyone about the plight of mobile computing applications, and how businesses fail to realize the potential they have.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I connected to <a href="http://winksite.com/">WINKsite</a> this morning I noticed the <a href="http://winksite.com/boingboing/mobile">link to the mobile version of BoingBoing</a> in featured sites area. Woohoo!!! I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any secret that I&#8217;m a WINKsite fan, and I think almost everyone in Silicon Valley reads the standard edition of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>. It&#8217;s one of those sites that serves as a hub for bloggers, pulling articles in from all over which other people pick and choose from to mention in their own blogs. I&#8217;ve mentioned WINKsite before, but for those who might be new readers the brief recap:</p>

<p><a href="http://winksite.com">WINKsite</a> is a site which allows you to setup mobile websites. There are a bunch of functions you can setup in your site, arranged as modules you can turn on and off. When you sign up you get the url to your site, something like http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope, that you can use with a desktop system or from a mobile device like a cell phone or PDA. That&#8217;s one of the parts that I think rocks, that you can access the same content from both desktop and mobile. The desktop edition displays using an emulated phone interface so that you can see what it will look like on an actual device. There are two different major interfaces to your site. The first is the interface you see in the emulator or on an actual device, and then there&#8217;s the admin interface. If you login directly at WINKsite you can perform actions like turning on or off modules. Depending on the modules you have turned on and off the site can serve a number of different purposes. It could be just a simple set of bookmarks you want to keep for yourself, just a pure personal site. Or you could turn on the notes and guestbook functions and use it to communicate with a group of friends. WINKsite also provides more powerful publishing features, including a blogging interface and feed syndication, so that you can create a larger community site providing news and updates.</p>

<p>This is the kind of site that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> has setup, it&#8217;s a reformatted version of the feed from their site along with some community aspects like surveys, guestbook, and chat. I&#8217;m curious to see if the BoingBoing site ends up with a lot of draw, and how much the added features get used. I think they have the kind of readership that will really explore the use of new interaction patterns that a site like this allows. Okay, I admit it, I&#8217;m a geek. I&#8217;m interested in the experiment.</p>
