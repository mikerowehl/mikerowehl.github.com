  <div class="entry-content"><p>A recent string of articles and conversations have left me considering the tension between running a business and being a techno weenie. It&#8217;s a topic that other people have discussed before, but it&#8217;s something that probably has more general applicability than it seems to be given credit for. The point that really drove it home for me was <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/press/article/03405?pg=all">an article in strategy+business about what business strategists can learn from existential philosophers</a> (free registration required). The article touches on issues like how to carry out planning when it seems like more changes than remains the same from one iteration to the next.  If there are very few known (or even guessable) quantities, how can one form a realistic plan for action? Excellent points in general.</p>

<p>What I realized in reading it was that perhaps overall business planning is getting more like technical project planning. At almost every business I&#8217;ve been at in the last dozen years it was true that &#8220;change is the only constant&#8221;. Every day is a struggle to try to take in the new stuff that&#8217;s been going on out in the rest of the world, and still try to have the time to work on the project at hand in some meaningful way. It&#8217;s always been a delicate balancing act between following trends too closely and getting no work done, or ignoring the world at large and risking falling into obsolescence before the project even finishes. I used to think that this was partially a fault with the technical economy in general. I thought that the rate of innovation during the bubble was disproportionate to the real gains presented by the technologies. I figured once there weren&#8217;t lots of overfunded companies working daily to push the edge out further and further that the rate of change would calm down somewhat. I really missed the boat on that one, I admit it. If anything the rate of change has actually sped up, at least with respect to the types of technologies that I work with. There are lots of reasons why (latent talent with free time, reduced budgets forcing fierce competition, etc), but the important point is that this hyperactive rate of change isn&#8217;t something that seems to be an affliction of high tech, it just seems to have hit there early on. Now apparently it&#8217;s seeping out into other areas as well.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for the self-employed geek gun-for-hire? If you&#8217;re still in the game it probably means that you&#8217;ve learned innately how to deal with the issue of change. You&#8217;ve figured out how to balance between spending all your time reading about new Java technologies and actually getting that new server application up and running, or you&#8217;ve learned how to navigate the new Linux kernel releases that seem to come out every day and still maintain a working version for your company. The bad news is that the insanity is probably never going to stop, you are going to have to keep on your toes almost definitely (it&#8217;s one of the few things that does seem to be predictable). The good news is that the abilities you learned while finding the right stride in your technical work are talents that can now be reapplied to a broader base. As business in general gets to be less and less of finite science the more use there will be for those who understand surfing on the seas of change. We already understand the daily grind of looking at the definite output from test cases and dubious reports about the newest set of widgets which should solve every development problem automatically at the press of a button. Sitting on the fence between sales numbers and wildly varying market projections seems almost second nature.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the overall outlook however, and I want to spend just a bit more time talking about the application of these principles to the self employed consultant or independent entrepreneur. The first issue is not to be concerned with doing things &#8220;the right way&#8221;. Like the Perl programmers love to say, There&#8217;s More Than One Way To Do It. The right way always changes depending on where you happen to be standing and what direction you&#8217;re looking in. The important issue is to retain a somewhat clear vision of your direction. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you can ignore the markets all together, it just means there are almost an infinite number of paths to success. The details of how to go down each path are different, you will have to apply sound tactics, but in terms of picking out a strategy pick the one that makes the most sense TO YOU. After that you should find that applying the effort necessary to fulfill that strategy is much easier that trying to deliver on something which is at odds with your innate sense.</p>

<p>Once you figure out what that direction might be, make sure that you keep it in mind when planning what to do and how to do it. Chances are when you do technical work you don&#8217;t implement every single bit of technology just because you can. There isn&#8217;t a reason to build in Jini support for most web sites, although it technically could be done. The same kind of discrimination should be applied to non-technical issues as well. There are some things that just aren&#8217;t worth doing. Not because they&#8217;re inherently worthless, but because they don&#8217;t make sense given what you happen to be working on today. It might make sense tomorrow however, so you don&#8217;t get to write it off completely. This area of tension seems to be a constant, it&#8217;s always a struggle to filter out enough that you can avoid &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221; but not so much that you&#8217;re not reactive to changes. This is an issue that exists for every industry and companies of every size. I admit that I&#8217;ve only recently really explored many of the issues stemming from this duality. When I used to do mostly technical work I thought it was a problem that could be solved if someone somewhere would just take the time to figure it out. I believe more and more that this isn&#8217;t the case. However, I have learned from my experience, so I&#8217;m not going to be binary about this. I&#8217;m not going to say that solving the issue is impossible and that you have to just accept it. It just seems to be intractable today. ;-)</p>

<p>Paying attention to the overall package you&#8217;re offering is extremely important as well. I know the dot.com boom left a lot of us with a bad taste in our mouths when it comes to issues like marketing and branding. Innumerable tech companies with great presentation and no substance have given an unwarranted bad name to a lot of good ideas. But I think the concept of providing an overall experience rather than just a commodity service is more relevant than ever. Companies have no reason to pay a high consulting fee for someone to bang out some run of the mill PHP or shell code. That&#8217;s work that can be delivered just as well by someone with a smaller amount of niche experience or a narrow focus on a specific technology, for correspondingly lower wages. However there is still room for someone to bring their years of industry experience to bear on planning and integrating the proposed solution seamlessly into the overall business. It means not spending all your time sitting in front of the keyboard. It means more time talking about the projects you&#8217;ve done in the past and how they relate to the situation at hand, and what possible new issues there might be. In business terms this is called moving up the value chain. It&#8217;s a very basic principle from what I understand. And it implies is that if you do actually have a high value good/service then it doesn&#8217;t make sense to compete with someone else on price for a lower valued good or service. Simply move to a position where you&#8217;re better suited to take advantage of the high value skills you have. Some people give the guideline of moving as close as possible to &#8220;the place where value is created&#8221;. That&#8217;s a phrase that has helped me understand how it relates to what I do and how to judge it, so I&#8217;m passing it along. If after considering what those high value skills might be, you find that you don&#8217;t have any, you better get out there and get some pretty quick.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s my advice for myself for the day. TMTOWTDI, accept ambiguity and strive to do something in spite of it, and do pay attention to rounding out your overall philosophy about the way that you work and what exactly it is that you do. Now I&#8217;m off to do some of that aforementioned value creation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html">article over at O&#8217;Reilly about mesh networking</a>. It covers the basics of what a mesh is, the kinds of networks which fall into that broad category, and then give instructions about using an existing open source project to form a mesh network using commodity parts and Linux. Very cool!! The article also points to <a href="http://wire.less.dk/wiki/index.php/MeshLinks">a wiki about mesh networking</a>, which has links to lots of other open projects and resources. For a project I was working on I did a decent amount of reading about <a href="http://www.intel.com/research/exploratory/heterogeneous.htm">using 802.11 networks along with sensor networks</a> to provide a dynamic mesh where just the simple sensors can&#8217;t do it. This fills in the blanks really well, as a few of these open mesh packages seem like they&#8217;re quite advanced systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/002504.html">article at SmartMobs</a> saying that there&#8217;s a Reclaim The Streets event planned for Valentines Day in San Francisco. This is an example of combination online and offline gathings of people, commonly referred to as a mob in some circles. People collaborate online, organize, and culminate in a physical meeting. I&#8217;ll leave it up to you to draw your own conclusions. For some more info about mobish activities there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/001571.html">a page full of links to stories from the middle of last year</a>. Mobs were big news a while ago, but I think that was just the flash of initial conception. They have been relatively quiet because people have been cooking up ideas and technologies I think.. and the real fun is yet to come. The events so far have mostly had the same social impact as those tricks you used to play in elementary school where everyone would drop their pencil at precisely 1:15. If you&#8217;re interested in the apps that could be coming, check out <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/book/index.html">Rheingold&#8217;s book SmartMobs</a>. Every once in a while I spout off about that stuff here too. (That was sarcasm by the way, I&#8217;m frequently haranguing just about anyone about the plight of mobile computing applications, and how businesses fail to realize the potential they have.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I connected to <a href="http://winksite.com/">WINKsite</a> this morning I noticed the <a href="http://winksite.com/boingboing/mobile">link to the mobile version of BoingBoing</a> in featured sites area. Woohoo!!! I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any secret that I&#8217;m a WINKsite fan, and I think almost everyone in Silicon Valley reads the standard edition of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>. It&#8217;s one of those sites that serves as a hub for bloggers, pulling articles in from all over which other people pick and choose from to mention in their own blogs. I&#8217;ve mentioned WINKsite before, but for those who might be new readers the brief recap:</p>

<p><a href="http://winksite.com">WINKsite</a> is a site which allows you to setup mobile websites. There are a bunch of functions you can setup in your site, arranged as modules you can turn on and off. When you sign up you get the url to your site, something like http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope, that you can use with a desktop system or from a mobile device like a cell phone or PDA. That&#8217;s one of the parts that I think rocks, that you can access the same content from both desktop and mobile. The desktop edition displays using an emulated phone interface so that you can see what it will look like on an actual device. There are two different major interfaces to your site. The first is the interface you see in the emulator or on an actual device, and then there&#8217;s the admin interface. If you login directly at WINKsite you can perform actions like turning on or off modules. Depending on the modules you have turned on and off the site can serve a number of different purposes. It could be just a simple set of bookmarks you want to keep for yourself, just a pure personal site. Or you could turn on the notes and guestbook functions and use it to communicate with a group of friends. WINKsite also provides more powerful publishing features, including a blogging interface and feed syndication, so that you can create a larger community site providing news and updates.</p>

<p>This is the kind of site that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> has setup, it&#8217;s a reformatted version of the feed from their site along with some community aspects like surveys, guestbook, and chat. I&#8217;m curious to see if the BoingBoing site ends up with a lot of draw, and how much the added features get used. I think they have the kind of readership that will really explore the use of new interaction patterns that a site like this allows. Okay, I admit it, I&#8217;m a geek. I&#8217;m interested in the experiment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MyPalmLife <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=258&amp;c=1">posted yesterday</a> that it got information that PalmOS 6 will include all the neat features that <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?c=1&amp;p=137">Russ and I were concerned about</a>. Is this conflicting information? Or when Palm says that OS6 is going to concentrate on PDA functions does that mean that they&#8217;re also going to improve networking also? It could be, maybe they consider networking a core PDA function. That makes sense wo me. I would agree. But I would certainly like some clarification on that one. Maybe this isn&#8217;t conflicting info, maybe it is. It could just be <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?c=1&amp;p=93">ambiguity in the terms PDA and smartphone</a>. If a smartphone is just a PDA with a cellular network interface built in, I would think that concentrating on PDA functions instead of smartphone functions would mean not paying much attention to that cell interface. But maybe Palm has definitions that don&#8217;t agree with mine. Maybe Palm considers smartphone functions things like MMS and SMS hookups, ringtones, and other enhanced handset features. There&#8217;s only one thing I can say confidently at this point: I have no idea what PalmSource is planning. And it doesn&#8217;t appear to be just me either. Russ sent along <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/4532.html">another great tidbit</a> about the European arm of palmOne considering alternatives to PalmOS. It would appear that this confusion over PalmOS may cover more than just the peons like me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell Beattie has an <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005881.html">interesting post in his blog</a> about PalmSource focusing PalmOS6 on PDA functions. I don&#8217;t think I could possibly agree with Russell any more than I do. I spent a decent amount of time thinking about it too, cause I do think that a limited function laptop is cool. For me at least, I can accept that what I want isn&#8217;t necessarily what others want. But because I think that the connected nature of the devices should be primary and the laptop features secondary, I don&#8217;t think that really counts as a disagreement. I was very happy when I thought that PalmOS6 was going to include features that would allow for easy syncronizaton of databases directly over a network using web services, and that the whole design of the OS was going to center around network usage. If PalmSource isn&#8217;t planning to do this, I agree that they really are missing the boat.</p>

<p>But that only starts out the issue for me. So what would happen if this is the case? What if the hardware manufacturer makes cool network enabled devices and the OS provider makes shit? Does someone else swoop in with an OS that runs on PalmOne hardware but does networking well? Is there any inherent connection between these companies any more? I was always a bit fuzzy still on what this seperation means. If it really means what I had assumed it would, that the hardware and software providers would be fully decoupled, it sounds like the time has come to get some other operating system in there to start filling in what appears to be a gaping hole. I keep forgetting that Handspring was snatched up by the hardware side, cause I was hoping  that the next generation of the OS would be helped by that acquisition. But if PalmOne and PalmSource are really two companies, there doesn&#8217;t have to be any Handspring effect on the OS. Bad news. Both of the bright spots which I was hoping pointed towards better network support in PalmOS6 (web service data syncronization and Handspring possitively affecting the development) might either be untrue or end up having no impact. And there really isn&#8217;t anything remaining. Hopefully the news is wrong. But if it isn&#8217;t, what happens?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Elle posted a <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/index.php?p=71&amp;c=1">pointer to some information about smartphone and handheld trends in Europe</a>. The information mentions the role of navigation packages, particularly GPS based services, in the increased adoption of devices. I would certainly like to get my hands on a device or two with geolocation capabilities. I think a few simple PDA apps to hook up to <a href="http://www.geourl.org/">GeoURL</a> or Atom/RSS feed software with mapping capability could spawn a couple of really interesting new usage patterns. I&#8217;ll have to keep my eye on some used Bluetooth GPS gear or something. I am personally of the opinion that geolocation services in one form or another are going to play a big role in mobile services in general, I think navigation systems are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

I haven&#8217;t downloaded the CD images themselves, but I probably will. I have an HP that just refuses to run Linux in a stable manner. Maybe running most of it off CD will help. And the PHLAK site itself has some great news links. The <a href="http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/IntegrigyIntrotoSQLInjectionAttacks.pdf">Oracle paper on SQL injection attacks</a> and the <a href="http://homepages.ius.edu/adrian/z/">Zaurus tools page</a> are both great. This site could be a great general souce of security info if the community keeps going as strong as it seems to be. I&#8217;m off to download some ISOs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=130">Trusted Computing class this past weekend</a> Seth mentioned that he was engaged in some online sparring with someone who had a blog on <a href="http://invisiblog.com/">Invisiblog</a>. In particular he was talking about the <a href="http://invisiblog.com/1c801df4aee49232/">postings by someone calling themselves Unlimited Freedom</a>, which do make for interesting reading. I completely disagree with the stuff that Unlimited Freedom says, but in the interest of providing both sides of the story I felt I should at least link to the blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really more interested by the prospect of anonymous blogging, which has reawakened my interest in <a href="http://mixmaster.sourceforge.net/">Mixmaster</a>. Mixmaster is one of those projects that always pop up on the radar screen, I spend a day or two poking at, maybe use a few times and then forget about. Its anonymous remailer software with some pretty amazing functions, but in my opinion is a bit esoteric. There is some anonymous remailer info, but not all that much, and not all that much that targets the kinds of things that I normally have questions about. So if the interest keeps up this time, my next security post might just be about Mixmaster and anonymous remailers. I just stumbled across <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/">Cypherpunks Tonga</a>, a site which I also have been to a bunch of times before and then forgotten about. Which sparked a couple of other ideas about potential topics. And it also made me think that a resurrected version of the <a href="http://www.pasta.cs.uit.no/~perm/PASTA/pilot/software.html">PASTA Project crypto software for Palm OS</a> would be something that would scratch an itch I have, so I just might have to do it. A decent keyring project for the Palm with signing ability could make keysigning parties much more productive and easier to organize.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to <a href="http://new.blogger.com/developers/2004_01_01_archive.pyra#107091563754937970">a post in the Blogger Developers Blog</a> Blogger now offers the Atom API and feeds. I haven&#8217;t yet tried them out, but you can bet that I&#8217;ll be working with them before the end of the day. The announcement includes a link to <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">AtomEnabled.org</a>, a site with what looks like lots of great resources related to the Atom API. So with that, I&#8217;m off to learn.</p>
