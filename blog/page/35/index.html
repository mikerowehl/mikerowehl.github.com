  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just re-reading a couple of articles by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.C.R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a>. They&#8217;re only <a href="http://memex.org/licklider.pdf">available as PDF</a> as far as I&#8217;ve seen, sorry about that. In particular the second article, &#8220;Computer as Communication Device&#8221;, really struck me as a discussion about <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/supernova/index.cgi?roundtable_closing_the_back_channel_loop">&#8220;the backchannel&#8221;</a> that appears commonly at technical conferences these days. Take a look at the section called &#8220;Face to face through a computer&#8221; and I think you&#8217;ll see that Licklider and Taylor are talking about much the same phenomenon as we witness today, except they were talking about it back in 1968. This is a quote from that section of the paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>So the meeting began much like any other meeting in the sense that there was an overall list of agenda and that each speaker had brought with him (figuratively in his briefcase but really within the computer) the material he would be talking about.</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>The computer system was a significant aid in exploring the depth and breadth of the material. More detailed information could be displayed when facts had to be pinpointed; more global information could be displayed to answer questions of relevance and interrelationship. A future version of this system will make it possible for each participant, on his own TV screen, to thumb through the speaker's files as the speaker talks--and thus check out incidental questions without interrupting the presentation for substantiation.
</code></pre>

<p>I think that&#8217;s just amazing. I&#8217;m sure someone has called out this connection before. But I couldn&#8217;t find mention of it anywhere so I&#8217;m posting it on my own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m playing the home edition of <a href="http://www.pulver.com/supernova/">Supernova 2004</a>. Listening to the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/supernova2004.html">audio streams</a>, watching the <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/supernova/index.cgi?supernova_wiki">Wiki</a> for updates, keeping an eye on the <a href="http://snblog.pulver.com/2004/">metablog</a>, and chatting on the IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. The term used to refer to dealing with all the incoming information is <a href="http://supernova.typepad.com/2004/2004/06/continuous_part.html">continuous partial attention</a>. I always think of one of the main characters from <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/idoru.asp">Idoru</a> when I try to describe it. Gibson is always so oddly apt in his characterizations. One of the characters is a researcher who can spot some kind of metapatterns in large amounts of raw data to pull out the information that he wants. It&#8217;s something like letting your eyes unfocus and just trying to spot anything changing in your entire field of view, except that you have multiple streams of input instead of a unified field to take into account. It&#8217;s an amusing exercise for anyone interested in computer interfaces. Apparently you can pass the information saturation point of an interface and still provide meaningful information if you split it into multiple channels that can be processed in parallel. Assuming whoever this information is aimed at can operate in &#8220;continuous partial attention mode&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inforgargoyle has a post about an <a href="http://igargoyle.com/archives/000423.html">ACLU Bust Card for Photographers</a>. The compact sheet of info contains information about what your rights are when taking photos, and what your rights are and how to respond if someone confronts you about it. I think it&#8217;s an excellent thing to have available, because I believe people&#8217;s right are infringed upon too often here in the US as of late. On the other hand I would like to point out that sometimes the best way to deal with the situation is simply being considerate. I go to lots of events where people are either taking pictures for a group website or photoblogging for their own site, and normally they end up asking if I mind if they take my picture. Simple common courtesy. Of course there are times when the other party does&#8217;t want you to take their picture, and asking them beforehand would ruin the benefit of the right to photograph has bestowed upon you. So, of course, if your mission is to make a statement about the ubiquity of surveillance and the non-uniform distribution of access to that ability, I won&#8217;t argue with that. I&#8217;m very happy that people are out there paying attention to that issue and doing what they can to draw attention to it and help out. But if you&#8217;re not in that extreme group, simply being polite is a great way to ensure that too much negative opinion isn&#8217;t directed at the wrong targets.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently I missed this when it went through the news, but <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype now has a Linux client</a>. In general I have a policy against running anything that I don&#8217;t have the source code for, but I might have to make an exception to try this out. I have a few friends who really enthusiastically recommended the service. Skype allows voice chat, which a bunch of other products do, but the geeks have been really into Skype because it&#8217;s built on some pretty hefty peer-to-peer technology. Apparently not only are the calls direct from one client to another, with the option of full encryption. But the user info is <a href="http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/000375.html">stored in a distributed index</a> as well. Sexy stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It appears that Yahoo has again <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=100235&amp;aid=978640&amp;group_id=235">changed something that causes third party apps to fail</a>. Now, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m unfamiliar with the trials and tribulations of trying to deploy a large scale application like this, I just don&#8217;t agree with their policies. Needing to change the underlying protocol is not a good way to control your application, it&#8217;s just evidence of poor planning and engineering. Of course, it also highlights some of the dangers of proprietary protocols. I have friends who normally I interact with using Yahoo. Bad me, cause now that Yahoo has decided to break from the API which my client was reverse engineered to work with, I can&#8217;t contact them. I&#8217;m not really happy about that, but unfortunately there&#8217;s not much that one can do. I use Jabber, but not all of the contacts I have are willing to switch. For them the official release always works, so why should they care if Yahoo wants to change the protocol? Well, just remember that there&#8217;s nothing that says Yahoo needs to keep doing that. Say they decide that they have lots of &#8220;value in their network&#8221;. Meaning they think if they decide to make Yahoo a pay-only service that people will cough up some money. Say they decide to do this to everyone, and not just the Gaim users. Take a little while to think about that. Me, I&#8217;m off to see how many other people are reevaluating Jabber and trying to see who else I can get to switch.</p>

<p>UPDATE (22:29 06/23/2004) : <a href="http://news.com.com/Yahoo+to+Trillian%3A+Talk+to+the+hand/2100-1032_3-5245821.html">here is a more official article about what happened</a>. Sounds like complete bullshit to me. I don&#8217;t see how closing off their protocol helps out keeping down spam. I have a counterpoint actually. When we needed to send notifications using Yahoo and AIM and MSN we first started by using a <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber server</a> with transports to handle all the different protocols. But of course, some transport was always broken, and it was a huge pain in the ass to try to maintain. So instead we ended up running a Windows box (the only one in the office actually) to run the three different apps and we send Windows events to the different clients to simulate a normal user clicking on stuff and typing messages. It looks like a completely 100% legitimate client to the IM services. Haven&#8217;t had any problems since. So there you go. If you&#8217;re looking to send spim, that&#8217;s the way to do it. Works much better than hacking Gaim or Trillian to send messages. I say this not cause I like spim, but because maybe if the spammers have a different way to send messages it&#8217;ll get Yahoo to develop a fucking clue. Real security has nothing to do with the obscurity of your protocols.</p>

<p>UPDATE (00:02 06/04/2004) : According to the work being done to reverse engineer the changes to the protocol, the server now sends an image recognition based challenge/response sequence (like websites that ask you to enter the letters in an image that&#8217;s had some obfuscation applied). Well, good for them. That should lock out the spammers for a few days. Me, I&#8217;ve decided the service isn&#8217;t worth it. It means I might lose the ability to communicate with a few people who aren&#8217;t willing to make the switch, but I guess that&#8217;s just the price I have to pay. Apparently the price of freedom isn&#8217;t only eternal vigilance, but eternal vigilance plus a couple of entries from my buddy list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/004233.htm">post over at Textually.org</a> pointing to a <a href="http://enorgis.com/mor20040619.htm#BlogID3559">summary from the Nokia Connection press conference</a>. Some interesting insights in there. I&#8217;m not a Nokia user, but I&#8217;ve heard so many good opinions of their phones that I&#8217;ve been planning to try one out. In particular, developers seem to like the platform for all the right reasons. In particular, the <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/programming/perl/perl_on_nokia.html">news about either Perl or Python being available</a> really caught my attention. Here&#8217;s a company that seemed to be serving the community best by providing relatively open platforms upon which developers could innovate. Unfortunately they seem to have lost the advantage that once put them at the front of the market.</p>

<p>The question I ask myself is &#8220;what lessons are other manufacturers taking away from this?&#8221; Hopefully they&#8217;re not saying to themselves &#8220;well, we won&#8217;t make the mistake of dicking around with a bunch of open source languages like Nokia did&#8221; I think it&#8217;s very important to keep the spirit of those efforts alive. I hope that the trouble that Nokia is currently having doesn&#8217;t end up shedding a poor light on the experimental projects that have been going on. I&#8217;m irrationally really hoping that Nokia manages to pull out a turnaround soon. I&#8217;ve never used their tools or experimented with their handsets. Yet still, I would like to get a chance to play with their toys before they disappear :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Panel on Funding Your Dream</strong></p>

<p>Participants</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(Moderator) Mohanjit Jolly - Garage Technology Ventures</p></li>
<li><p>Steve Baloff (Steve B herein)- Advanced Technology Ventures</p></li>
<li><p>Bill Green - VantagePoint Venture Partners</p></li>
<li><p>Martin Kuhn - Sony</p></li>
<li><p>Steve Jurvetson (Steve J herein)- Draper Fisher Jurvetson</p></li>
<li><p>Ian Sobieski - The Band of Angels</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Q - What is the process to connect with your firm?</p>

<p>Steve B.- If you don&#8217;t know people within the community you should be able find a referral.</p>

<p>Bill - There is a huge amount of info that goes through the VCs, you need to be able to win the &#8220;30 second beauty contest&#8221;. Try to do something to differentiate yourself.</p>

<p>Martin - Many times their firm is the one initiating contact with a business. If you have something interesting within electronics, just mail him.</p>

<p>Steve J. - They look at as much as they can, they would like to see even more. They drag the net through the pool to see what they can find. Gives them a good meta-view, how many companies there are in certain areas. You need a concise and direct pitch to appeal to him, otherwise there just isn&#8217;t time to review it all.</p>

<p>Ian - They screen through unsolicited stuff, but normally it&#8217;s through a referral. The person who makes the referral often serves as an internal advocate.</p>

<p>Summary by Jolly - You have to compete for attention, tap your network.</p>

<p>Q - You need money to make your company interesting. How would a first timer start up and make themselves interesting?</p>

<p>Steve J - Software is something you can start without capital, but most everything else needs to be built out or bootstrapped in some way. You can build a great team to appeal to investors, if you can. Bootstrap is great if you can do it, but doesn&#8217;t fit all industries.</p>

<p>Steve B - Looks for the team, is this person able to put together a team willing to follow the vision?</p>

<p>Ian - There&#8217;s a lot to be said for building a career as an entrepreneur. You don&#8217;t have to knock it out of the park the first time. If you&#8217;re in the game, people are more likely to bet on you down the line.</p>

<p>Q - Is an idea good enough, or do you need a prototype?</p>

<p>Martin - depends on the business unit on Sony. Has helped very bare and unexperienced teams find people within Sony to get up and going.</p>

<p>Q - Being a large fund, how do you fund seed stage?</p>

<p>Bill - The partners have some freedom to deal with situations like that. They might be provided with small pools of money they can make seed investments with, but of course they&#8217;re going to invest in ideas that they can then invest a lot more in relatively soon.</p>

<p>Steve B - its more about the time than the money. If someone tells you they&#8217;re funding a lot of seed, they can&#8217;t be spending lots of time with each. If you need lots of attention, the person making lots of small deals might not be the person for you.</p>

<p>Q - How you you pick companies if the market they&#8217;re in isn&#8217;t formed yet?</p>

<p>Ian - That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called venture. You just do the best you can, and maybe hope you&#8217;re lucky.</p>

<p>Steve J - The big danger for them today seems to be being too early. Lots of areas everyone knows will be big, but there&#8217;s no agreement over when it&#8217;ll be big.</p>

<p>Q - Whats a pet peev?</p>

<p>Martin - Be short and concise, what is the technology.</p>

<p>Steve B - entrepreneurs don&#8217;t follow through, qualify who your leads are,what are they looking for. You should be in a selling mode, you need to close the VC.</p>

<p>Bill - Figure out what is the preferred method and volume of communication. VCs have limited bandwidth.</p>

<p>Steve J - There needs to be a willingness to follow a nonlinear conversation. Unwillingness to diverge from the script send a signal of inflexibility and lack of confidence.</p>

<p>Ian - Issues writing the deal terms are annoying. Its hard to make money in an area where 9 out of 10 fail. You really have to make it up in the one that works, and investors need to make their money.</p>

<p>Q from audience - should you go to funds that funded competitors if you think you have the better technology?</p>

<p>Steve J - Go to someone else, most VCs don&#8217;t like to invest in companies that are too closely related (otherwise they might not know where to hand off contacts or resumes).</p>

<p><strong>The Art of Bootstrapping - Bill Reichert - Garage Technology Ventures</strong></p>

<p>Talking before the session, Bill said send him tips about starting up bootstrapping if you have them. His email address isreichert at garage dot com. They&#8217;re looking for resourceful entrepreneurs who can do more with less, who can stretch a dollar. Send in your ideas and Bill will share them with the community.</p>

<p>There are different models - garage, university, service to product (start out as consulting and develops a productized offering), core customer/partner (build a technology for a big partner and keep the rights).</p>

<p>Characteristics for success - low capital requirements, low cost of customer acquisition, rapid cash flow and cash up front, recurring revenue.</p>

<p>Alternate sources to financing - day job, credit cards and mortgage, 3F (friends, family, fools), founding angel, government grants, incubator, license rights (sell to someone servicing a market you&#8217;re willing to give away, ie the Japanese market if you&#8217;re in the US), core customer (develop on someone elses dime and keep the IP), version 1.0 (there is no better financing source than customers).</p>

<p>Bootstrap economics - its all about payback not ROI. 2 dollars today is better than 3 dollars in a year. Pick the minimal set of features, marketing and promotions is going to have to be at the right level, sales expenses have to be kept down, overhead minimal.</p>

<p>Product development, how do we minimize it? Keep your day job and work nights and weekends, use PhD students looking for dissertations, tap offshore resources, productize a consulting project/NRE (nonrecurring engineering), license a finished product (NOTE from author: or use open source!!), import a finished product. Get your product to market fast.</p>

<p>Bootstrap selling, frequently overlooked. Doesn&#8217;t fit into accounting well, there is no established business process to measure it. Rifle shot selling (make sure you know your first ten customers. This is hand to hand combat, be prepare to get bruised), community selling and viral marketing (find groups with strong word of mouth references, they will help you sell), channel sales, OEM partnerships/private label (people who would embed what you have in their existing offerings), Internet, consulting.</p>

<p>Bootstrap marketing - PR, events/seminars/webinars, directories, analysts, affiliate marketing programs, AdWords (some people are getting fantastic payback using this). Normally there is a company out there doing market development, explaining what a new segment is. Piggyback on that messaging.</p>

<p>Recruiting - networks of friends and advisers, university, pilfer from competitors, contract recruiters, NOT Monster, nurture &#8220;talent in waiting&#8221;.</p>

<p>Operations - do the core, outsource the rest. Leverage the skills in your ecosystem.</p>

<p>Questions to determine if your company should be bootstrapped:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is the model bootstrapable</p></li>
<li><p>do you have the discipline</p></li>
<li><p>access to leveragable resources</p></li>
<li><p>if raising venture is just too painful</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When you no longer need money, the desperation is out of your eyes, they&#8217;re more likely to give you money.</p>

<p><strong>Panel Been There, Done That</strong></p>

<p>Panel of experienced entrepreneurs</p>

<p>Participants:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(Moderator) Guy Kawasaki - Garage Technology Ventures</p></li>
<li><p>Julie Hanna Farris - Scalix</p></li>
<li><p>Richard Mandeberg - Mirra</p></li>
<li><p>Michael O&#8217;Donnell - BitPass</p></li>
<li><p>Steve Poizner - Candidate for CA State Assembly</p></li>
<li><p>Peter Thiel - Clarium Capital Management</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Q - explain your current opinion of the startup environment</p>

<p>Peter - think about landing your company, not just launching it. During the bubble it was easy to get funding, but there was more competition. Back then you needed money to overcome that competition. Today you can&#8217;t get much money, but perhaps you don&#8217;t need it.</p>

<p>Steve - In this area geographically (the San Francisco Bay Area that is) there are a few factors that need to be overcome. Some VCs think that California is a hostile business environment, so they send money elsewhere. That needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>Mike - Its difficult to break into the closed environment of VC. You need to find someone to help you make connections (Garage or someone else). VCs have returned to some discipline (metrics didn&#8217;t exist during the bubble, they&#8217;re back).</p>

<p>Richard - Its all about doing more with less capital. One thing you do get in the Valley is a community that is sympathetic to the challenges and brings a pool of experience.</p>

<p>Julie - We might be in a minibubble. There might be lots of people out there irrationally thinking they can pull off another bubble. Asked if its hard to get funding as a woman, says that there is a VC protocol that most women don&#8217;t have work experience that has prepared them for. So it could be hard, but not &#8220;cause they&#8217;re a woman&#8221;, its cause they don&#8217;t often have the right background.</p>

<p>Q - What is the one major factor for success?</p>

<p>Steve - make sure it works, all the issues all the corner cases.</p>

<p>Mike - Money, &#8220;cash is more important than your mother&#8221;.</p>

<p>Richard - theres a difference in understanding what the one thing for you is, and then the one thing for the company. For the company, he thinks the company needs to stay focused, and never deviate.</p>

<p>Julie - Knowing what the one thing is that you do better than everyone on the planet, know your domain.</p>

<p>Peter - People are the most important. Although he agrees with the other comments, he thinks there are too many unknowns to try for anything else.</p>

<p>Guy says make your founders vest, so you don&#8217;t lose them if the team hits trouble.</p>

<p>Q - What is one of the dumbest thing you&#8217;ve done as a CEO?</p>

<p>Mike - overpromising and underdelivering. You work really hard and just miss your goals, you feel like crap, the VCs are pissed off. Try to set reasonable targets. The CEO should not do the forecasting, they need to be too optimistic.</p>

<p>Richard - bringing an investor into a company because he was intrigued with their worldview, someone who wanted to take the company in another direction.</p>

<p>Julie - Learned it always costs more and takes longer, learned because of not tempering optimism. If you don&#8217;t hit your milestones you feel bad even if you did great work. Deal with problems early and often. Set your goals some place where you have a high confidence level of being able to hit it (says set the goal at a place where you have 100 confidence).</p>

<p>Mike added forecast initially at the 100 percent confidence level and manage your cash to that, but also make an upside prediction taking into account the unknowns.</p>

<p>Peter - don&#8217;t hire consultants for core functions.</p>

<p>Steve - Getting the right people at the right time. They engaged in a test of Marines vs Snaptrack in terms of tracking technology, and they ended up with an out of shape engineer vs a young marine, and just looked weird. Says they also didn&#8217;t pay enough attention to intellectual property issues.</p>

<p><strong>The Art of Rain Making - Bill Joos - Garage Technology Ventures</strong></p>

<p>Guy made a funny comment between sessions. Guys law: to calculate valuation of a prefunding company, for each full time engineer add one million, for each MBA you subtract 250 thousand. :-)</p>

<p>The session:</p>

<p>Let a hundred flowers blossom. Where are things growing? They might not be the places you expect, and be receptive to that. Get version 1 out and pay attention.</p>

<p>Find your fulcrums, its all about leverage. Get taken in (who does your customer already have a relationship with? who should be your new best friends?), get referred in (current customers, board of directors/advisers), endorsements (who is your &#8220;American Dental Association&#8221;), who besides you has a vested interest in your success?, always be on the lookout for out-of-the-box fulcrums. Fulcrums outside the expected areas.</p>

<p>Go after agnostics, not atheists. You want an agnostic who knows they have a problem. An additive sale is a magnitude easier than a displacement sale. Bill Joos law: it&#8217;s not enough to build a better mousetrap, you have to find people passionate about killing mice.</p>

<p>Who are the influencers? Stop, look, and listen.</p>

<p>Make the first steps easy. Test drive or free trial (&#8220;take the puppy dog home, and if you don&#8217;t want it bring it back&#8221; - everyone keeps the dog), don&#8217;t underestimate switching costs, get a small piece before the whole pie, if the roles were reversed what would you want?</p>

<p>Use the right lead generation techniques. Small scale seminars (create a gathering at your podium, of attend someone elses), get published (find a publication or write a whitepaper), proactive networking (the exact opposite of cold calling, give and take,whats in it for your network), participate in industry events (both yours and your customers)</p>

<p>Question everything. Hearing is not listening. Become an active and intelligent listener. Listen with a pen. Develop a healthy curiosity. Listen to what is not said. They&#8217;ll tell you what it takes to close the deal if you ask the right questions.</p>

<p>There are huge benefits to benefits. Features suck, benefits rock. When you make statements make sure you provide a framework for understanding that statement. Make sure that your customer isn&#8217;t saying &#8220;so what&#8221;. When talking about features make sure you explain the benefit. (Feature, benefit, reaction)</p>

<p>Objections. Learn to love objections. Objections are the path to solving pain. Usually the wrong objection answered, peel the objection onion. The real objection is normally 2 or 3 layers down. Verify and clarify. Take objections and make them objectives. Use references (&#8220;feel, felt, found&#8221;).</p>

<p>Selling is a process, not an event. It is an attitude, all sales all the time.</p>

<time datetime="2004-06-19T04:31:27-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 19<span>th</span>, 2004</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve cleaned up my notes from the other day, both to ensure that I&#8217;ve reread all of them to refresh my memory, and to clarify some vague points and correct some mistakes. Two big posts this time, hope that works out for the rest of you.</p>

<p><strong>Session 1 - The Art of the Start by Guy Kawasaki</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Art of the Start&#8221; is the name of his new book, available soon. BUY ONE!!</p>

<p>People came in from out of the country (lots of people from Canada).</p>

<p>He commented that the cover of his book is a stock photo from an online service. He paid something ridiculous like $1.50 for it, and commented that it could have been snatched up by anyone else.</p>

<p>He said normally he likes to use the top ten format. It gives the audience an idea of how long he&#8217;s going to be around. And if your presentation sucks, it gives the audience an idea of how long you&#8217;ll suck for. But he has a top 5 this time, there aren&#8217;t ten principles for starting.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make meaning : not money, money is an outcome of making meaning (preserve something good, right a wrong, etc). During his Apple stint he didn&#8217;t hold to this principle, but he&#8217;s learned it over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Make mantra : simpler than a mission statement. So that if you ask anyone what the company does, they know IMMEDIATELY. Group design of the mission statement sucks, it ends up just being a flimsy wordy statement that no one remembers. Everyone uses the same kind of words. Not worth it for a small company, make a mantra. Example mantras for some companies: Disney = fun family entertainment; Nike = authentic athletic experience</p></li>
<li><p>Get going : the key is not slides and word, it&#8217;s actually getting going. Think Big. Think 10x better, think creating a new curve. Jump to a completely new curve. Find soulmates. There is a myth around sole entrepreneur. You should want to polarize people, the worst thing you can experience is indifference. You want people to either love it or hate it. Design different. Examples of alternate guiding principles to keep in mind are &#8220;I want one&#8221;, &#8220;My employer couldn&#8217;t/wouldn&#8217;t&#8221;, &#8220;What the hell, it&#8217;s possible, lets build it&#8221; (like Motorola with cell phones), &#8220;There must be a better way&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a business model : Guy joked that perhaps more than anyone else, he wants just one more bubble. This time he knows just what to do. But if that bubble doesn&#8217;t appear you need a business model. The questions that you should be addressing : &#8220;Who has you money in their pocket, and how do you get it?&#8221;. Have a very exact and simple plan. Copy someone else&#8217;s model. Ask women what they think about your business model. Men have killing coded into their DNA, and when asked about your business plan men will always say it sounds good. If they really think its a bad idea, they see it as a great way to kill the competition.</p></li>
<li><p>Weave a MAT : starting a company is very much like a blasting site, the MAT keeps debris in. M = Milestones (proof of concept, complete design, prototype, ship testable version). A= Assumptions (test your assumptions in realtime, performance of product, test market size, how many sales call can a person make, what is the conversion rate, how may support calls does the average user generate, prices of parts and supplies). T = Tasks (major tasks necessary to hit milestones, renting office space, find key vendors, payroll, legal docs, insurance policies).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>That is the art of the start.</p>

<p><strong>Session 2 - Panel on Creating an Ecosystem</strong></p>

<p>Participants:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(Moderator) Guy Kawasaki - Garage Technology Ventures</p></li>
<li><p>Jeff Adams - Goldman Sachs</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Anderson - Mohler, Nixon, and Williams</p></li>
<li><p>Alan Jepsen - Comerica</p></li>
<li><p>Betty Taylor - Krause Taylor Associates</p></li>
<li><p>Mark Weeks - Heller Ehrman/Venture Law Group</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Q - What is your impression of the current atmosphere for entrepreneurs?</p>

<p>Mark - not expecting another bubble, but the startup environment is great, there are lots of exciting ideas and people around these days. His suggestion is to become crisp and to the point if you want to succeed.</p>

<p>Betty - Current atmosphere resembles 1998, there is a lot of progress based on where things were 2 years ago. Lots more seasoned management, and they&#8217;ve defined goals well. Google brought in good management, others are doing similar.</p>

<p>Alan - no bubble any time soon. Entrepreneurs see problems out there still, but don&#8217;t have money to go after it. It ends up being frustrating both for the businesses and for investors.Thinks the bubble will never return (not in his lifetime).</p>

<p>Dave - people are using less to do more. Value for the dollar. Look at credentials of services firms to make sure you&#8221;re getting what you need.</p>

<p>Jeff - This is a great time, opportunity for people to open their wallets is getting better. Lots of talent to draw from. Great pool to form a company. IPO market is healthy, so that means a better liquidity path. Minimum configuration for a startup - something that people can be passionate about, good size, profitable for year, seasoned management, financial controls (big emphasis on that).</p>

<p>Mark says we should differentiate the early stage startup from later stage. The early startup does not need experience, they need passion. At the early stage you really need to find soulmates. (people make spreadsheets about billion dollar markets, but when you drill down can&#8217;t justify it), find people from other areas to help out.</p>

<p>Q - How does an entrepreneur pick a professional w/ your background?</p>

<p>Betty - when you select a PR firm look at their track record, and find out exactly who you are going to be working with. Get some references and then check them, to make sure their contacts are valid. What the firm brings to the table is access.</p>

<p>Alan - picking a bank, find a bank which is interested in emerging companies, one that can make connections for you.</p>

<p>Dave - need a relationship that will grow with the company. Partnerships can really help there. Sarbanes-Oxley probably does not apply to the garage startup, but once you have a board you need to start worrying. (Note from Miker - Sarbanes-Oxley is a set of accounting reforms, setting down stricter requirements for practices within public companies. People seem to be making a big deal about it just about everywhere I go.)</p>

<p>Jeff - finding an investment bank, just execute on your vision and Wall Street will find you.</p>

<p>Mark talking about finding a lawyer - everyone specializes in certain areas. You are going to have to work with multiple people. You can expect your lawyer to make introductions (for funding for example). Work with someone who has been through the process before, multiple startups, and that person can find you the people that you need. Find someone who can tap into the community.</p>

<p>Guy says as you&#8217;re seeking a funding adviser you should ask if they&#8217;ve got contacts to find funding.</p>

<p>Q - What can you do to find good board members, what makes a good board member?</p>

<p>Alan - used the example of retired people from within your domain. Because he&#8217;s at a bank, he needs to make multiple referrals so that they don&#8217;t get into legal trouble. You should expect the same from other sources of referral as well, so you should have a bunch to choose from.</p>

<p>Dave - Sarbanes-Oxley says you need a financial adviser on the board.</p>

<p>Jeff - the board of an early stage company is much different than that of a company in a later stage. Investors are very active early on, but as you become more mature you need stricter controls and need to transform your board as necessary (without sacrificing the guidance)</p>

<p>Mark - Expertise, expertise, expertise, and objectivity. Make that dream list and try for it, even if you know you won&#8217;t make all of them. Find the person who will ask hard questions.</p>

<p>Q - what is the max you would offer the Perfect board member?</p>

<p>Mark - it depends on what stages this person is involved in. If the person can only spend two days a month, its valuable but not the same as someone who can spend time to be part of the team. Someone who is part of the team is VERY valuable. Don&#8217;t get caught up in percentages.</p>

<p>Betty - Look at your customer base and then go looking for advisers.</p>

<p><strong>Session 3 - The Art of Positioning and Presenting - Bill Joos</strong></p>

<p>The number one problem is talking about what you do concisely. Two points to concentrate on when trying to make your description concise are market definition and value proposition.</p>

<p>Bill had a set of worksheets that he quickly skimmed through, giving examples of how they would be filled out for a company called BitPass (someone that Garage had worked with) and general descriptions of what each section should include and what purpose it serves. He said that completing the exercise will take many hours. Early on it&#8217;s a living document, but eventually you want to freeze it.</p>

<p>The goal is to identify a few foundation points: &#8220;what do you do things for?&#8221; (market position) and &#8220;what are you doing?&#8221; (value proposition). Once you have that base established use it as the yardstick for your other communications.</p>

<p>Case study of BitPass - BitPass identified three major phases of the online digital content market. Phase 1 - everything is free. Phase 2 - paid subscriptions. Phase 3 - individual purchases (&#8220;pay by the sip&#8221;).</p>

<p>Identify primary and secondary constituents. At first BitPass thought that primary constituents were content sellers, and secondary constituents were digital content buyers. It can take an hour to get a group to agree to what primary is. Just follow the cash, they should be the biggest part of the pie <em>at the point at which you break even</em>. What comes out of finding these groups is a clear market definition. What Bitpass decided was that the primary are tier one providers.</p>

<p>Next identify the burning problem. The only thing selling these days are painkillers (not steroids or vitamins). Then identify symptoms (how do I know if I have this problem?). Then put them all back together and try to find common aspects, and then refine the burning problem.</p>

<p>Once you have the burning problem you need to find the pain associated with it. Your key constituent must be able to instantly identify with the Burning Problem and Big Pain.</p>

<p>What kind of emotion is associated with the problem or pain?</p>

<p>Create the company tagline. The tagline should &#8220;hook &#8216;em&#8221; and get them to ask for more.</p>

<p>Market definition is pulled together from those previous answers (who, pain, and emotion).</p>

<p>What do you really do? List everything, and pick stuff out later on. Boil them down once you have the list. This is the composite essence of what you do.</p>

<p>Your value proposition. Category + position parameters + benefits.</p>

<p>So you end up with who, pain, emotion on one side and painkillers and benefits. Yin and Yang. Generally things take the form of the problem being in the negative, and the solution positive.</p>

<p>Competition - make a page for each competitor. This is done from the point of view of outsiders. Pick everyone who a knowledgeable outsider would think is a competitor (not just who you yourself consider to be a competitor). Be comprehensive, and consider grouping is there are a lot. Pull all the pages together and determine how you are different. We are unlike Company who does stuff because we do otherstuff. Everyone in the company should differentiate themselves from the competitors at every chance. It should be natural to follow a mention of a competitor with an automatic summary of what your differentiators are.</p>

<p>Us Mission Statements vs. Them Mission Statements. Mission statements can talk about the company or talk about what the company can do for customers.</p>

<p>Take the time to do it right. Its a great team building experience. And you can reuse the bits and pieces for other efforts.</p>

<p>Now comes the presenting part of the session</p>

<p>What and How - most people concentrate too much on what and not how. They pay a lot of attention to the content of their statements and not how the statements are presented. The split should be more like 50/50 between the two.</p>

<p>Start at the end: pitch decay says that most people forget very quickly. You need to find the most important 10 percent are really drive it. Put your most important point right up front, first slide. Most people put their big conclusion at the end, this is wrong.</p>

<p>Be brief: all VCs have attention deficit disorder. Kill geek speak.</p>

<p>Bait the hook: get them interested. You don&#8217;t want your elevator pitch to close a deal, you want them to get off the elevator with you and ask for more info. It should be a call to action.</p>

<p>Get high and stay high, stay up at a high level so that you talk about what and benefits, not how. They will ask for how when they are ready.</p>

<p>Obey the 12/15 rule, a dozen slides in 15 minutes. An hour meeting does not mean an hour worth of slides. He had a list of what should be on the slides, I&#8217;ll fill in the details here at another point.</p>

<p>Change people&#8217;s pulse: audience, bond with them, communicate on their level.</p>

<p>Tell stories that sell: Questions to ask when preventing are - What are the three most important things you could learn about my company? What interested you about our business plan?</p>

<p>Get a transition: Ask a rhetorical question.</p>

<p>Practice and integrate feedback: videotape yourself, use a timer to make sure you can do your pitch in the time you have.</p>

<p>Develop an attitude: never give up.</p>

<p>In summary, Bills own opinion of the most important are : begin with the end, be brief, change peoples pulse.</p>

<p><strong>The Art of Raising Capital - Bill Reichert</strong></p>

<p>Q1 - is your idea fundable? Not everything is. You need a business that has potential for sustainable rapid growth, get to significant size and scale (billion dollar level, something that gets easier as you grow, a positive feedback loop), ongoing disproportionate profitability.</p>

<p>Q2 - What is the best way to raise capital? Start smart, get details right at the start. Tell a good story, internalize. Make the numbers add up. Find the right investors. Build credibility. More about these individual points below.</p>

<p>Start smart - put together a simple clean corporate structure (incorporate and founders stock, don&#8217;t start as an S Corp and then try to evolve later on) You get into trouble if you start promising percentages. And you NEED to setup buyback agreements. When you bring in employees and consultants do it right, with documentation, and that you own intellectual property. Have standard agreements. When you get seed investments and loans make sure you have the proper documents and you&#8217;ve done it with the right structure. Assume everything you&#8217;re doing is going to be public, pay attention to governance. Get the right attorney.</p>

<p>Tell a good story.Know how to articulate the fundamentals of your business. Every investor keeps a mental scorecard: the team, problem/opportunity, tech, sustainable advantage, business model, partnership/leverage. Saying something like &#8220;well, you have to ask my CTO&#8221; is a bad thing. Listen to what VCs seem to be concerned about and pitch to those issues.</p>

<p>Make the numbers add up. If they&#8217;re trusting you with millions of dollars, they want you to know how the money is going to be made. Long term financial projections (even if they&#8217;re not sure bets, you have to tell a story using numbers of your vision of what the future will be.) Just make sure that your projections would look like compared to past great companies. Most people show numbers that put their company better performing than the greatest companies in history. Near term operating plan, capital requirements, capitalization structure over multiple rounds, levers of profitability, what are the key metrics, how are you monitoring and measuring them?</p>

<p>The right investor. Generate momentum, develop the technology model, start building the team, &#8220;here is what we&#8217;ve done with nothing, imagine what we could do with your investment&#8221;. Pick the right firms, and the right partners within those firms. Target your venture contacts, but then drill down another level and make sure that the people on that list are the right target.. And if necessary go back to your network and see if you can get an introduction to the right partner at firms you have touch points for. Nurture a syndicate of investors, find a lead who would draft a term sheet. Be honest and build trust, get a lead investor that will help you develop the syndicate. Manage the selling process, finding venture is just a different kind of sale. Be aggressive.</p>

<p>Build credibility. Customers, having customers is a great. Partners. Investors. Advisers and board members. Industry experts. Milestones. Don&#8217;t lie! Top 10 lies from people looking for funding (Our projections are conservative, our target market is 56 billion, we have a world class team (just say what the strengths are), our average sales cycle is 90 days, we have no direct competition, no one else can do what we do (say why your advantage is sustainable), all we need is 2 percent of the market, we&#8217;ll be cash flow positive in 12 months, our contract with Nokia will be signed next week, I&#8217;ll be happy to turn over the reigns to a new CEO).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been really looking forward to the <a href="http://www.sentonline.com/">SENT</a> phonecam art show. I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye out for it since <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=4">my first post about it in November of last year</a>. Now it&#8217;s up and live, including a page that displays random images from those submitted by the public. Images are supposed to be submitted by mailing to submit at sentonline dot com. None of them have shown up on the random images page as far as I can tell. And it&#8217;s been three days since I sent the first one in. Either I&#8217;m doing something wrong (although I&#8217;ve verified the address a few times, and sent images to my own mail accounts to make sure everything is working), there&#8217;s something wrong with the mail processing on their side, or the images take a really long time to appear. I might email someone to find out what&#8217;s up, but probably not.</p>

<p>The tone of the show overall doesn&#8217;t match up with what I was expecting. The <a href="http://www.sentonline.com/project.html">project overview</a> page says:</p>

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ll explore the camera phone&#8217;s potential as a creative tool in two ways: through an online public dialogue in which amateur photographers and phonecam users around the world share mobile snapshots of their lives; and through an invitational exhibit in which professional photographers, artists, and public figures test the limits of creative possibilities offered by these hybrid devices.</p></blockquote>

<p>But right now it&#8217;s just a <a href="http://www.sentonline.com/images.html">page with a random image displayed each time you refresh it</a>. While technically it is a shared space that could be used to facilitate a dialog, you could say the same thing about a brick wall and a couple of cans of spraypaint. For me the appeal of mobile technology has been connection, something I assumed would be pretty common. I like having these capabilities in my cell phone because they keep me in touch with the people I want to stay close to. But the couple of photos I have sent have gotten flung off in to the great technical void. Very isolating. However, even if they made it up there, I would have no idea at all what people might like to say about them. Do I really want to fling bits of my life into the random photography frappe that&#8217;s up there now? On the one hand I&#8217;m joining into a communal process of creation, but on the other hand it&#8217;s a community which strips identity and the ability to continue communication. The images might as well come from anywhere. There&#8217;s no harnessing of the mobile part of the phonecam to continue communication in the form of an always on dialog. This could be a digital art show using digital cams and email without being phonecams. I was hoping to see some aspects which called out the unique capabilities of image sensors plus a communications channel, and I&#8217;m just not seeing that now.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I&#8217;m Mike Rowehl, a programmer and entrepreneur living in the San Francisco bay area.
    I&#8217;ve been working in the mobile industry for a long time, and have been involved in launching a bunch of startups in the space.
    I&#8217;ve been programming and working with open source projects for even longer.
    I&#8217;m a fan of high tech, and high tech startups in particular.
