  <div class="entry-content"><p>During a conversation on the <a href="http://onboardc.sf.net">OnBoardC</a> list, someone posted a link to a <a href="http://www.winikoff.net/palm/dev.html">page full of Palm Pilot development platforms</a>. It seems like a great list, although some of the info is a bit dated. I&#8217;ve been working with OnBoardC some, but have started to try to get more familiar with LispMe so that I can use that instead. There are at least a half dozen implementations on that list that I&#8217;ve never heard of. Guess it&#8217;s time to do some more evaluation :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3017">older post in Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s weblog</a> regarding open source and the forming of community. The discussion is great, and I think very informative. I would make the further point that the openness of the projects doesn&#8217;t only encourage participation in the form of feeding back fixes and features into the tree, it allows for users and potential developers to &#8220;play&#8221;. They can experiment with new ideas, try out fixes and features, and learn about the system. Even if they never feed back these changes to the core of the project, the community can be strengthened because of it. If that programmer shares just their ideas or insights without any new code, the project as a whole still gains. A minor point, but since I&#8217;m going to be comparing open source culture to prototyping culture (as described by Michael Schrage in Serious Play) it&#8217;s pretty important.</p>

<p>The community doesn&#8217;t arise just so that users can support each other, or so that they can fix bugs and add features. Schrage says &#8220;an interesting prototype emits the social and intellectual equivalent of a magnetic field, attracting smart people with interesting ideas about how to make it better.&#8221; Because of the nature of open source projects, they have the ability to act as prototypes in the sense that Schrage means. Proprietary products usually can not. Open source projects don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to work like prototypes, but they have the ability to. With most proprietary products there&#8217;s frequently no way for users to play under the hood, to experiment and start forming the dialog with the system from which innovation and intellectual momentum spring. The members of the community for an open source project don&#8217;t just communicate with each other, they communicate with the project. In closed projects the potential participants are inherently walled off from that very important aspect of cooperation.</p>

<p>Communities often do not form around projects, but rather through them. The project forms the shared space through which the community draws its coherence and strength. Most closed projects do not present the opportunity for this shared space to be established. The code really might have very little to do with the success or failure of an open source project. Success and failure could be dependant on the community. But I think the formation of the community stems from access to the code (no matter what the quality of that code is) and the ability of the project leaders to manage the community that arises around it. Different projects will attract different communities with different goals and different effective management styles. I think the points that Schrage brings directly apply to open source on these points. Check out <a href="http://www.manyworlds.com/index.asp?from=CO&amp;coid=CO780217203316">The Path to Innovation</a> Q&A; session for more of his ideas. If one agrees with those ideas, they can provide a major insight into the reasons why open source communities &#8220;work&#8221; while many communities formed around closed products do not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0875848141/qid%3D995128392/sr%3D2-1/ref%3Daps%5Fsr%5Fb%5F1%5F1/102-5381366-7152162">Serious Play</a> by Michael Schrage, and have found it extremely stimulating thus far. The book explores the basic &#8220;what role does the prototype play in innovation&#8221; type questions and the harder questions of how to manage a prototyping portfolio and how the various tradeoffs in prototyping can affect the shape of innovation as a whole. I wanted to read more, and I happened across <a href="http://www.manyworlds.com/index.asp?from=TL&amp;coid=CO9300216205890">this great site with links to lots of his articles</a>. <a href="http://www.manyworlds.com">ManyWorlds</a> seems like a great site in general, but I&#8217;ve only looked at the Schrage stuff so far. I would highly recommend checking out the articles, and picking up the book (I borrowed it from our local library actually) if you like what you see. The articles and the book are both insightful and thought provoking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you in the Bay Area, there&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1260&amp;mo=12&amp;yr=2003">Open Source Expo</a> at the San Francisco Airport Marriott this Thursday (that&#8217;s Dec 11, 2003). It&#8217;s pretty cheap considering the speakers they have lined up. And I&#8217;m very happy to see that they have both technical and business tracks. I&#8217;m definitely interested in the business track, so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll probably be. Topics include &#8220;New Business Models&#8221; and &#8220;Marketing and Selling OSS Effectively&#8221;, two topics that sound great now that Bitsplitter is really starting to ramp up. Speakers from IBM, RedHat, MySQL, Sleepycat, HP, and elsewhere. Looks like it could be an excellent event.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/1700">article over at kerneltrap.org</a> about the note that Marcelo sent to the Linux Kernel Mailing List. Seeing as 2.6 is starting to get pretty stable, after the next point release 2.4 will go into maintenance mode. That really just means that 2.4 will only get fixed if there are major bugs, that it won&#8217;t be getting any new features. So for those of you who like to dabble in the bleeding edge it&#8217;s a good time to start fooling around with the 2.6 test releases.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/799">older post at kerneltrap.org</a> about how to do the upgrade to 2.6, but it&#8217;s from a lot earlier in the series. Read through the comments there before you try it, particularly the ones about grabbing the <a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/">new modules packages from Rusty</a>. I&#8217;ve been running the 2.6-test series on my main desktop for a few months and it&#8217;s actually worked quite well without any tweeking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/002505.htm">interesting article over at Picturephoning</a> about using 2D barcodes and image recognition to get URLs into cameraphones. I&#8217;ve heard of projects something like this before, but most were companies looking to use their patented technology to make hordes of cash. I&#8217;m very happy to see that the <a href="http://semacode.org/">project page for Sem@code</a> describes the technology, but without tying it directly to a company. Which makes me think that the tech savy  among us can just print out images of these encoded URLs to try out. It does say that the recognition is proprietary, but that doesn&#8217;t keep others from making a different version of the recognition piece. I&#8217;m hoping that the technology itself is open, I think it would drastically change the adoption of the technique.</p>

<p>This still is really a stopgap solution, if we&#8217;re to trust the Bluetooth fans about &#8220;what could be&#8221; for their technology. Location based services have been on the floorplan for Bluetooth for as long as I can remember. The idea is that small Bluetooth radios would send out information to anyone in range about the local services that are avilable. So instead of pointing your cameraphone at the bus stop sign and decoding the url, you would just stand near the sign and select the &#8220;bus&#8221; service from the menu of local info. Of course, I heard about this so many years ago that I have to dredge up most of the details from foggy memory. Location based services are definitely a good idea. People do have a physical location, and their information devices should make use of that data. This provides an excellent way to provide location based services with pretty much just the hardware that people have today. Kudos, a great solution. I hope it goes far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/01/1070127346271.html">an article at the Sydney Morning Herald</a> explaining some of the issues with current content mangement systems. It caught my attention cause I&#8217;ve seen much the same thing. I&#8217;ve actually been working with a guy who implements websites as part of his consulting gigs, and we&#8217;ve been trying to come up with a simple system for managing sites. Most systems are either very complex or very simple, and just haven&#8217;t been fulfilling his needs. He wanted to have a system that he could use to create the site, and that he could partially deploy to the client. He wanted to have the option of allowing his clients to update their own sites. So we&#8217;ve been working on a system around that, something to do some simple site management and templating. Everything is done through a browser, against PHP scripts on the server. This means we can&#8217;t have nice integrated WYSIWYG HTML editing, but for his purposes that should be OK for now. And maybe by the time we get to the point where that may be an issue someone will have come up with a decent way to do that in the browser.</p>

SCO has been slogging it&#8217;s way through an inane lawsuit claiming that Linux is based off stolen code that SCO owns the rights to. Like most news, it&#8217;s kinda funny, mostly sad, and best taken in small doses. Lessig does a great job of making those small doses easy to swallow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1204/p14s02-stct.html">This article</a> at the Christian Science Monitor provides an excellent summary of the open source movement and potential ramifications with regard to intellectual property rights. I think the article does a great job of calling out the underlying issues, such as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Yet if the currency for development is information and ideas in the 21st century, where is the balancing point between the rapid innovation and responsiveness that collaborative projects can trigger and the longstanding legal structure designed to protect intellectual property rights?</p></blockquote>

<p>They&#8217;re tough questions, and the article does a great job of laying down how they fit together. Bravo Peter Spotts, great job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100146">an article over at TheFeature</a> about zoomable user interfaces, or ZUI for short. Some of the concepts given there are interesting, such as the calendar view that leaves the context of the month view around the edges of the screen when zoomed in to day view. Some of the others it&#8217;s kinda hard to see how they&#8217;re much different than hierarchal organization. In particular, the image view app seems to be nothing more than thumbnailing. I can see the benefit of maintaining visual context when navigating. But it really is a tricky human mind issue that creates a significant difference between disjoint screens and the ZUI. There could be some great applications for the technology, on PDAs as well as cell phones.</p>
