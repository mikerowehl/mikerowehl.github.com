  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100252">article over at The Feature</a> about a company called Wireless Ink. Wireless Ink is running <a href="http://winksite.com/site/index.cfm">a moblogging service</a> with hopes of extending it&#8217;s offering out to social networking apps in general. I like the position, as I&#8217;m into the mobile networking issue in general. And it seems like they&#8217;re really concentrating on the use of the technology, not just the technology itself (an essential element missing from most mobile application offerings).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m over at the Open Source Expo, sitting in the business track. Cause the business side is definitely where I&#8217;m weak. An interesting point came up during the investment panel related to the factors that realy stick out in the investor&#8217;s mind when looking at a company. Of course they take a look at the business plan of the company overall, but there were two qualifying factors that stuck out to me. The first is that the company has to be solving a hard problem. This is the same as the &#8220;barrier to entry&#8221; issue I&#8217;ve heard from <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com">Eleanor (my strategy consultant)</a> before. The second is that investors look particularly for solutions which revolutionize a whole vertical. An example given here was a CIO mandating replacing their existing platform with open source across the board.  OS, tools, database, the whole shebang. And enabling this for particular verticals is something that investors really look favorably upon. It&#8217;s a good summary of what to aim for I think, and it really helps out to describe what I do quite well. For many companies looking to explore using open source I can help provide those additional peices that enable them to clear the whole vertical.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have the 1.5 release of Vagablog <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">up on the Vagablog page</a>. The updates are relatively minor, but it explicitly says that WordPress and Movable Type are supported. And when Movable Type is being used, it hides the extra fields on the main screen. Maybe this will cut down on people misunderstanding Title field. I was hoping that people using the roll-your-own tools would at least skim the setup docs on the web. I should have known better. Now they just shouldn&#8217;t even be tempted. I&#8217;m planning to do the Metaweblog API soon, so that Movable Type does get title support.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a post over at Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s blog titled <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001189.html">TrackBack and Corporate Secrets</a>. It gives one example where traditionally convenient blogging features can be a pain for businesses. Blogs are moving into areas where the culture is significantly different than where they came from. Requirements of a business user can be radically different than those of the public blogger. Features which were convenient turn into security risks quite easily, as Jeremy points out. It can be painful, it can be dangerous, but that&#8217;s really what makes it interesting. I think blogs will play a big part in corporate infrastructure in the coming years. They fulfill the requirements of fluid communication in a way that no mix of technologies has been able to before. However, the reason they fulfill the requirements is because they grew up without many borders or limits, and that runs counter to the current corporate culture. So what happens when a new technology comes along that does a great job of solving a fundamental problem while also bringing along contradictory culture? I admit, I have no idea. But whatever it ends up being, I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s not &#8220;business as usual&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve posted <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/PalmHTTP/">the 2.0 version of PalmHTTP</a> on the Bitsplitter site, and reformated that page while I was at it. The interface to the library itself is now quite different, with covers for dealing with the URL struct, a POST struct and covers to deal with it, settings for the content type, and two example programs now. There&#8217;s still quite a bit to do, but the lib works for what I do, so the other stuff will probably just creep in over time. I&#8217;m accepting patches for it, of course. So <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">shoot me an email</a> if you have some.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/151145_vc05.html?source=rss">this article at seattlepi.com</a>, and I was kind of surprized by the tone.  Take this quote for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>With capital harder to come by in recent years, some venture capitalists have squeezed entrepreneurs with more stringent liquidation preferences. That has led many small business owners to &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; their enterprises or turn to friends and family members for money.</p></blockquote>

<p>That bootstrap in quotes really surprizes me. I thought that bootstraping was the standard way of starting up a business, and that &#8220;securing VC funding&#8221; should be the quoted exception. I think those who have been around the high stakes tech game for too long tend to forget that most companies are started without getting venture funding. It used to be that someone with an idea and some money (or access to people with some money) would pile together what they had and make the leap on their own. At least that&#8217;s how it was told in my high school economics class.</p>

<p>Yes, it takes money to start up a business, but that money doesn&#8217;t have to be the millions of dollars put up by fund groups. This radical new &#8220;bootstrapping&#8221; concept is really the way that almost all entrepreneurial initiatives get started. I thought this was what business planning was about, and at root the reasons for supply chain management and resource planning. We hear about these things from large companies, but they hold just as true for small companies as well. Somewhere people have to enter the playing field. Venture allows them to effectively materialize right in the middle of the game. And that can be a huge advantage, but only certain plays are well adapted to that advantage. For others it&#8217;s better to slowly work your way into the field, exploring as you go. That doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s anything wrong with venture, or with companies. That&#8217;s just the nature of the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/07/BUGMP3GOVK1.DTL">an interview with Marc Andreessen</a> over at SFGate.com, and it touches on lots of issues I figured would be near and dear to those still in the Bay Area. I share Marc&#8217;s sentiments on just about every issue. In particular the bursting of the bubble and the effect it&#8217;s had on the valley. I moved out here relatively recently. I already knew the bubble was burst before I made the move. I viewed it as a tremendous opportunity. There are all these high tech mavens out here, and lots of tech companies, and thousands of tallented programmers. But when you have that critical mass, once an area starts to draw people, it undergoes a process of swelling and restriction. The same thing happens at large companies.</p>

<p>Large companies will have a hiring spree when they need more people, but frequently some of those people don&#8217;t work out. They either aren&#8217;t the right fit for the skills needed, or there might be interpersonal issues, or management issues. Nothing wrong with that. The only way to know if the person is the right fit is to give them a try. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t work, that&#8217;s life. Many times the roles being left aren&#8217;t filled right away. The employees who remain are now somewhat seasoned. If things are running like &#8220;business as usual&#8221;, the employees left can take up the slack pretty easily. Because the employees are getting more efficient, sometimes extraneous postions can be laid off as well. Also, nothing wrong with that. So there&#8217;s a period of restriction for a while. But really, it&#8217;s also a period of increased productivity. And it only lasts until something interesting happens that forces the company to &#8220;bulk back up&#8221;.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t witnessed it at all, I&#8217;ve just come out here, but apparently this cycle holds for Silicon Valley as well. Marc mentions in his interview that it was dying down when he first came out, and that the state of the area now reminds him of what it was like at first. I think that&#8217;s great news. And really it&#8217;s the first time that I&#8217;ve heard someone say something like that. Maybe it&#8217;s cause Marc is one of the few to make it out in good position overall, and who isn&#8217;t bitter about trying to extend his reach too far. So overall, I think this is one of the most positive bits I&#8217;ve read in a long time and I wanted to pass it along. I&#8217;m trying to prop myself up in a position where I&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of  the next wave, and it&#8217;s great to hear from one of the old hands that he thinks there&#8217;s one coming along too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During a conversation on the <a href="http://onboardc.sf.net">OnBoardC</a> list, someone posted a link to a <a href="http://www.winikoff.net/palm/dev.html">page full of Palm Pilot development platforms</a>. It seems like a great list, although some of the info is a bit dated. I&#8217;ve been working with OnBoardC some, but have started to try to get more familiar with LispMe so that I can use that instead. There are at least a half dozen implementations on that list that I&#8217;ve never heard of. Guess it&#8217;s time to do some more evaluation :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3017">older post in Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s weblog</a> regarding open source and the forming of community. The discussion is great, and I think very informative. I would make the further point that the openness of the projects doesn&#8217;t only encourage participation in the form of feeding back fixes and features into the tree, it allows for users and potential developers to &#8220;play&#8221;. They can experiment with new ideas, try out fixes and features, and learn about the system. Even if they never feed back these changes to the core of the project, the community can be strengthened because of it. If that programmer shares just their ideas or insights without any new code, the project as a whole still gains. A minor point, but since I&#8217;m going to be comparing open source culture to prototyping culture (as described by Michael Schrage in Serious Play) it&#8217;s pretty important.</p>

<p>The community doesn&#8217;t arise just so that users can support each other, or so that they can fix bugs and add features. Schrage says &#8220;an interesting prototype emits the social and intellectual equivalent of a magnetic field, attracting smart people with interesting ideas about how to make it better.&#8221; Because of the nature of open source projects, they have the ability to act as prototypes in the sense that Schrage means. Proprietary products usually can not. Open source projects don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to work like prototypes, but they have the ability to. With most proprietary products there&#8217;s frequently no way for users to play under the hood, to experiment and start forming the dialog with the system from which innovation and intellectual momentum spring. The members of the community for an open source project don&#8217;t just communicate with each other, they communicate with the project. In closed projects the potential participants are inherently walled off from that very important aspect of cooperation.</p>

<p>Communities often do not form around projects, but rather through them. The project forms the shared space through which the community draws its coherence and strength. Most closed projects do not present the opportunity for this shared space to be established. The code really might have very little to do with the success or failure of an open source project. Success and failure could be dependant on the community. But I think the formation of the community stems from access to the code (no matter what the quality of that code is) and the ability of the project leaders to manage the community that arises around it. Different projects will attract different communities with different goals and different effective management styles. I think the points that Schrage brings directly apply to open source on these points. Check out <a href="http://www.manyworlds.com/index.asp?from=CO&amp;coid=CO780217203316">The Path to Innovation</a> Q&A; session for more of his ideas. If one agrees with those ideas, they can provide a major insight into the reasons why open source communities &#8220;work&#8221; while many communities formed around closed products do not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0875848141/qid%3D995128392/sr%3D2-1/ref%3Daps%5Fsr%5Fb%5F1%5F1/102-5381366-7152162">Serious Play</a> by Michael Schrage, and have found it extremely stimulating thus far. The book explores the basic &#8220;what role does the prototype play in innovation&#8221; type questions and the harder questions of how to manage a prototyping portfolio and how the various tradeoffs in prototyping can affect the shape of innovation as a whole. I wanted to read more, and I happened across <a href="http://www.manyworlds.com/index.asp?from=TL&amp;coid=CO9300216205890">this great site with links to lots of his articles</a>. <a href="http://www.manyworlds.com">ManyWorlds</a> seems like a great site in general, but I&#8217;ve only looked at the Schrage stuff so far. I would highly recommend checking out the articles, and picking up the book (I borrowed it from our local library actually) if you like what you see. The articles and the book are both insightful and thought provoking.</p>
