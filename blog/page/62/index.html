  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/01/1070127346271.html">an article at the Sydney Morning Herald</a> explaining some of the issues with current content mangement systems. It caught my attention cause I&#8217;ve seen much the same thing. I&#8217;ve actually been working with a guy who implements websites as part of his consulting gigs, and we&#8217;ve been trying to come up with a simple system for managing sites. Most systems are either very complex or very simple, and just haven&#8217;t been fulfilling his needs. He wanted to have a system that he could use to create the site, and that he could partially deploy to the client. He wanted to have the option of allowing his clients to update their own sites. So we&#8217;ve been working on a system around that, something to do some simple site management and templating. Everything is done through a browser, against PHP scripts on the server. This means we can&#8217;t have nice integrated WYSIWYG HTML editing, but for his purposes that should be OK for now. And maybe by the time we get to the point where that may be an issue someone will have come up with a decent way to do that in the browser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001611.shtml">This entry</a> in the lessig blog presents an analysis of the <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/trends/03/12/04/2024240.shtml?tid=85">open letter</a> from Darl McBride, CEO of SCO. SCO has been slogging it&#8217;s way through an inane lawsuit claiming that Linux is based off stolen code that SCO owns the rights to. Like most news, it&#8217;s kinda funny, mostly sad, and best taken in small doses. Lessig does a great job of making those small doses easy to swallow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1204/p14s02-stct.html">This article</a> at the Christian Science Monitor provides an excellent summary of the open source movement and potential ramifications with regard to intellectual property rights. I think the article does a great job of calling out the underlying issues, such as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Yet if the currency for development is information and ideas in the 21st century, where is the balancing point between the rapid innovation and responsiveness that collaborative projects can trigger and the longstanding legal structure designed to protect intellectual property rights?</p></blockquote>

<p>They&#8217;re tough questions, and the article does a great job of laying down how they fit together. Bravo Peter Spotts, great job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100146">an article over at TheFeature</a> about zoomable user interfaces, or ZUI for short. Some of the concepts given there are interesting, such as the calendar view that leaves the context of the month view around the edges of the screen when zoomed in to day view. Some of the others it&#8217;s kinda hard to see how they&#8217;re much different than hierarchal organization. In particular, the image view app seems to be nothing more than thumbnailing. I can see the benefit of maintaining visual context when navigating. But it really is a tricky human mind issue that creates a significant difference between disjoint screens and the ZUI. There could be some great applications for the technology, on PDAs as well as cell phones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/002486.htm">post at picturephoning</a> about a Symbian app that allows for remote commands to request an image from the handset. One possible app is finding your phone if you&#8217;re lost, but there are lots of others.  The page for the app mentions using it to check the weather at a weekend cottage or checking up on the kids. Most people can&#8217;t imagine leaving their cell somewhere just so they can get pictures from it. Not yet at least. But Nokia has actually been looking in this direction for a while, and has out a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,4654,00.html">product specifically aimed at these kinds of apps</a>. It&#8217;s still a very pricey product unless you have some special needs. But these kinds of things have a way of coming down over time. And I could see many parents easily forking over a few hundred plus the price of an extra SIM attached to their account in order to have a video baby monitor they can access from anywhere.</p>

<p>They also provide a great opportunity to spy. Some people have been up in arms about camera phones and how they can be used to invade privacy. They&#8217;ve called for the banning of the phones in some areas, and I&#8217;ve heard that some corporations are considering banning the devices from their facilities. Imagine how much more agitated a phone like this will make those people. It also has great use for corporate espionage. One needs just place the camera in the right place and they can retreive their images from anywhere. The intruder doesn&#8217;t have to be within range of their bug, they don&#8217;t have to hook into existing facility resouces, and the RF signature is nothing special (this is something that&#8217;s commonly used to detect a listening device, the use of non-standard frequencies). Use the phone with a prepaid SIM, and it makes for a great bugging device.</p>

I&#8217;m not sure about market numbers, and I have no clue about the actual implementation of the system, but taken in the abstract I think this sounds like a great idea. Everyone has clearly accepted digital photography, but there is a possible issue with getting good hardcopy. Not everyone has a high quality printer, but sometimes you do want to send a print to grandma for xmas. Nice position.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/intel.html">an article</a> in Wired about Intel&#8217;s play to get wireless sensors shrunk down over coming years. I&#8217;ve been working with some people looking to make products using existing sensor networks technologies. I&#8217;ve gone to a couple of sensor network specific workshops and forums in the area, including the Hitachi/Stanford Workshop on Wireless Sensor Networks. It&#8217;s very interesting technology, and I can definitely see where systems of this sort would have great applications. But the hardware that&#8217;s available now for sensor networks is pretty expensive still. The systems aren&#8217;t that small. They do provide wireless networking capability, which is definitely a differentiator in a device of that size and cost. Even the researchers seem to think that the technology is still in the formative stage. It&#8217;s definite that the mesh networking still needs to be worked through to a great degree. But even leaving that aside I have some concerns.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to try to familiarize myself with the TinyOS system and get a feel for what the extents of the system can be. In particular, should we be looking to use something else in the initial implementation of our prototypes? We&#8217;re not really sure what the data throughput requirements will be for the application yet, and we don&#8217;t have a lot of slack to play with when the peak throughput of the wireless interface is 30 or 40 Kbps. I guess only time will tell. But if others out there are looking at using the MOTES platform in upcoming projects and looking at the same issues, please <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">mail me</a>. I would be interested in exchanging ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994434">article at NewScientist.com</a> about a new network mapping project called Opte.

They&#8217;re interesting both for the theory and implementation detail that goes into the mapping software, and because they make pretty pictures.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.txt4.info/pages/research_research.htm">release by TXT4info</a> about the use of text messaging as a marketing tool. Apparently it great that the firm did the research, because no one was really sure if customers liked being charged a lot of money. And they were a bit sketchy on if the customers liked being spamed.  From the report:</p>

<blockquote><p>Commenting on the report, Mr. Brendan Foley, Sales and Marketing Director for TXT4info said, &#8220;This comes as no surprise that users do not like premium charge SMS. We have built a business and a reputation on putting the customer first by working with brands and Ad agencies to create campaigns that are on FreeTXT or LowTXT. That way everyone wins.&#8221; He cited the Crisis Pregnancy Agency as a perfect example where TXT4info had provided a FreeTXT service. Already 58,000 requests for information have been received on this service in the last 12 months.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Foley went on to say, &#8220;Charging the consumer to interact with a brand through SMS is like charging them to look at an outdoor poster or listen to the ad on the radio. The consumer just won&#8217;t buy into that, yet some people think they will buy into premium rate SMS marketing!&#8221;.</p>

<p>Okay, good. Seemed rather obvious to me, but sometimes that happens. It takes quite a while to sync up. But now that at least some of us are apparently thinking in the same directions, let me lay down a few follow on thoughts that I&#8217;ve had kicking around for a while.</p>

<p>First of all, lets take a brief look at how the SMS systems are structured in terms of cost. For the basic SMS exchange, one mobile user sending a message to another mobile user, both the sender of the message and the recipient are charged. Nothing surprizing there, both use the network. However, the same is true for service providers. If I run <a href="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a>, a software release information site, and I would like to add the ability for users of the site to get SMS messages when updates are posted for their watched software, I can&#8217;t do it. At least not without some major changes. Freshmeat would have to pay to send messages to each of the users who wanted to get messages. Freshmeat isn&#8217;t a pay site. There&#8217;s a problem here, of course. Depending on your outlook you might think this is a &#8220;feature&#8221; more than a problem, but I disagree.</p>

<p>I contest that having great content has nothing to do with being willing to pay for people to be able to access it. Think of all the internet fads that go around - cute email messages, funny images that get forwarded all over, dancing-* movies sites, the &#8220;weapons of mass destruction&#8221; joke error page, etc. The low cost of publishing on the Internet is what makes it the revolutionary medium it is. I think that SMS would benefit greatly from being able to share in this. There should be peer-to-peer style messaging between entities on the SMS network an the Internet. Errecting a false barrier (in terms of a service charge to send a message from the Internet out to an SMS handheld) only serves to restrict the usefulness of the SMS network. Sure, the phone companies would lose some money per-transaction if they&#8217;re only charging half the fee on some exchanges. But I think they would more than make up the difference in volume.</p>

<p>The common issue that gets brought up here is spam. If there is no charge for sending into the SMS network then the volume of spam sent to cell phones will be unbearable. I don&#8217;t buy it, that&#8217;s a lame excuse. Some one can solve that issue. It might take some work, investment, in order to do so. But it&#8217;s not rocket science. And that might go so far as keeping an &#8220;allowed senders&#8221; list for each phone number on the cell network. That is NOT an unbearable service to run. Telcos already have all sorts of equiptment to allow for call blocking and call forwarding and tracking and reporting. No one can tell me that having a filter list for SMS is a crippling requirement.</p>

<p>So there it is, how to drive SMS usage through the roof. It&#8217;ll work. It&#8217;ll just take more planning to get right than has gone into the haphazard deployment of cell networks so far. If you run a cell network, feel free to use that idea. Please, please, feel free to use this idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently went to listen to <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1206&amp;mo=11&amp;yr=2003">the VP of Product Marketing from PalmSource, Charlie Tritschler, speak at a SDForum Web Services Special Interest Group</a>. The presentation itself was very informative. It sounded like Palm was really taking a great approach to Web Services. Charlie spoke about how PalmSource had a package available for writing SOAP clients for the Palm, and how they were planning to push support for web services down into the operating system in future versions. I think this stuff is a great idea, and have had <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/openSource/palmos.html">some thoughts about making the palm more network-centric</a> online for a while myself. So I have no problem at all marching to the beat of that drum, it matches up perfect with the pace I was keeping anyway. So I went to download the toolkit from Palm, and had to eat my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The first cause for concern was that I had to go to this section called the &#8220;Developer Seeding Area&#8221; at <a href="http://www.palmsource.com">PalmSource</a> to find info about the package. I won&#8217;t bother providing a link to the area, cause you can&#8217;t get access unless you&#8217;re registered as a Palm developer. That&#8217;s the first bad sign, that Palm has lumped this wonderful enabling technology in with their older information controlled releases. Why do they restrict these public releases? I&#8217;m sure they say so that they can get to know their development community better. But I&#8217;m definite all they do is alienate the open source developers. Bad move. And then once I did find a link to the toolkit, it took me to another area, at <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/">IBM alphaWorks</a>, this time with another license agreement. And then, when I did download it, I found out that the release was for Windows only. Ouch.</p>

<p>So, props to PalmSource for the effort. But they seem to be missing the boat on this one. Web Services are a great idea, but not just because they&#8217;re a simple format for performing RPC. The reason they&#8217;ve gone so far so fast is that they represent the open source culture at work. RPC is not a new idea. Open formats and tools, encouraging further open formats and more free tools, that&#8217;s what made the concept so powerful. That&#8217;s why this idea has become the universal connector, and why it makes business sense to &#8220;Web Service&#8221;-ify all types of applications. Allowing the Palm platform to tap into that interface is a great idea. But providing a very Old World set of tools to do so is half-assed. To get the full advantage of Web Services we need to embrace the culture of the Web Services crowd. I think this represents an oportunity to inflame the imagination of some otherwise lost developers. The path that they&#8217;ve taken is little more than marginal pandering, and Web Services could really fling open the doors standing at the network interface of the Palm platform and allow some great innovation.</p>

<p>Put my code where my mouth is? Sure, you bet I will. It starts like this. Add a dash of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/PalmHTTP/">HTTP support</a> to a cup full of <a href="http://cytheric.net/palm-xml/doc/index.html">XML support</a> and blend vigorously till you can see foam starting to form. What I have to do is add an XMLRPC-EPI type interface to parse along the lines of allowed and expected rpc elements, and create some XML generation procedures, and we should have an open source platform for web services. Expect an entry in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/splitbits.html">Split Bits Area</a> once I have something working.</p>
