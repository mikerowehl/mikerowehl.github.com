  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/">BloggerCon</a> is under way this morning. I&#8217;m over at my apartment listening to the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">ITConversations</a> cast instead of heading over to Stanford. I might wander over at some point, but this morning started with a mad dash to peice back together <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/">Elle&#8217;s blog</a> from SQL dumps. Never fun. So I think I&#8217;m just going to sit here and drink coffee and watch what goes through in IRC for a while (#bloggercon on freenode.net).</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s come through the pipe so far? Everyone seemed to love the comments that <a href="http://www.theworld.org/about/bios/kahn.shtml">Tony Kahn</a> made when he introduced himself. He&#8217;s over there and interested in talking about the intersection of blogging type activities and the future of Public Broadcasting. Tag your photos in <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> as &#8216;bloggercon&#8217; so that we can see them <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bloggercon">in the tag listing</a>. Kevin Marks dropped in <a href="http://www.technorati.com/live/topmp3s.html">a Technorati link giving most talked about MP3s</a>. The bloggercon sessions should show up there once they get uploaded.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went over to the <a href="http://www.baychi.org/bof/mobile/20041028/">BayCHI presentation on Mobile Media Metadata</a> last week. Fantastic stuff. Marc Davis from <a href="http://garage.sims.berkeley.edu/">Garage Cinema Research</a> spoke about <a href="http://garage.sims.berkeley.edu/research.cfm">the research they have going on</a>. The presentation he gave focused mostly on mobile metadata. For now lets just talk about images. One of the points he made was that image classification systems tended to focus completely on the image itself. They look at a stream of bits and either attempt to determine the content of the image or attempt to fufill queries based entirely on those bits. But with the source of photo content increasingly being connected mobile devices, there&#8217;s potentially a much richer source of info than the bits themselves. The temporal and spatial information can potentially tell the system a lot more about an image than can be inferred from the image itself. Add in some social aspects, such as &#8220;what have others who have taken pictures in approximately this location used as the subject of their photos&#8221;, and the system can infer quite a bit.</p>

<p>This is one of the aspects that&#8217;s missing from the wider practice of blogging. Efforts like GeoURL started getting me looking in this direction. And most recently the buzz around <a href="http://www.plazes.com/">Plazes</a> got me looking back. There really should be a general distributed system for looking at information in the blogosphere based on time and location. Right now our main methods of organization are social (or something like it). Most people read someones blog, they&#8217;re picking people who have interests that mirror what they want to hear about and subscribing to those feeds. There are plenty of topical blogs, which helps to refine that subscription list somewhat. But that&#8217;s decomposition based on taxonomy (or folksonomy). That works great for getting news, but that&#8217;s only one potential pattern for information flow. The whole flashmob thing popped up and died down pretty quick, but there were a few nuggets in there that we probably shouldn&#8217;t ignore. Such as information flow around a particular event at a particular time in a particular location. How do you arrange information around an event like this? Seems like it would be a pretty common problem. One that&#8217;s likely to get more and more common with an increase in mobile usage. But right now there&#8217;s really not a great answer to it. Shared blogs are setup for events that get planned well in advance. But even there the support doesn&#8217;t seem to fit the pattern that I think most users would like.</p>

<p>When I first heard about the trackback mechanism I was hoping that this would provide at least a partial answer. Someone could setup a trackback location for the event and everyone who has something to say would post on their own and register the link with the event trackback. In practice however there are a bunch of issues with that. First off, of course, is that you need to know that trackback location in advance. Then there are technical hurdles with the trackback mechanism not really being understood or tailored for the novice user. It&#8217;s a good idea, but maybe not the best. Ideally we would want everyone to just post their info independently, and have a system that allows us to find all those posts after the fact due to knowing the location and time of the event. In the end, this is really what you probably want for news creation also. Lots of times the news is made because something unexpected happened. One would want those news capturers to be able to just click away and record media, which we consumers could go back and find. I think this is one of the basic building blocks missing right now from blogging. Being able to say something like &#8220;what did people say at the protest last night in Palo Alto&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t have to be based on knowing who the people are who are most likely to have been at the protest. Right now we&#8217;re substituting social information as a proxy for some forms of metadata that we could have direct access to. Social information is certainly a great source, and a fantastic way to organize a system so that it connects people to what they want in the absence of other factors. But before we go too far down that path I think we need to pay a little attention to the other factors that can be used in organizing these information flows. A lot of this information is coming in from the world outside, away from our desks. Just like image analysis, paying attention only to who said it and what the content is ignores some very rich info. There is a world outside, apparently. Lets try to acknowledge it a bit more.</p>

<time datetime="2004-10-28T11:13:22-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 28<span>th</span>, 2004</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was over at <a href="http://www.ctia.org/conventions_events/index.cfm">CTIA</a> for a while the other day.  I already wrote about the <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/10/amazing-turnout.html">BAMF meeting that we had afterward</a>, that kicked ass. But I really should write something of my own about CTIA. I was personally pretty disappointed. I forget who exactly said it, but someone at the BAMF meeting said &#8220;it was all about how to make the carriers even more money.&#8221;  Yea, unfortunately, that is very accurate.  It&#8217;s not that I expect everyone to have the same overall view of mobility as I have.  But I would expect someone to be able to get some representation for the interesting new apps out there.  The closest that I really saw were a couple of booths talking about interesting applications for location based services.  For the most part the location based stuff was all the same normal pitch.  &#8220;We have the largest point of interest database anywhere!&#8221; Yea, sure, but I bet most of the points I&#8217;m most highly interested in still aren&#8217;t in there.</p>

<p>So why do I keep bitching about mobility. Why am I working on getting the BAMF meetings together and trying to hook up people whenever I can?  Cause I really do think that mobility is due for a discontinuous innovation cycle. What&#8217;s that all about? The whole concept of discontinuous innovation I&#8217;ve heard most often associated with Clayton Christenson.  If you&#8217;re interested in hearing a heavily tech industry slanted version of his take, go over to IT Conversations and pick up <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail135.html">his speech from the Open Source Business Conference</a>. At a very very high level, the concept is that a new type of technology comes along (or a new type of business model, or a new method of transportation, etc) and eventually completely destroys the old way of doing things.  I think that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re seeing in the mobility industry. There are a lot of really valuable applications that could be out there making peoples lives better. But the deployment of those applications is really held up because the mobile industry is very tied to the old old telecom industry. The telecom industry would really love for mobility to be another one of their cash cows. But the telecom industry wants the mobile industry to fit into the patterns that the telecom industry is already familiar with and is set up to exploit.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the big deal you might ask?  If there&#8217;s so much great mobility stuff that could be done, why aren&#8217;t people out there doing it?  Normally that is how it happens.  New companies come up and just wipe out the old companies.  For some information about the concepts behind that look up Schumpeter, and the concepts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">Creative Destruction</a>. The idea there is that markets don&#8217;t allow companies to evolve so much as the market itself evolves through a series of new companies, each set more fit than the last.  So something should come along and replace telecom to form a new version of the mobile market, right?  Well in theory. One of the problems is that there&#8217;s limited spectrum on which wireless can run.  The actual radio signals used to communicate from handsets to the cell towers have to be licensed from the government. Those licenses cost a hell of a lot of money, and there are limited slots available. That means the only people even in the running have to be extremely well funded.  That really rules out just about any form of upstart being able to come in and compete. So the mobile industry is kinds stuck in this world of the old telecom industry, and regulation does it&#8217;s best to make sure that things stay that way.</p>

<p>I personally think that this is one of the reasons that 802.11 and other short range alternatives are positioned as alternatives to cellular.  Technically they should be a completely different category.  Although they do some of the same stuff, I think there&#8217;s more different than there is that&#8217;s the same.  However, 802.11 is unregulated. Anyone can come in and setup a base station and provide service over all small area. 802.11 has grown very rapidly because of that. A somewhat normal user an service their own needs.  Businesses can make inroads to setting up a service network without the crippling charges that they would have to pay for license fees. 802.11 creates a low barrier to entry alternative to cellular, and that encourages experimentation. It invites the startups to play with new ideas, and becomes the defacto platform for the innovative sollutions. In some ways the cellular market is cutting itself off from interesting new applications.</p>

<p>So would I really expect CTIA to pay a lot of attention to the new medium of mobility rather than the existing market of mobility?  No, not really.  But I can still hope sometimes.  At CTIA, the hope was misplaced.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A recent article (<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2004/10/14/page_controller.html">Migrating to Page Controllers</a>) does an excellent job of combining theory with some concrete examples and immediate benefits. The article provides a simple technique for factoring the controller out of the view processing when writing PHP code. Although not necessary for everything, architecture along this direction can really pay off for web apps. Many of the PHP apps that I&#8217;ve looked at recently have stand alone pages, and that can make them pretty hard to transform. The trend to move all the processing up to the front of the page helps out quite a bit. Programmers now tend to setup their objects and variables all in one block at the top, and then include the display pages with minimal markup to output the dynamic bits. Unfortunately error display still gets stuck into the logic pretty often. It certainly helps out quite a bit to have all the processing done up front, and that&#8217;s half way to the page controller model. The final bit is the refactoring to pull the different views out of the logic and defining a consistent scheme for passing the display info to them. I like the way the description comes off, very practical and tailored towards those who have to refactor their apps to make them look like this.</p>

<p>Check out the earlier article, <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2004/07/08/front_controller.html">Building a PHP Front Controller</a>, as well. That gives the same kind of treatment to overall application flow. A minimal set of changes to bring about huge benefits. I&#8217;ve seen a few big products aimed at trying to formalize the separation between overall application flow and page processing, and it can certainly be taken to extremes. When it&#8217;s all said and done, reworking the flow of an application can be complex if you&#8217;re using a flow engine or if you&#8217;re using standalone pages with some application and display objects. I was happy to see that the article included a bit of commentary about when to use a front controller and when it might be unnecessary overhead:</p>

<blockquote><p>Few techniques are suitable for everyone. If your web site updates involve adding new pages in-flight, then the overhead of the map maintenance may work against you. However, if the dynamic nature of your site depends on something outside of the raw pages (such as a database) or if your changes involve carefully-tested migrations, then the Front Controller technique may benefit you long-term.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the Q&A; at the Niklaus Wirth talk last night someone mentioned formal methods from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._A._R._Hoare">Hoare</a> school of work. Such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare Logic</a>. In particular they were asking why the work there had fallen out of favor, and wasn&#8217;t used more widely. Which got me thinking about the cost of axiomatic proof of computer systems. Which got me thinking about my background in computer security.</p>

<p>Before I had a job within a large company doing computer security, I used to think that security professionals spent most of their time updating access control lists, looking at packet logs, auditing application code, and doing all sorts of technical stuff. I thought that computer security within organizations was all about keeping people out of your data and off your systems. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s about spending as little as possible on issues related to the security of your computers. It&#8217;s not all about keeping people off your systems. It&#8217;s about figuring out how much it costs the company if people do make it onto your systems, and then figuring out how much it keeps to keep those people off your systems, and then picking whichever of those two costs less. Like insurance, it&#8217;s all about risk management.</p>

<p>Of course all kinds of issues get wrapped up in figuring out how much a compromise costs.  If it&#8217;s a public compromise there&#8217;s image damage to take into account, in particular the effect on customer confidence. But at heart it&#8217;s a weighing of the expected losses due to intrustion (chance of occurance times cost per incident) against the cost of prevention. If it costs more to prevent than it does to sweep under the rug, you take the chance with the unprotected system and hope for the best. The security guys make jokes about the only secure computer being one that&#8217;s kept locked in the basement, disconnected from the network, and switched off. That&#8217;s the cost of 100% security, 0 productivity. That&#8217;s one of the nasty points of security, it is impossible to reduce the exposure risk to 0% and still get work done with the system. No matter how much money you put in, there&#8217;s always a chance of compromise. And the cost grows exponentially as you get closer to the low end of the risk scale. More and more money buys you less and less relative change in security.</p>

<p>Given this environment any business doing work on the Internet would be crippled with security costs if they were trying for absolute security. Nothing would ever get done. Ever. So the solution to costs spiralling out of control is the risk management approach. An implementation plan is based not on doing things absolutely correctly, but based on what can be done that will cost less than the perceived cost of doing nothing at all. I see a direct correlation here with software engineering. The question is not how to build a system which is 100% correct, but how to build a system that delivers more value than it costs to develop. In my mind that&#8217;s why the ideas from the formal verification end of computer science aren&#8217;t in more general use. The cost of training people with these tools, and then using them in building systems, raises the cost of systems beyond the cost of just not writing them at all.</p>

<p>Most business people understand the concept, but I think it&#8217;s probably so ingrained that it rarely get articulated explicitly. And this is probably partially responsible for the tension between business and technical concerns in most projects. It doesn&#8217;t help that most software engineering practices don&#8217;t acknowlege this end of the engineering tradeoff at all (with the very notable exception of agile practices, something that I&#8217;m just realizing as I&#8217;m writing this). It&#8217;s hard to come up with numbers attached to the exposure risk in security, and that analysis is normally done at a stage when the issue is much better understood than it is during the development stage. In the absence of those numbers, it seems as if there are very few instances where system development rigor makes it all the way out to formal verification and still stays below the cost of dealing with errors. Given the huge cost associated with changing development practices, a very strong case would have to be made before the attempt could be considered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The success of Pascal came many years after it was done, due to the availability of microcomputers. Now there were lots of people available to program who didn&#8217;t have to unlearn Fortran. It was driven forward by Borland making the compiler available for only 50 dollars, when other compilers cost thousands. This made a mass market for Pascal.</p>

<p>Many systems at this point could only be built by teams. A way to partition systems was necessary, and led to the the concept of modules, and the development of Modula. Most people still stck with Pascal. Wirth expected everyone in their right mind to switch from Pascal to Modula, but they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Started working on Oberon, which was implemented based on object oriented techniques. But it was never recognized as an object oriented language. It didn&#8217;t cleave to the trends at the time, so it was excluded.</p>

<p>So&#8230; This is supposed to be about how he got interested in languages. Does he consider a career spent on programming languages well spent? He has always considered himself a teacher, but he knows he can&#8217;t teach good design. That takes examples, and is supported by a good language. A complicated syntax and voluminous description is a sign of a poor language. Rules governing the language must be determined apart from the implementation.</p>

<p>Measured on this scale, progress has been made. It was worth the time. Most important now is educating programmers on how to use those tools as best as they can. There is a lot more to do.</p>

<p>The essence of programming languages:</p>

<p>To provide a level of abstraction from details of computers.</p>

<p>To provide a suitable model of computation</p>

<p>To allow mathematical reasoning without recourse to knowledge about the underlying mechanisms</p>

<p>For this we require a concise and precise definition.  Fat manuals are a reliable symptom of failure</p>

<p>Then comes Q and A.</p>

<p>The story of Wirth building a helecopter control system. The trick was to make it disappear. It turned into a cyclic turning process. Taking values from sensors and moving actuators. The whole system is Oberon, only one page of code.</p>

<p>Overloading and templates: Wirth says overloading makes sense and belongs in the basic object oriented toolbox. However he says he has some reservations about the way that most systems implement it, Oberon did it very elegently. Never was able to make good use of templates, but some people might.</p>

<p>Knuth stood up and asked about recursion being missing from the original Pascal spec.  It was true, but it was there by the first implementation.</p>

<p>Question about what languages will people be using in thirty years. Wirth says that most people don&#8217;t program the way that he used to. Now they pick up bits of code from other places. This leads to bloat. In thirty years there will just be more bloat.</p>

<p>Question about functional programming. He says they are interesting, but not really very useful. All so called functional languages have an assignment hidden somewhere. He thinks that people who are fans of functional languages are actually fans of programming without non-local variables.  The fans say thats really very close to the truth.  And Wirth says that he programs like that himself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s some quick notes from the talk that Niklaus Wirth gave at the Computer History Museum on Oct 20th. The topic was &#8220;How I Became Interested In Computer Languages&#8221;.</p>

<p>Professsional career really started in Berkley. Thats when his real experience with computers started. Was always into modeling, and a lot of qualites cary over. Using tools, experimenting, persevering in spite of crashes. Liked physics and chemistry, and didn&#8217;t really pay attention to languages.</p>

<p>When model airplane parts became available, he was forced to study electronics in order to use them. Got theory at University and practice at home. Eary playing with computers took a long time, and ran into people who were working on a translator for computer languages, called a &#8220;compiler&#8221;. Only one person really understood the program, and it was messy, so he decided that the practice of building compilers need structure.</p>

<p>The early version lacked abstraction, it did not abstract away details of the computer hardware. Still it was easier than previous methods.</p>

<p>At the time thing were beautiful in Berkley, golden years. Before Flower Power. He joined in a seminar about Algol. Based on mathematical rigor. There was a clear way to figure out if a text was a valid program. Decided to write a compiler for it. The compiler was short and very simple. Met a witty and engaging person who tossed about some interesting ideas. Made Wirth think about a reduced Algol that had the same expressive power as the original. Wijngaarden.</p>

<p>Became a professor, and people were still trying to figure out what to teach about computers besides languages.  IE. Data structures. The challenge was to introduce rigor into semantics as well as syntax. Although Algol was interesting it didn&#8217;t suit practice very well.</p>

<p>Implemented Algol-W at SLAC. That was a stepping stone to his professional career. He made frequent trips, even overseas, which was not common at the time. There were heated discussions all over about the future of Algol. Algol always remained an academic exercise, never accepted into industry.</p>

<p>Programming became more and more complex, projects became very large, and even large companies drifted dangerously close to collapse. They were not able to deliver on their promises. This is what led to structured programming. Now one person didn&#8217;t have to understand the whole system. This was very far ahead of its time (and maybe still is).</p>

<p>Thing were getting bad with the Vietnam war, and he was offered a job in Zurich to continue work on Algol. He took it. Without having to work with comittee, he was able to work towards what he wanteed. The stuff he wanted stemed from having to teach languages and keeping the compiler clean. The idea was to write the compiler quick in Fortran, and implement the new lanuage, Pascal. Eventually, they had to scrap it. The decision was made to write Pascal in Pascal. The Pascal compiler was translated into another language for which there was a compiler to bootstrap.</p>
