  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the Making Money session of <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org">BloggerCon</a>, someone told a story about writing a book that ended up selling for $40. And the referral fee paid by Amazon for someone buying the book using a link from his blog ended up being twice the fee paid him by the publisher for each book sold. Interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are some of the thoughts I&#8217;ve had in relation to the <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org">BloggerCon</a> Overload session led by <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Robert Scoble</a>. A lot of the discussion was focused at how to navigate the deluge of information that comes from being subscribed to a lot of blogs. Possible solutions raised were collaborative filtering and recommendation systems (such as the <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml">attention.xml</a> effort), additional metadata, and filtering by intermediaries. There&#8217;s another parallel problem in how to deal with there being millions of blogs, and how do you pick the blogs to read.  I think the latter problem is more general. How does the average user end up being able to include blogs in their reading habits? How do we structure a system for end users that doesn&#8217;t impose the same kind of intermediary or chanel delivery system that blogs are supposed to work around?</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t really hear any comments about looking at the real end user problem for this. Reading blogs is still very much a geek activity, except the cases where people have set up sites to syndicate other content and that&#8217;s how it makes it to the users. How could we integrate a set of tools so that the knitting story that Scoble tells applies to general users? Scoble spoke about looking up some crafts activity (I think it was knitting, maybe I&#8217;m wrong there though). He did a search on <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> and found out who the mavens in that community were based on the linking habits. That&#8217;s fantastic! But not the kind of thing we can expect the average user to do. For me the question is more how do we make a system that uses that data like Scoble did, but applies an interface suitable for the average user? Is such a system even realistic? If so is it desirable? To a degree we already have an authority system based in linking in the way that <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> does page ranking. So what would be differentiating about the system based on blogs instead of pages? Is the important aspect that we can subscribe to a resource? Or that we can &#8220;join in the conversation&#8221; thanks to Technorati or trackbacks or feedster?</p>

<p>For me, the major advance in the habit of blogging is the recognition that there is value in loosely coupled group activity. That a group of people working together to discuss and monitor information are able to &#8220;emerge&#8221; interesting topics to the front of the content flow. That&#8217;s a reversal of what computer scientists and programmers normally look for. We tend to ignore the social issues and look for ways to use just the data itself to make new systems. The group action that arises in the blogosphere in general is a result not of one person having a great tool, but of a group of people being able to do little bits and peices. No one has authority, and yet the group can provide useful information from complex interactions. I think if we empower any one part of the system too much that system could break down. And that&#8217;s what I really think of when talking about how to make it possible to consume massive quantities of blog posts. We&#8217;re thinking about how to empower the parts that have traditionally worked, the A-list bloggers who currently get a lot of attention, so that they can do more. What we should be talking about is how to spread out the activity, not concentrate it. How do we get more people involved so that there is less filtering that needs to be done? The question in this area I think should follow the direction that attention.xml is taking. Not how do I read 15,000 posts, but how do I find the 10 other people who post exactly the 20 stories a day that I want to read? And of course, how can I continue to tune that list of 10 people so I don&#8217;t get locked into a static channel?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/">BloggerCon</a> is under way this morning. I&#8217;m over at my apartment listening to the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">ITConversations</a> cast instead of heading over to Stanford. I might wander over at some point, but this morning started with a mad dash to peice back together <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/">Elle&#8217;s blog</a> from SQL dumps. Never fun. So I think I&#8217;m just going to sit here and drink coffee and watch what goes through in IRC for a while (#bloggercon on freenode.net).</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s come through the pipe so far? Everyone seemed to love the comments that <a href="http://www.theworld.org/about/bios/kahn.shtml">Tony Kahn</a> made when he introduced himself. He&#8217;s over there and interested in talking about the intersection of blogging type activities and the future of Public Broadcasting. Tag your photos in <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> as &#8216;bloggercon&#8217; so that we can see them <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bloggercon">in the tag listing</a>. Kevin Marks dropped in <a href="http://www.technorati.com/live/topmp3s.html">a Technorati link giving most talked about MP3s</a>. The bloggercon sessions should show up there once they get uploaded.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went over to the <a href="http://www.baychi.org/bof/mobile/20041028/">BayCHI presentation on Mobile Media Metadata</a> last week. Fantastic stuff. Marc Davis from <a href="http://garage.sims.berkeley.edu/">Garage Cinema Research</a> spoke about <a href="http://garage.sims.berkeley.edu/research.cfm">the research they have going on</a>. The presentation he gave focused mostly on mobile metadata. For now lets just talk about images. One of the points he made was that image classification systems tended to focus completely on the image itself. They look at a stream of bits and either attempt to determine the content of the image or attempt to fufill queries based entirely on those bits. But with the source of photo content increasingly being connected mobile devices, there&#8217;s potentially a much richer source of info than the bits themselves. The temporal and spatial information can potentially tell the system a lot more about an image than can be inferred from the image itself. Add in some social aspects, such as &#8220;what have others who have taken pictures in approximately this location used as the subject of their photos&#8221;, and the system can infer quite a bit.</p>

<p>This is one of the aspects that&#8217;s missing from the wider practice of blogging. Efforts like GeoURL started getting me looking in this direction. And most recently the buzz around <a href="http://www.plazes.com/">Plazes</a> got me looking back. There really should be a general distributed system for looking at information in the blogosphere based on time and location. Right now our main methods of organization are social (or something like it). Most people read someones blog, they&#8217;re picking people who have interests that mirror what they want to hear about and subscribing to those feeds. There are plenty of topical blogs, which helps to refine that subscription list somewhat. But that&#8217;s decomposition based on taxonomy (or folksonomy). That works great for getting news, but that&#8217;s only one potential pattern for information flow. The whole flashmob thing popped up and died down pretty quick, but there were a few nuggets in there that we probably shouldn&#8217;t ignore. Such as information flow around a particular event at a particular time in a particular location. How do you arrange information around an event like this? Seems like it would be a pretty common problem. One that&#8217;s likely to get more and more common with an increase in mobile usage. But right now there&#8217;s really not a great answer to it. Shared blogs are setup for events that get planned well in advance. But even there the support doesn&#8217;t seem to fit the pattern that I think most users would like.</p>

<p>When I first heard about the trackback mechanism I was hoping that this would provide at least a partial answer. Someone could setup a trackback location for the event and everyone who has something to say would post on their own and register the link with the event trackback. In practice however there are a bunch of issues with that. First off, of course, is that you need to know that trackback location in advance. Then there are technical hurdles with the trackback mechanism not really being understood or tailored for the novice user. It&#8217;s a good idea, but maybe not the best. Ideally we would want everyone to just post their info independently, and have a system that allows us to find all those posts after the fact due to knowing the location and time of the event. In the end, this is really what you probably want for news creation also. Lots of times the news is made because something unexpected happened. One would want those news capturers to be able to just click away and record media, which we consumers could go back and find. I think this is one of the basic building blocks missing right now from blogging. Being able to say something like &#8220;what did people say at the protest last night in Palo Alto&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t have to be based on knowing who the people are who are most likely to have been at the protest. Right now we&#8217;re substituting social information as a proxy for some forms of metadata that we could have direct access to. Social information is certainly a great source, and a fantastic way to organize a system so that it connects people to what they want in the absence of other factors. But before we go too far down that path I think we need to pay a little attention to the other factors that can be used in organizing these information flows. A lot of this information is coming in from the world outside, away from our desks. Just like image analysis, paying attention only to who said it and what the content is ignores some very rich info. There is a world outside, apparently. Lets try to acknowledge it a bit more.</p>
