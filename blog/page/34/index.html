  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mohamed Salem mailed me to say that his article <a href="http://www.eedesign.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=22103383">An introduction to open-source hardware development</a> was published in EEDesign. Congratulations Mohamed and Jamil!! He mailed me a copy while he was still working on it, and I&#8217;ve been anxiously awaiting the publication so that I pontificate on the subject without trying to lay down some technical details I don&#8217;t know (not that it usually stops me). I have no practical hardware design experience at all. I normally get the stuff after someone else has put it together and now they want it to do something.</p>

<p>Even so, there are some general issues at work here I would like to talk about. The most basic being that it seems like just about everything is becoming software. Desktop tools are software, simulators are software, industrial control systems, payment processing is software, advertising is software, workflow is software. Now, apparently, hardware can be software as well. I&#8217;m not saying that all these functions have been completely replaces with software, but these functions have been trending more and more toward software. The reason often given is that software is relatively easy to change compared to the dedicated function systems and processes that it replaces. Which is kind of funny, considering that the general opinion is also that computer programming is still rather underdeveloped as an engineering field. Or maybe it&#8217;s scary. I&#8217;m not sure which yet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorta fence-sitting on the issue of the general adoption of open source practices by the hardware community in general. I think it would be a great thing. But I think there are a whole different set of dynamics involved in order for it to hit critical mass. One of the reasons that open source hit the ramp was because there were lots of very cheap computers around for people to play with, and the base tools needed were all ready for people to start hacking with those systems right away. Thank you <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Stallman</a>. Thank you <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Tanenbaum</a>. Thank you <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/linus/">Torvalds</a>. The same thing isn&#8217;t really true within the hardware community. Not yet at least, although some people are doing some <a href="http://www.opencollector.org/">great work</a> to try to get there.</p>

<p>Lets suppose that this does happen. Most devices include FPGAs or some like technology. Hardware-as-service is a reality. <a href="http://www.sdrforum.org/">Software defined radio</a> enables your cellphone/pda/laptop to talk to the cellular network, Wifi network, bluetooth devices, wideband home area network, extremely low frequency interplanetary CIA network, whatever you want. What happens then? I can&#8217;t even begin to speculate about the business end of that. I imagine that most hardware manufacturers wouldn&#8217;t be too happy about it. They would be reduced to either very high end systems or selling commoditized hardware substrate.</p>

<p>The concept of shuffling around processing locations by moving around hardware cores in addition to algorithms is interesting, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a compelling reason to move in this direction. I remember the first time I ran across RPC and the promise that it would make scalable processing power available at a low cost. And then the same thing from Java and RMI, and CORBA, and PVM and parallel computing languages, grid computing, web services. I&#8217;ll believe that one when we see it. The limiting factor there doesn&#8217;t seem to be the power of the underlying protocols and scope of the standards, it seems to be our ability to combine them into a meaningful and flexible system.</p>

<p>I do think it could have a pretty drastic effect on the technology adoption curve in general however. Because people wouldn&#8217;t have to buy hardware as often? Kinda. Because it&#8217;s easier to experiment with? Sorta. I think it would change things because it would allow hardware as well as software to propagate in a decentralized fashion. Part of the continued problem with hardware is that it needs to be &#8220;top down&#8221;. This is not the way that software needs to work any more. Take Napster as one example. No one needed to cut deals with distributors and develop sales channels. No one needed to develop a full business plan and secure funding. All that was needed was a good idea and a working set of code. Same thing with Linux. Same thing, to a degree, with GMail. Internet distribution is a major enabler of disruptive change, which is good for innovation and bad for entrenched players. Unfortunately hardware is still tied to the same mechanisms that it relied on to get minicomputers out into a market dominated by mainframes. Which means generally arrogance, luck, and as many fresh college graduates as you can lay your hands on.</p>

<p>Of course, if those kookie new ideas can bundle new hardware designs along with their new software I think we&#8217;re headed for something interesting. Then again, I thought we were headed for something interesting when bluetooth promised to connect all my different devices seamlessly. It&#8217;s not enough to change the world on it&#8217;s own, but it&#8217;s certainly a great enabling factor.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just finished up the <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/07/revised-schedule-for-saturday-meet-up.html">pre-forum forum meeting of the Bay Area Mobility Forum (BAMF)</a>. I hung around to drink more cause, well, I have a GPRS connection and it&#8217;s nice out :-) The meeting was actually really good. What we&#8217;ve decided to do is have a few relatively low-key events. One a month, for three or four months. Each time we&#8217;ll have a main topic, but have an &#8220;open mic&#8221; time when anyone who attends can harangue the audience about pretty much whatever they want (time limit in effect of course). The hope is that over the course of a couple of months we&#8217;ll manage to build up a bit of an audience, &#8220;build up critical mass&#8221; so to speak. And at that point we&#8217;ll plan for an event which has a format more like a standard conference. Multiple sessions on a number of topics. It was universally felt that we would like to bring together people from all the different part of the equation (technical, business, developers, manufacturers, standards organizations, carriers, end-users, etc) and provide a way for them to interact. But first we need to build up a group, which is best done in a more intimate setting than a conference normally affords. All in all, a very hopeful meeting. My sincere thanks to Ted, Erik, Spencer, and Russ for coming out to set down an outline for what I hope will grow to be a great community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a bunch about what makes people contribute to shared online systems. I mean both public systems like wikis or shared blogs, and private systems like a corporate mailing list or intranet site. <a href="http://www.communitywiki.org">CommunityWiki</a> has lots of great information about this topic in general. There are a bunch of issues with long standing projects that seem to be pretty difficult to tackle. How do new members get acquainted and start contributing without demanding too much of their time for startup? With some open online projects, you actually want this &#8220;barrier to entry&#8221; for new members. You want them to self select by requiring that they dedicate some time to at least understand the norms and conventions. If they don&#8217;t understand the norms they are easier to ignore. So this is one of the potential filters, keeping out people who aren&#8217;t genuinely interested in the topic by way of making them easy to spot and ignore.</p>

<p>But what if you aren&#8217;t running an open project? What if the system you&#8217;re setting up is meant to be used within a corporation. Normally you want to remove that barrier to entry. You just want to get everyone up and running quickly, and rely on everyones membership in the same organization to to ensure that they aren&#8217;t there to just be disruptive. If you end up with everyone working together without them going through an acclimation procedure things tend to devolve into chaos more quickly. The joining procedure for newbies serves to provide the set of spontaneous process.</p>

<p>The answer would seem to be to provide process for the corporate version. But what that ends up doing is designating a smaller group who are then perceived to own the wiki. The other members tend to be less involved, less creative, and more resistant to the process. What we would like is an evolved shared process for the corporate case. But providing a mechanism for that when you want everyone assigned to contribute can&#8217;t involve much forced overhead. People will just get frusterated and walk away.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that designating a central manager (or management group) is the only way to do it. There must be some other way to get people working together when they have a shared goal.</p>

I do miss some of the features of Nautilus, like correct as you go spellcheck (not sure what the name for the feature is, where there&#8217;s a colored underline under misspelled words as you type). But there is also some coolness that I didn&#8217;t expect. For instance, <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/">Enigmail</a>, a plugin that adds easy encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify using GPG.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a lot of talk lately about trying to get Sun to open source Java (my personal <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/01/sun_open_source_java/">favorite article is at theRegister</a>). The arguments are good on both sides, and the debates have brought to light some areas that aren&#8217;t very well explored. I don&#8217;t care all that much about Java, it&#8217;s not one of my preferred languages. But the question of &#8220;why open source?&#8221; is an interesting one in general. I think I agree with the ideas that <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/p/calEvent.asp?CID=1175&amp;mo=10&amp;yr=2003">Mitch Kapor spoke about at an SDForum event</a>, that open source is the best way to keep software development honest. During the dotcom bubble lots of companies were able to rapidly suck insane amounts of money out of the economy. They&#8217;re extreme examples, but really that&#8217;s what goes on with most software companies. Software companies need to create artificial barriers to protect their competitive advantage. They need to protect their margins. Depending on the techniques used to do that it can result is software which is radically overpriced. Open source is one method for trying to correct this problem with the market.</p>

<p>Although some like the idea of free software, what they tend to start waving their arms about at this point in the discussion is that open source is &#8220;risky&#8221;. I&#8217;ve come to understand over time that what they really mean is that they don&#8217;t have enough existing experiences with open source for them to be able to make the decision without thinking. Perhaps this is one of the final defense mechanisms of the software market to protect high margins. The problems in analyzing open source mostly stem from the lack of the &#8221;<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/">free rider</a>&#8221; problem that&#8217;s normally associated with a resource held in common. As a communal resource which doesn&#8217;t suffer from depletion, open source apparently obeys some laws which people don&#8217;t fully understand yet. Their answer is normally that they would rather use something they understand than something they don&#8217;t understand but which might be better. Like Joel explains in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">his explanation of commoditizing complements</a>, people should be generally happy when the stuff they have to use or their users have to get decreases in cost.</p>

<p>But this doesn&#8217;t hold true. Apparently &#8220;risk&#8221; is as big a factor in business decisions as price is (where &#8220;risk&#8221; is defined as &#8220;presence of preexisting data on this topic&#8221;). And on top of that, for some reason the pricing function includes a discontinuity at 0. I keep hearing over and over that people want to pay lots of money sometimes. It makes them feel safe and secure. I would have guessed it made them feel shafted, but hey, that&#8217;s just me and my wild and crazy rational mind. Not all in sync with the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>So where does that put us with regard to the whole &#8220;should Java be open sourced?&#8221; issue. Unfortunately, the answer is &#8220;fuck no!!!&#8221; Java should not be open sourced. All that would do is kill it in the marketplace. The market is not ready for open source really. There are some projects that have done a great job of pushing out the initial boundaries (BIND, the GNU compiler, Linux, Apache, etc.), but the market needs time to figure out what to do with these mutations and adapt to them. Free markets, like evolution, take time to make sense of the stimulus they&#8217;re receiving. So the best thing to do for now is to let Sun keep the reigns for Java. It&#8217;ll allow the other unevolved companies see it as something they can understand, measure, and include in themselves.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a really painful thing to have to say, being as rabid of an open source advocate as I am. So of course, the next logical question for me is how can we speed up this adoption process? I would really like to be living in a world where all my technogeek toys run software that I can hack. So how do I scratch my own itch and change the world? That&#8217;s the question that has me writing a blog entry at 4am instead of sleeping. So if you have an answer, please let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I signed up on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> a while ago, and just started adding some bookmarks to it today. I read through the docs page and was going to post about it, but I found an excellent <a href="http://edtech.teacherhosting.com/archives/000109.php">post on edtech.teacherhosting.com</a> describing the principles quite well. I hadn&#8217;t noticed the inbox feature before. If you&#8217;re logged in and viewing someone else&#8217;s bookmarks, you have an option to subscribe to them. Your inbox is a set of bookmarks from the people who you&#8217;ve subscribed to. Much more social than I thought initially from just looking at the front page. I thought it would just provide a way to store my bookmarks in a central place. I had created a <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">linkblog</a> to collect quick links of passing interest that I might want to refer back to later. del.icio.us is a great way to do that instead. All I need to do is setup a mail to del.icio.us gateway so that I can use the &#8220;mail this article&#8221; option to setup bookmarks from my phone (this has ended up being realy handy in lots of instances).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a set of posts all <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/07/01/a_conversation_on_blog_research.php">linked together at Many2Many</a> about research on blogging. It&#8217;s an interesting thread, even if I do think that academic research about blogging is a bit of an odd topic. One point I will bring up is that traditional methods are not set in stone. Elijah says at one point that the discussion that goes on in blog posts and trackback&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the same as formal peer review. I can see the point there, but I think I disagree. I&#8217;m not an academic, so perhaps I&#8217;m missing some nuance to the meaning there. But I am a software developer, and we have a strong parallel experience in open source. Open source software has made a very strong case for an informal process open the public being at least on par with a formal process. Maybe if the blog based methods of communication aren&#8217;t living up to the old methods, we&#8217;re just not doing them quite correctly yet. I have every expectation that those issues will get worked through at some point, and future modes of communication will look a lot more like blogging (or at least borrow heavily from this set of mechanisms we&#8217;re evolving now).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is what appears to be a very insightful article <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100823">over at TheFeature</a> about what is traditionally called the &#8220;triple play&#8221; of services: voice, data, and video. I heard a decent amount about that coupling of services when I was working with companies trying to structure deals with telcos and ISPs. I know it&#8217;s something that people at these organizations are paying attention to. But I never quite put the push to get TV on handsets together with the general principles of the coupling of services. Put in that light I can see why they would be going for something like this. I&#8217;m not really sure that it&#8217;s valid overall, but it certainly does reframe the effort. And if we ignore the short term issues and look at the pie in the sky, there might be a workable model in there somewhere. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that long term technologies should be forced on the public before either the public or the technology is ready for them. The analysis is great, but although I now might understand the telco position a little better I don&#8217;t excuse them for their behavior towards their customers and potential application innovators.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P4470_0_3_0_C">Disruptive Innovation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P4471_0_1_0_C">Resolving the &#8220;Nasty Bit&#8221; in Innovation Strategy</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>This in particular caught my attention (from &#8220;Disruptive Innovation&#8221;):</p>

<blockquote><p>I think we see companies in various places where they&#8217;re making innovations, but they&#8217;re not necessarily engineering-led innovations. They&#8217;re in the products. They&#8217;re often converting a product into a service. They&#8217;re typically marketing led. They tend to be at the surface of the product rather than at the core.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mirra Server: nobody went, &#8220;Gee, I wonder how they did that.&#8221; That was not what was unique about the Mirra server. What&#8217;s unique about the Mirra server is there weren&#8217;t the 27 little wires hanging out the side of the experience. It was a consumerized experience. That&#8217;s a continuous innovation, not a discontinuous innovation. Continuous innovation going forward, marketing led.</p>

<p>These two posts are supposed to be the first of a four part series covering the <a href="http://www.churchillclub.org/eventDetail.jsp?EVT_ID=611">Silicon Valley 4.0 Conference</a> which happened in October of last year. If I catch the other parts as they go by I&#8217;ll add them in.</p>

<p>Update July 13, 2004: <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P4472_0_1_0_C">Part 3</a> has been posted.</p>
