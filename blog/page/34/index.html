  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a lot of talk lately about trying to get Sun to open source Java (my personal <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/01/sun_open_source_java/">favorite article is at theRegister</a>). The arguments are good on both sides, and the debates have brought to light some areas that aren&#8217;t very well explored. I don&#8217;t care all that much about Java, it&#8217;s not one of my preferred languages. But the question of &#8220;why open source?&#8221; is an interesting one in general. I think I agree with the ideas that <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/p/calEvent.asp?CID=1175&amp;mo=10&amp;yr=2003">Mitch Kapor spoke about at an SDForum event</a>, that open source is the best way to keep software development honest. During the dotcom bubble lots of companies were able to rapidly suck insane amounts of money out of the economy. They&#8217;re extreme examples, but really that&#8217;s what goes on with most software companies. Software companies need to create artificial barriers to protect their competitive advantage. They need to protect their margins. Depending on the techniques used to do that it can result is software which is radically overpriced. Open source is one method for trying to correct this problem with the market.</p>

<p>Although some like the idea of free software, what they tend to start waving their arms about at this point in the discussion is that open source is &#8220;risky&#8221;. I&#8217;ve come to understand over time that what they really mean is that they don&#8217;t have enough existing experiences with open source for them to be able to make the decision without thinking. Perhaps this is one of the final defense mechanisms of the software market to protect high margins. The problems in analyzing open source mostly stem from the lack of the &#8221;<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/">free rider</a>&#8221; problem that&#8217;s normally associated with a resource held in common. As a communal resource which doesn&#8217;t suffer from depletion, open source apparently obeys some laws which people don&#8217;t fully understand yet. Their answer is normally that they would rather use something they understand than something they don&#8217;t understand but which might be better. Like Joel explains in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">his explanation of commoditizing complements</a>, people should be generally happy when the stuff they have to use or their users have to get decreases in cost.</p>

<p>But this doesn&#8217;t hold true. Apparently &#8220;risk&#8221; is as big a factor in business decisions as price is (where &#8220;risk&#8221; is defined as &#8220;presence of preexisting data on this topic&#8221;). And on top of that, for some reason the pricing function includes a discontinuity at 0. I keep hearing over and over that people want to pay lots of money sometimes. It makes them feel safe and secure. I would have guessed it made them feel shafted, but hey, that&#8217;s just me and my wild and crazy rational mind. Not all in sync with the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>So where does that put us with regard to the whole &#8220;should Java be open sourced?&#8221; issue. Unfortunately, the answer is &#8220;fuck no!!!&#8221; Java should not be open sourced. All that would do is kill it in the marketplace. The market is not ready for open source really. There are some projects that have done a great job of pushing out the initial boundaries (BIND, the GNU compiler, Linux, Apache, etc.), but the market needs time to figure out what to do with these mutations and adapt to them. Free markets, like evolution, take time to make sense of the stimulus they&#8217;re receiving. So the best thing to do for now is to let Sun keep the reigns for Java. It&#8217;ll allow the other unevolved companies see it as something they can understand, measure, and include in themselves.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a really painful thing to have to say, being as rabid of an open source advocate as I am. So of course, the next logical question for me is how can we speed up this adoption process? I would really like to be living in a world where all my technogeek toys run software that I can hack. So how do I scratch my own itch and change the world? That&#8217;s the question that has me writing a blog entry at 4am instead of sleeping. So if you have an answer, please let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I signed up on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> a while ago, and just started adding some bookmarks to it today. I read through the docs page and was going to post about it, but I found an excellent <a href="http://edtech.teacherhosting.com/archives/000109.php">post on edtech.teacherhosting.com</a> describing the principles quite well. I hadn&#8217;t noticed the inbox feature before. If you&#8217;re logged in and viewing someone else&#8217;s bookmarks, you have an option to subscribe to them. Your inbox is a set of bookmarks from the people who you&#8217;ve subscribed to. Much more social than I thought initially from just looking at the front page. I thought it would just provide a way to store my bookmarks in a central place. I had created a <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">linkblog</a> to collect quick links of passing interest that I might want to refer back to later. del.icio.us is a great way to do that instead. All I need to do is setup a mail to del.icio.us gateway so that I can use the &#8220;mail this article&#8221; option to setup bookmarks from my phone (this has ended up being realy handy in lots of instances).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a set of posts all <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/07/01/a_conversation_on_blog_research.php">linked together at Many2Many</a> about research on blogging. It&#8217;s an interesting thread, even if I do think that academic research about blogging is a bit of an odd topic. One point I will bring up is that traditional methods are not set in stone. Elijah says at one point that the discussion that goes on in blog posts and trackback&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the same as formal peer review. I can see the point there, but I think I disagree. I&#8217;m not an academic, so perhaps I&#8217;m missing some nuance to the meaning there. But I am a software developer, and we have a strong parallel experience in open source. Open source software has made a very strong case for an informal process open the public being at least on par with a formal process. Maybe if the blog based methods of communication aren&#8217;t living up to the old methods, we&#8217;re just not doing them quite correctly yet. I have every expectation that those issues will get worked through at some point, and future modes of communication will look a lot more like blogging (or at least borrow heavily from this set of mechanisms we&#8217;re evolving now).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is what appears to be a very insightful article <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100823">over at TheFeature</a> about what is traditionally called the &#8220;triple play&#8221; of services: voice, data, and video. I heard a decent amount about that coupling of services when I was working with companies trying to structure deals with telcos and ISPs. I know it&#8217;s something that people at these organizations are paying attention to. But I never quite put the push to get TV on handsets together with the general principles of the coupling of services. Put in that light I can see why they would be going for something like this. I&#8217;m not really sure that it&#8217;s valid overall, but it certainly does reframe the effort. And if we ignore the short term issues and look at the pie in the sky, there might be a workable model in there somewhere. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that long term technologies should be forced on the public before either the public or the technology is ready for them. The analysis is great, but although I now might understand the telco position a little better I don&#8217;t excuse them for their behavior towards their customers and potential application innovators.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two recent posts from Always On:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P4470_0_3_0_C">Disruptive Innovation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P4471_0_1_0_C">Resolving the &#8220;Nasty Bit&#8221; in Innovation Strategy</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>This in particular caught my attention (from &#8220;Disruptive Innovation&#8221;):</p>

<blockquote><p>I think we see companies in various places where they&#8217;re making innovations, but they&#8217;re not necessarily engineering-led innovations. They&#8217;re in the products. They&#8217;re often converting a product into a service. They&#8217;re typically marketing led. They tend to be at the surface of the product rather than at the core.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mirra Server: nobody went, &#8220;Gee, I wonder how they did that.&#8221; That was not what was unique about the Mirra server. What&#8217;s unique about the Mirra server is there weren&#8217;t the 27 little wires hanging out the side of the experience. It was a consumerized experience. That&#8217;s a continuous innovation, not a discontinuous innovation. Continuous innovation going forward, marketing led.</p>

<p>These two posts are supposed to be the first of a four part series covering the <a href="http://www.churchillclub.org/eventDetail.jsp?EVT_ID=611">Silicon Valley 4.0 Conference</a> which happened in October of last year. If I catch the other parts as they go by I&#8217;ll add them in.</p>

<p>Update July 13, 2004: <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P4472_0_1_0_C">Part 3</a> has been posted.</p>

<p>Update July 21, 2004: <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P4481_0_4_0_C">Part 4</a> has been posted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100786&amp;ref=1598815">post over at TheFeature</a> about trying to get the traditional news business to adapt to mobile information delivery. I know my own experiences are probably way out of line with the norm, but I&#8217;ve built up a little list of feeds that I can scan when I&#8217;ve got a few minutes worth of time. My mobile feeds are the ones that provide the best summary versions (or have very short entries to begin with), and I scan through them with my phone. If I find something interesting, I email the link to myself so that I can check up on the full version when I get back to my computer. Not perfect, but it works out pretty well.</p>

<p>This might be one of the areas that best illustrates a possible shift in focus from mass media to small publishers. Although I haven&#8217;t read the book yet, I did go to hear <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan Gillmor</a> talk about his new book <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/05/17/we_the_media_by_dan_gillmor.html">We The Media</a>. In the book he talks about small publishers starting to cut into the area currently held by larger media outlets. One of the advantages that smaller producers do have is that they can provide content which is more tailored. Any given consumer can then assemble the feed that they want out of a number of different smaller channels. While big media is facing an issue in terms of being able to provide specialized and tailored content, the same issue might not be faced by smaller producers. There are other issues with the small producers model, I&#8217;m not saying that it looks perfect so far. But it certainly seems that aggregating multiple small feeds from grassroots bloggers is a better starting model of mobile news delivery than trying to get major content publishers to publish in multiple formats and customize their feed.</p>

<p>Additionally, some of the issues that are commonly sighted with the grassroots movement might not really be issues at all. Many of the arguments echo those that we heard at the start of the open source movement, and those issues have proven to pale in comparison to the benefits. There might have to be some major tweaks to the system as time goes on, but there certainly seem to be some strong correlations between what&#8217;s happening to journalism now and what has happened to software over the last 10 years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just re-reading a couple of articles by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.C.R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a>. They&#8217;re only <a href="http://memex.org/licklider.pdf">available as PDF</a> as far as I&#8217;ve seen, sorry about that. In particular the second article, &#8220;Computer as Communication Device&#8221;, really struck me as a discussion about <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/supernova/index.cgi?roundtable_closing_the_back_channel_loop">&#8220;the backchannel&#8221;</a> that appears commonly at technical conferences these days. Take a look at the section called &#8220;Face to face through a computer&#8221; and I think you&#8217;ll see that Licklider and Taylor are talking about much the same phenomenon as we witness today, except they were talking about it back in 1968. This is a quote from that section of the paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>So the meeting began much like any other meeting in the sense that there was an overall list of agenda and that each speaker had brought with him (figuratively in his briefcase but really within the computer) the material he would be talking about.</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>The computer system was a significant aid in exploring the depth and breadth of the material. More detailed information could be displayed when facts had to be pinpointed; more global information could be displayed to answer questions of relevance and interrelationship. A future version of this system will make it possible for each participant, on his own TV screen, to thumb through the speaker's files as the speaker talks--and thus check out incidental questions without interrupting the presentation for substantiation.
</code></pre>

<p>I think that&#8217;s just amazing. I&#8217;m sure someone has called out this connection before. But I couldn&#8217;t find mention of it anywhere so I&#8217;m posting it on my own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m playing the home edition of <a href="http://www.pulver.com/supernova/">Supernova 2004</a>. Listening to the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/supernova2004.html">audio streams</a>, watching the <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/supernova/index.cgi?supernova_wiki">Wiki</a> for updates, keeping an eye on the <a href="http://snblog.pulver.com/2004/">metablog</a>, and chatting on the IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. The term used to refer to dealing with all the incoming information is <a href="http://supernova.typepad.com/2004/2004/06/continuous_part.html">continuous partial attention</a>. I always think of one of the main characters from <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/idoru.asp">Idoru</a> when I try to describe it. Gibson is always so oddly apt in his characterizations. One of the characters is a researcher who can spot some kind of metapatterns in large amounts of raw data to pull out the information that he wants. It&#8217;s something like letting your eyes unfocus and just trying to spot anything changing in your entire field of view, except that you have multiple streams of input instead of a unified field to take into account. It&#8217;s an amusing exercise for anyone interested in computer interfaces. Apparently you can pass the information saturation point of an interface and still provide meaningful information if you split it into multiple channels that can be processed in parallel. Assuming whoever this information is aimed at can operate in &#8220;continuous partial attention mode&#8221;.</p>
