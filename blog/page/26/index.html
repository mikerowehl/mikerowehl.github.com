  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the questions I&#8217;ve been asked by a number of people since joining <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> is &#8220;Are Technorati and Feedster competitors?&#8221; (or &#8220;Is there a difference between Feedster and Technorati?&#8221; or something along those lines). I was going to write up something to explain my take, but it looks like Dave Sifry over at <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> has been seeing the same kinds of questions and decided to <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000268.html">answer publicly</a>. So I&#8217;m just going to build off Dave&#8217;s statements, in particular the part about:</p>

<blockquote><p>So please, continue to use the fine services from Feedster and PubSub! And please continue to try out and use Technorati watchlists as well. May a thousand flowers bloom.</p></blockquote>

<p>People ask questions about the two companies being competitors because there is a lot of overlap in what we do, we provide a lot of the same kinds of features. There are differences, but in general they tend to be rather esoteric and mostly of interest to the geeks. Currently the most major differences are in terms of outlook. I&#8217;ve personally thought of Technorati as building a new thing called a &#8220;conversation engine&#8221;, used to track conversations happening online. Whereas Feedster is a news search engine. Check out the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/about/">Technorati about page</a> and the <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/overview/index.html">Feedster overview page</a>. To me there&#8217;s an obvious difference there, a difference in focus at the very least.</p>

<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t see it. Or maybe you think it doesn&#8217;t really matter. &#8220;What difference does an outlook make if the features are the same?&#8221; one might ask (and they have). The important point to remember here is that we&#8217;re at the start of a very new and rapidly expanding market. It might look like Technorati and Feedster (and <a href="http://www.pubsub.com">PubSub</a>**) are currently crowded into a small area, but that area is getting larger and larger every day. As the market as a whole grows the conceptual differences between Technorati and Feedster will turn into concrete differences in functionality. We still might end up competing in some areas, but there will be plenty of pie to go around. So my overall answer is no, I don&#8217;t consider Technorati a competitor. We&#8217;re both working toward the same goal of growing the use of blogging and related technologies, working to make sure that readers and writers have what&#8217;s necessary to keep the growth going. It&#8217;s too early to know what the board will look like once the growth stops accelerating. Yes, that&#8217;s right, I said &#8220;stops accelerating&#8221;. It was intentional.</p>

<p>** about PubSub - I say Technorati and Feedster, but PubSub really should be included in this as well. One major difference is that I think PubSub is already pretty well differentiated. I used Technorati because it was Dave&#8217;s note that kicked off the response, and because most of the people I&#8217;ve spoken to ask directly about Technorati. Personally I use all three to track the topics I&#8217;m interested in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Howard has posted a manifesto titled <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101299&amp;ref=5062836">Mobile and Open</a>, so I&#8217;m going to take this chance to jump in and reframe some of the stuff I&#8217;ve said along these lines before. I think it&#8217;s a great topic, and most people misinterpret what I mean when I say that there must be more openness to the mobile infrastructure. So now that we have a great touchpoint in the writeup from Howard I want to run thru a few things.</p>

<p>First is the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=275">Mobile Data Services and Innovation</a> post. The idea here is that innovation normally comes from the bottom up, not the top down. The example that Howard gave of Tim Berners-Lee is excellent. This is not a universal truth I don&#8217;t think, but very often new solutions have come from people who were able to put together a solution to their own problem without having to make sweeping changes in order to do so. It&#8217;s normally only after the solution has been out in the wild for a bit that users of the current dominant system catch on to the utility of the new system. I won&#8217;t belabour the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=350">reasons behind why the providers of the previous system might even be hostile towards the new system</a>, we&#8217;ve covered that before. I personally believe that the ability of open source to avoid this problem (the current install base being controlled by a hostile entrenched provider) is one of the major reasons for long-term success of open source. The same thing is very true in the mobile environment.  Once a provider assembles their &#8220;stack&#8221; of solutions they become resistant to changing it. That&#8217;s just what their business model requires them to do in most cases. When the providers become resistant to change the environment as a whole stagnates and innovation slows down to a crawl. Keeping the environment open, and allowing the users of the system to potentially act as innovators without requiring them to get the help of providers, is the way to make sure that progress moves at the pace of the market.  Otherwise the market only moves as fast as the telcos want it to.</p>

<p>The points about open innovation commons and the ability to organize ad-hoc networks are pretty closely tied together in my view. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=275">commented on the need for making mobile services more end-to-end</a> in the post already linked above, as well as the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=329">need to evolve beyond the established online equivalents in some cases</a>. The flexibility of the layered system that is TCP/IP is what has helped keep the Internet the thriving diverse environment that it is. No one needs to rip out routers and switching equiptment on the Internet in order to deploy a new application, all applications exist on top of a common basic set of capabilities.  And as much as possible the equipment between the two ends of an exchange need to know nothing about the content and meaning of that exchange. This is not true in the mobile environment. Although some services in mobility run over TCP/IP style infrastructure, there are plenty that are proprietary and explicitly embedded in the network. I am 100% convinced that the long term benefit of mobility itself would be best served by adopting an infrastructure that models this end to end principle seen in  the architecture of the Internet. Does that mean straight TCP/IP? No of course not, service layers need to be added to the base TCP/IP stack to provide the kinds of features that mobility makes possible. But those features should be added levels on top of a common base, and not modification of the fundamental layers. I think this would also spur innovation in mobility the same way that we saw an explosion in online activity in the early 90s. Right now we&#8217;re seeing pale reflections of online services for the most part. True mobile specific applications seem to be almost accidents (take SMS for example). The efforts to translate online activity into mobile activity and to evolve one mobile activity into another are just small bits of what could be done if the community was allowed to be self serving. I know there are fantastic applications out there waiting to be discovered. The current infrastructure doesn&#8217;t allow them to be deployed as is, and the existing incumbents won&#8217;t understand them until they see the applications in action. The only way to break the deadlock is an open environment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fooling around a bit with the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=377">Feedster feed info API</a> I was looking for a way to export Firefox bookmarks as OPML and then use the feed info API to fill in the feeds associated with bookmarked web pages. There&#8217;s <a href="http://syncmarks.mozdev.org/">a bookmark extension</a> which apparently will output in XBEL. But in my opinion even just asking users to install an extension is too much. People should be able to export their bookmarks from the stock tool and upload the file to an aggie or online service to bootstrap their subscriptions. From what I&#8217;ve seen this is where the standard users are living right now. Some are using portal services, but not all. And those who are using portals normally have some info they still read outside of the portal. They have their favorites bookmarked, and they run through their bookmarks reading news. We can figure out if there are feeds associated with the pages they have tagged, there should be an automatic process for this. Sorting through sites and looking for XML buttons and cutting and pasting URLs is a pain in the ass, and that assumes a level of knowledge that I&#8217;m not seeing in the non-geek crowd I&#8217;ve been chatting with lately. Anyone know of tools or services that do the conversion?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been having trouble with uploads to both <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.buzznet.com">BuzzNet</a> during this vacation. I uploaded images the day I left for NY, and everything worked at 12:30pm PST. Then I landed in NY and tried an upload using the same phone using the same settings to the same accounts, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be working any more. And everyone is gone for the holidays it seems, so self service it is. I didn&#8217;t have the OBEX bluetooth tools setup under Linux (I&#8217;m currently using Gentoo on my laptop). I&#8217;ve tried to install the slick-as-hell-sounding gnome-bluetooth package, but I can&#8217;t emerge it. Error compiling. So I went tooling around looking for simple bare bones shims so that I could just move some data around. Not all that much out there.  I have GPRS working over bluetooth for this laptop and phone, so I know the basics are working. But how about accessing the data on the phone itself? Not good, here&#8217;s some info.</p>

<p>I grabbed the <a href="http://oss.bdit.de/opd.html">OBEX push daemon</a> and installed that.  First I had to install the deprecated bluez-sdp package under Gentoo, but OPD compiled and worked fine after I set it up. Last release of this package was during 2003.  Wow!!! Is everyone else using Bluetooth under Linux using gnome-bluetooth to handle inbound pushes? I didn&#8217;t really find much else that would do it. OPD worked great for getting images off my phone, sending from the phone. I wasn&#8217;t able to get file transfer working, I assumed that I should be able to use obexftp to browse and get/put files from my laptop, but no go. I try any command line and it just seems to fail. None of the info I found online says that special effort is required, but I get errors trying to list anything at all:</p>

<blockquote><p>miker@whirr src $ obexftp -b 00:60:57:8A:E7:5B -B 10 -l /
No custom transport
Connecting&#8230;bt: 1
failed: S45 UUID
done
Receiving /&#8230; failed:
Disconnecting&#8230;done
miker@whirr src $</p></blockquote>

<p>I also couldn&#8217;t get the get function using <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/openobex/openobex-apps-1.0.0.tar.gz">OpenOBEX-apps</a> working either. Does OBEX file transfer expose a different namespace for files than something like <a href="http://www.newlc.com/article.php3?id_article=70">FExplorer</a> does? Should any of these applications work? Pushes over OBEX are all I&#8217;ve ever really gotten working. Does OBEX file transfer just suck too much for anyone to ever get it working? I thought the Windows Bluetooth drivers normally allowed browsing and access to the info on the phone. I doubt the Windows users are typing in magic paths&#8230; so this should be technically possible. Anyone know of a simple ftp style app to access a Series60 phone (or any OBEX capable device) from Linux?  And if not, anyone know if it&#8217;s possible to do without installing an app on the phone? I&#8217;ll write it if the app doesn&#8217;t already exist, I just don&#8217;t feel like pouring time into figuring out that the underlying technologies are too broken to get this working.</p>

<p>I was also looking for how to push files from the laptop to the phone, and I found lots of people pointing to my old site, unrooted.net, which is no longer up. I need to put that back, but in the meantime I put up <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ussp-push-0.2.tgz">the ussp-push</a> package here at Bitsplitter. It has an obextool command line app that does a push from a Linux system out to a device that accepts OBEX push. You can also use obex_test from the openobex-apps package. Here&#8217;s an example of pushing an image from my laptop to my 6600 using that package:</p>

<blockquote><p>miker@whirr src $ ./obex_test -b 00:60:57:8A:E7:5B 10
