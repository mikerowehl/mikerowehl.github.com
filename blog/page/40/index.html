  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across a great blog today called <a href="http://asynchronousdialogue.blogspot.com/">Asynchronous Dialogue</a>. In particular I want to comment on a post there titled <a href="http://asynchronousdialogue.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_asynchronousdialogue_archive.html#108164258451291620">What is dialogue?</a> I really liked this:</p>

<blockquote><p>What begins to make less sense is treating dialogue as if it were a practice. In other words creating scenarios like: dialogue > purpose > understanding or, dialogue > understanding. This, of course, is every teacher&#8217;s fantasy!</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s also the fantasy of requirements gathering during software development. I agree completely that practice needs to occur early in that chain of progress. This is the reason that I&#8217;ve been on this big prototyping quest for the last few years. Until you start doing, you don&#8217;t start understanding. In that post Chris says that talking during shared practice acts as &#8220;a kind of carrier wave of understanding&#8221;. The goal in prototyping is to move as much of the dialog from speech into the model itself, so that communication is increasingly occurring through the model instead of around it. Spoken dialog is a good way to start out, but too imprecise to facilitate understanding. I hope that&#8217;s what Chris is saying at least, cause I agree completely :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>SmartMobs <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/003023.html">reports on a free (and soon to be open source) urban social landscapes tool</a>. The tool is a release from Intel, available as J2ME using MIDP but soon to be open source. Based on the <a href="http://www.urban-atmospheres.net/Jabberwocky/info.htm">info page</a> the sensing pattern seems to be based on Bluetooth. Very interesting. Here&#8217;s one of the many tidbits from the site which caught my attention:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the most powerful elements of Jabberwocky is that it is not driven by the bits of an online network, but by actual real-life daily ebb and flow within our actual urban landscapes - by the movement and interaction (or non-interaction) of others who&#8217;s path we encounter.  Therefore, the number of &#8220;participants&#8221; is not simply the size of some database on a central server but a more powerful, grass roots, and personal membership in urban life. To be specific, every Bluetooth mobile phone user is within the Jabberwocky &#8220;community&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nice. But like always, I would like to play with this using my PDA. Currently that&#8217;s a PalmOS device.. but it&#8217;s starting to look more and more like there&#8217;s going to be a Linux based device in this role quite soon. Still, if the source gets out there we might see an <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">Open Palm Environment</a> tool to play with this kind of data.</p>

<p>Taking tools like this together with the <a href="http://webs.cs.berkeley.edu/tos/">TinyOS</a> operating system for sensor networks (also a project heavily funded by Intel) there do seem to be some interesting synergies, even if they are quite a ways off. The Jabberwocky (what a GREAT name!) project talks about &#8220;digital scents&#8221; as one potential view of what happens using the app. But with the sensor (cell phone) only in one place, there is only an instantaneous sampling of position. I can see them licking their lips thinking about Jabberwocky enabled motes that users lay down as active markers in their wake. Then the system doesn&#8217;t become like digital makers, they literally are digital markers. Like normal, this is just speculation on my part, but the ideas do seem to mesh quite well. I do not speak for Intel, the baseless speculation provided here is entirely my own, etc, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to include a blogroll version of the site without always putting a big long list my blog all the time. Having a list of users whose blogs you normally read is nice to do because the people who are receiving your readership can look at places like <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> to see who is interested in their posts. I used to think this was just a form of posturing, but I&#8217;m starting to think it&#8217;s more important. It adds one kind of backlink into the system as a whole. It provides a way for a content producer to see a list of everyone interested in what they&#8217;re writing. As laid out in <a href="http://www.blueoxen.org/papers/0000D/">A Manifesto for Collaborative Tools</a>, backlinks are important. The paper talks about document linking, but I think the idea extends to resources in general.</p>

<p>So I created another top level page, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/blogroll.php">Bitsplitter Blogroll</a>. It&#8217;s the same as the normal top level page, except that it has a list of people who I normally read and a copy of the Gnomedex blogroll. It&#8217;s a brute force approach, so I figured there would be no real issues. But for some reason it doesn&#8217;t seem to be getting sucked up by Technorati. So we&#8217;ll have to see how this goes. My plan was to shove pings to Technorati for both URLs into my hacks file for Wordpress, but the whole issue might be moot. I&#8217;ll give it a while and maybe email feedback tomorrow if things still aren&#8217;t looking good. I would really like to sling props where props are due, but I also don&#8217;t want to move a big list of links around to people viewing from PDAs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Still very much rough around the edges, but there&#8217;s a 1.0 release of the download plugin at the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpalmenv/">Open Palm Environment</a> SourceForge site. The project is a plugin for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pilot-db/">Pilot-db</a>, an open source package for Palm handhelds which allows users to create and exchange databases from their PDA. With the plugin installed you can download files in much the same way that the palm-torrent project from the Open Palm Environment project does. Acting as a plugin for pilot-db gives access to a much more extensive set of editing tools on both the PDA and the desktop. I didn&#8217;t want to write a bookmark management system into palm-torrent, so this seemed like a good option. After all, the plugin was one of the original techniques I proposed when <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/hacking/palm/online-repository.html">I first wrote about the idea</a>. The plugin still needs to be cleaned up a bunch, and there needs to be a bunch of databases with pointers to free info and programs (plucker books, open source apps, etc).  I have the prc sitting in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/">projects area at Bitsplitter</a>, so you can download the plugin using the URL <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/db-download.prc">http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/db-download.prc</a> if you have a copy of palm-torrent on your PDA already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jaron Lanier is <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/03/jaron_lanier_up.html">speaking in Palo Alto</a> on Friday April 23rd. The talk is supposed to be an update to <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge74.html">One Half Of A Manifesto</a>, an article written during 2000 in which he examines the beliefs of what he calls &#8220;cybernetic totalism&#8221;. He argues that the belief that Moore&#8217;s law and artificial intelligence will bring about some new class of humanity is just a form of intellectual laziness no more grounded in reality than any other religious dogma. I particularly enjoyed this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Before you tell me that it will be overwhelmingly obvious when the superintelligent new cyber-species arrives, visit a dog show. Or a gathering of people who believe they have been abducted by aliens in UFOs. People are demonstrably insane when it comes to assessing non-human sentience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certainly sounds like an interesting time, especially so because I can&#8217;t really figure out on which side of this debate I lie.</p>

The list is still pretty short (the conf is still a LONG way off :-) but there are already some interesting blogs on there.

An excellent way to find people with like interests before we get out there. There&#8217;s supposed to be an open bar the whole time this year. Making a good impression in advance is necessary so as to preemptively counteract the poor impression that stumbling around spewing technoweenie jargon will make.</p>

The articles themselves are very good, and they led me to <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/index.html">Chicken Scheme</a>, an interesting Scheme implementation I was able to get running on my ancient laptop so I could play with something on the plane trip home. It includes what seems to be an interesting <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/manual/manual-Z-H-51.html#%_chap_7">mechanism to support extension</a>, something I haven&#8217;t seen in other implementations yet.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s some interesting commentary about the difference between licensing software and purchasing it in <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6710">Why Free Software Matters</a>. It&#8217;s certainly easy to forget just how much of what we do with computers actually ends up having a lot of strings attached. I would like to relate the discussion about licenses and open standards back to the Trusted Computing initiative I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=238">brought up again yesterday</a>. There are a lot of points which people respond to with the example that Sean gives: &#8220;So what? I run MS Word/Windows. It does what I want. Why should I care? They can&#8217;t come into my house and take it away from me. Get that microphone out of my face.&#8221; This is the issue with the TCPA that I have. Under the proposed model, they wouldn&#8217;t have to come into your house to take it away. They would be able to make it so that you couldn&#8217;t use the software unless you were using a set of software that the vendor approves of, and it provides mechanisms so that the vendor can switch the functions of the software and disable it at their will. The model makes it so that the vendor not only can keep your information from you by putting it into a format they don&#8217;t give you the details for, but makes it so that they can cryptographically seal you off from your information. The TCPA model builds into the software provisioning system mechanisms to formalize all these protections. Vendors would no longer have to rely on &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221; in their formats and legal protections of licensing, TCPA would provide them with the tools to enforce their desires using the computer architecture. They&#8217;re techniques that the vendors already try to leverage against us, and blessing the behavior by supporting it explicitly is something I feel would just lead to grosser abuses.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an article titled <a href="http://www.totaltele.com/telcorevolutions/bm5.shtml">Separating network and communications infrastructure</a> up at <a href="http://www.totaltele.com/telcorevolutions/">telco revolutions</a>. I happened across the article during some random wandering, but it sums up exactly how I think about providers. Check this out:</p>

<blockquote><p>Organisations should stop searching for killer applications. Instead, they should seek killer business cases that treat networks as an independent resource that is fundamental to developing value-add as well as open standard communications applications while lowering infrastructure total cost of ownership.</p></blockquote>

<p>Right on. I&#8217;ve said things like that before, but I apply the principles to telcom service providers and not just ITOs. I think the argument extends quite well. It&#8217;s the end-to-end principle applied to business models. Making the nodes of a network smart is not very good for the network itself. It&#8217;s better to keep the internal parts of a network dumb and to put all the logic at the edges. It&#8217;s why I think telecoms trying to &#8220;move up the value chain&#8221; with respect to providing data services is a bad idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Intel has formally announced the next version of the XScale series of processors <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1565846,00.asp">according to ExtremeTech</a>. There are some cool features in there, it sounds like a good processor. But what really disturbs me is that Intel calls this the &#8220;Wireless Trusted Platform&#8221;, which I think has to mean that it implements <a href="http://www.trustedcomputing.org/home">the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance</a> specifications for Trusted Computing. It only makes sense, Intel is a founding member of that organization. I&#8217;m not a big fan of trusted computing the way it has been proposed. Sure, there are lots of good applications it could be used for. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://invisiblog.com/1c801df4aee49232/article/0df117d5d9b32aea8bc23194ecc270ec">anonymous blog called Unlimited Freedom</a> (<a href="http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:-TKIk_sivx8J:invisiblog.com/1c801df4aee49232/article/0df117d5d9b32aea8bc23194ecc270ec&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google Cache</a>) which gives some of the beneficial applications that could be built on top of TCPA recommendations. But I think the technology would be used to limit the freedoms of consumers more than it would be used to provide new applications. That&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t think a trusted computing effort wouldn&#8217;t be a welcome addition to the technology menagerie that is the current Internet. I just think that the suggested architecture skews too heavily toward protecting content providers without much consideration for consumer rights. And as <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lessig comments with more eloquence than I</a>, content producers already have a lot of legal protections on their side. Do they really need more mechanism and code protections?</p>

<p>There are some sites opposing the TCPA as well, such as <a href="http://www.againsttcpa.com/">AgainstTCPA.com</a>. I was able to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=130">attend the class on Trusted Computing by Seth Schoen</a> back in January. I think this is an issue that everyone should be educated about, although I have no good option to present for how to do it. Even if you don&#8217;t agree with me, please, go and read some of the info from either side of the debate. Educated people are usually harder to fool. Even if this gets used widely and ends up being an issue, perhaps an educated public will prevent it from being abused too badly.</p>
