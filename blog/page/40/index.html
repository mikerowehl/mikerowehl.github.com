  <div class="entry-content"><p>After seeing the <a href="http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/Week-of-Mon-20040405/000201.html">interview with Ward Cunningham</a> linked to from <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/04/22/ward_on_social_engineering_in_a_wiki.php">a post in Many2Many</a> I started wandering through the <a href="http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/">archives of the luvly mailing list</a>. There&#8217;s some great stuff in there. For instance an <a href="http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/Week-of-Mon-20040322/000197.html">interview with Lion Kimbro</a>, who has released a book titled <a href="http://speakeasy.org/~lion/nb/">How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought you Think</a>. The book looks great, and it&#8217;s released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">Share Alike Creative Commons license</a>. So of course I had to create <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/Lion_Kimbro_Complete_Map.pdb">a Plucker version</a> so I can read it on the go. Trying to download the pdb file using <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">palm-torrent</a> has exposed some kind of bug there as well.. so I&#8217;m off to try to crush that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3649093.stm">interesting article about researchers using touch to convey text messages</a>. An interesting concept. They call it &#8220;tactile melody&#8221;. I would have called it <a href="http://www.braille.org/">braille</a>. Even though they apparently want to use different movements of pins than the letter combinations used by braille. They probably figure they can convey messages more effectively, requiring less attention from the user and less symbol recognitions. Good for them. I&#8217;m not going to say that I know for sure that they&#8217;re reinventing a number of wheels in unison, but I&#8217;ve got a pretty good feeling that they are. I take this for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can assign a certain tactile melody to my wife and another tactile melody to my daughter,&#8221; said Prof Eckmiller.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;If they send me an SMS, I immediately recognise these melodies, because I selected and generated them myself.&#8221;</p>

<p><sarcasm>Just like I always remember where my car keys are because I put them somewhere myself. Ah yes, infinite customization. The non-existent user requirement every developer loves to foist upon the unsuspecting public.</sarcasm> Or maybe they&#8217;re just talking about using these tactile melodies like ringtones? Could be, but that doesn&#8217;t explain how it would allow for reading messages &#8220;under poor lighting conditions&#8221; in &#8220;total privacy&#8221;. And, of course, they&#8217;ve filed patents. Ensuring that just in case there is a nugget of useful sanity they&#8217;ve generated during the extended dance of tactile plagiarism we&#8217;ll probably have to pay through the nose in order to even consider using it. Yay technology!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across a great blog today called <a href="http://asynchronousdialogue.blogspot.com/">Asynchronous Dialogue</a>. In particular I want to comment on a post there titled <a href="http://asynchronousdialogue.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_asynchronousdialogue_archive.html#108164258451291620">What is dialogue?</a> I really liked this:</p>

<blockquote><p>What begins to make less sense is treating dialogue as if it were a practice. In other words creating scenarios like: dialogue > purpose > understanding or, dialogue > understanding. This, of course, is every teacher&#8217;s fantasy!</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s also the fantasy of requirements gathering during software development. I agree completely that practice needs to occur early in that chain of progress. This is the reason that I&#8217;ve been on this big prototyping quest for the last few years. Until you start doing, you don&#8217;t start understanding. In that post Chris says that talking during shared practice acts as &#8220;a kind of carrier wave of understanding&#8221;. The goal in prototyping is to move as much of the dialog from speech into the model itself, so that communication is increasingly occurring through the model instead of around it. Spoken dialog is a good way to start out, but too imprecise to facilitate understanding. I hope that&#8217;s what Chris is saying at least, cause I agree completely :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>SmartMobs <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/003023.html">reports on a free (and soon to be open source) urban social landscapes tool</a>. The tool is a release from Intel, available as J2ME using MIDP but soon to be open source. Based on the <a href="http://www.urban-atmospheres.net/Jabberwocky/info.htm">info page</a> the sensing pattern seems to be based on Bluetooth. Very interesting. Here&#8217;s one of the many tidbits from the site which caught my attention:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the most powerful elements of Jabberwocky is that it is not driven by the bits of an online network, but by actual real-life daily ebb and flow within our actual urban landscapes - by the movement and interaction (or non-interaction) of others who&#8217;s path we encounter.  Therefore, the number of &#8220;participants&#8221; is not simply the size of some database on a central server but a more powerful, grass roots, and personal membership in urban life. To be specific, every Bluetooth mobile phone user is within the Jabberwocky &#8220;community&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nice. But like always, I would like to play with this using my PDA. Currently that&#8217;s a PalmOS device.. but it&#8217;s starting to look more and more like there&#8217;s going to be a Linux based device in this role quite soon. Still, if the source gets out there we might see an <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">Open Palm Environment</a> tool to play with this kind of data.</p>

<p>Taking tools like this together with the <a href="http://webs.cs.berkeley.edu/tos/">TinyOS</a> operating system for sensor networks (also a project heavily funded by Intel) there do seem to be some interesting synergies, even if they are quite a ways off. The Jabberwocky (what a GREAT name!) project talks about &#8220;digital scents&#8221; as one potential view of what happens using the app. But with the sensor (cell phone) only in one place, there is only an instantaneous sampling of position. I can see them licking their lips thinking about Jabberwocky enabled motes that users lay down as active markers in their wake. Then the system doesn&#8217;t become like digital makers, they literally are digital markers. Like normal, this is just speculation on my part, but the ideas do seem to mesh quite well. I do not speak for Intel, the baseless speculation provided here is entirely my own, etc, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to include a blogroll version of the site without always putting a big long list my blog all the time. Having a list of users whose blogs you normally read is nice to do because the people who are receiving your readership can look at places like <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> to see who is interested in their posts. I used to think this was just a form of posturing, but I&#8217;m starting to think it&#8217;s more important. It adds one kind of backlink into the system as a whole. It provides a way for a content producer to see a list of everyone interested in what they&#8217;re writing. As laid out in <a href="http://www.blueoxen.org/papers/0000D/">A Manifesto for Collaborative Tools</a>, backlinks are important. The paper talks about document linking, but I think the idea extends to resources in general.</p>

<p>So I created another top level page, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/blogroll.php">Bitsplitter Blogroll</a>. It&#8217;s the same as the normal top level page, except that it has a list of people who I normally read and a copy of the Gnomedex blogroll. It&#8217;s a brute force approach, so I figured there would be no real issues. But for some reason it doesn&#8217;t seem to be getting sucked up by Technorati. So we&#8217;ll have to see how this goes. My plan was to shove pings to Technorati for both URLs into my hacks file for Wordpress, but the whole issue might be moot. I&#8217;ll give it a while and maybe email feedback tomorrow if things still aren&#8217;t looking good. I would really like to sling props where props are due, but I also don&#8217;t want to move a big list of links around to people viewing from PDAs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Still very much rough around the edges, but there&#8217;s a 1.0 release of the download plugin at the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpalmenv/">Open Palm Environment</a> SourceForge site. The project is a plugin for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pilot-db/">Pilot-db</a>, an open source package for Palm handhelds which allows users to create and exchange databases from their PDA. With the plugin installed you can download files in much the same way that the palm-torrent project from the Open Palm Environment project does. Acting as a plugin for pilot-db gives access to a much more extensive set of editing tools on both the PDA and the desktop. I didn&#8217;t want to write a bookmark management system into palm-torrent, so this seemed like a good option. After all, the plugin was one of the original techniques I proposed when <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/hacking/palm/online-repository.html">I first wrote about the idea</a>. The plugin still needs to be cleaned up a bunch, and there needs to be a bunch of databases with pointers to free info and programs (plucker books, open source apps, etc).  I have the prc sitting in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/">projects area at Bitsplitter</a>, so you can download the plugin using the URL <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/db-download.prc">http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/db-download.prc</a> if you have a copy of palm-torrent on your PDA already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jaron Lanier is <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/03/jaron_lanier_up.html">speaking in Palo Alto</a> on Friday April 23rd. The talk is supposed to be an update to <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge74.html">One Half Of A Manifesto</a>, an article written during 2000 in which he examines the beliefs of what he calls &#8220;cybernetic totalism&#8221;. He argues that the belief that Moore&#8217;s law and artificial intelligence will bring about some new class of humanity is just a form of intellectual laziness no more grounded in reality than any other religious dogma. I particularly enjoyed this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Before you tell me that it will be overwhelmingly obvious when the superintelligent new cyber-species arrives, visit a dog show. Or a gathering of people who believe they have been abducted by aliens in UFOs. People are demonstrably insane when it comes to assessing non-human sentience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certainly sounds like an interesting time, especially so because I can&#8217;t really figure out on which side of this debate I lie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris Pirillo has posted a <a href="http://gnomedex.com/updates/2004-04.php#009917">blogroll of Gnomedex 4 attendees</a>. The list is still pretty short (the conf is still a LONG way off :-) but there are already some interesting blogs on there. I even dropped the <a href="http://rpc.blogrolling.com/rss.php?r=01a2b5cd7c11e1a5f86e415f7258b15c">RSS feed version</a> into my Bloglines subscriptions so I can check out the blogs of new people as they join. An excellent way to find people with like interests before we get out there. There&#8217;s supposed to be an open bar the whole time this year. Making a good impression in advance is necessary so as to preemptively counteract the poor impression that stumbling around spewing technoweenie jargon will make.</p>
