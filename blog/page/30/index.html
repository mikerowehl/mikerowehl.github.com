  <div class="entry-content"><p>The success of Pascal came many years after it was done, due to the availability of microcomputers. Now there were lots of people available to program who didn&#8217;t have to unlearn Fortran. It was driven forward by Borland making the compiler available for only 50 dollars, when other compilers cost thousands. This made a mass market for Pascal.</p>

<p>Many systems at this point could only be built by teams. A way to partition systems was necessary, and led to the the concept of modules, and the development of Modula. Most people still stck with Pascal. Wirth expected everyone in their right mind to switch from Pascal to Modula, but they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Started working on Oberon, which was implemented based on object oriented techniques. But it was never recognized as an object oriented language. It didn&#8217;t cleave to the trends at the time, so it was excluded.</p>

<p>So&#8230; This is supposed to be about how he got interested in languages. Does he consider a career spent on programming languages well spent? He has always considered himself a teacher, but he knows he can&#8217;t teach good design. That takes examples, and is supported by a good language. A complicated syntax and voluminous description is a sign of a poor language. Rules governing the language must be determined apart from the implementation.</p>

<p>Measured on this scale, progress has been made. It was worth the time. Most important now is educating programmers on how to use those tools as best as they can. There is a lot more to do.</p>

<p>The essence of programming languages:</p>

<p>To provide a level of abstraction from details of computers.</p>

<p>To provide a suitable model of computation</p>

<p>To allow mathematical reasoning without recourse to knowledge about the underlying mechanisms</p>

<p>For this we require a concise and precise definition.  Fat manuals are a reliable symptom of failure</p>

<p>Then comes Q and A.</p>

<p>The story of Wirth building a helecopter control system. The trick was to make it disappear. It turned into a cyclic turning process. Taking values from sensors and moving actuators. The whole system is Oberon, only one page of code.</p>

<p>Overloading and templates: Wirth says overloading makes sense and belongs in the basic object oriented toolbox. However he says he has some reservations about the way that most systems implement it, Oberon did it very elegently. Never was able to make good use of templates, but some people might.</p>

<p>Knuth stood up and asked about recursion being missing from the original Pascal spec.  It was true, but it was there by the first implementation.</p>

<p>Question about what languages will people be using in thirty years. Wirth says that most people don&#8217;t program the way that he used to. Now they pick up bits of code from other places. This leads to bloat. In thirty years there will just be more bloat.</p>

<p>Question about functional programming. He says they are interesting, but not really very useful. All so called functional languages have an assignment hidden somewhere. He thinks that people who are fans of functional languages are actually fans of programming without non-local variables.  The fans say thats really very close to the truth.  And Wirth says that he programs like that himself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s some quick notes from the talk that Niklaus Wirth gave at the Computer History Museum on Oct 20th. The topic was &#8220;How I Became Interested In Computer Languages&#8221;.</p>

<p>Professsional career really started in Berkley. Thats when his real experience with computers started. Was always into modeling, and a lot of qualites cary over. Using tools, experimenting, persevering in spite of crashes. Liked physics and chemistry, and didn&#8217;t really pay attention to languages.</p>

<p>When model airplane parts became available, he was forced to study electronics in order to use them. Got theory at University and practice at home. Eary playing with computers took a long time, and ran into people who were working on a translator for computer languages, called a &#8220;compiler&#8221;. Only one person really understood the program, and it was messy, so he decided that the practice of building compilers need structure.</p>

<p>The early version lacked abstraction, it did not abstract away details of the computer hardware. Still it was easier than previous methods.</p>

<p>At the time thing were beautiful in Berkley, golden years. Before Flower Power. He joined in a seminar about Algol. Based on mathematical rigor. There was a clear way to figure out if a text was a valid program. Decided to write a compiler for it. The compiler was short and very simple. Met a witty and engaging person who tossed about some interesting ideas. Made Wirth think about a reduced Algol that had the same expressive power as the original. Wijngaarden.</p>

<p>Became a professor, and people were still trying to figure out what to teach about computers besides languages.  IE. Data structures. The challenge was to introduce rigor into semantics as well as syntax. Although Algol was interesting it didn&#8217;t suit practice very well.</p>

<p>Implemented Algol-W at SLAC. That was a stepping stone to his professional career. He made frequent trips, even overseas, which was not common at the time. There were heated discussions all over about the future of Algol. Algol always remained an academic exercise, never accepted into industry.</p>

<p>Programming became more and more complex, projects became very large, and even large companies drifted dangerously close to collapse. They were not able to deliver on their promises. This is what led to structured programming. Now one person didn&#8217;t have to understand the whole system. This was very far ahead of its time (and maybe still is).</p>

<p>Thing were getting bad with the Vietnam war, and he was offered a job in Zurich to continue work on Algol. He took it. Without having to work with comittee, he was able to work towards what he wanteed. The stuff he wanted stemed from having to teach languages and keeping the compiler clean. The idea was to write the compiler quick in Fortran, and implement the new lanuage, Pascal. Eventually, they had to scrap it. The decision was made to write Pascal in Pascal. The Pascal compiler was translated into another language for which there was a compiler to bootstrap.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two sets of notes from the New Geography workshop put on by the <a href="http://www.iftf.org">Institute For The Future</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Freds House covers <a href="http://www.fredshouse.net/archive/000262.html">the first day</a></p></li>
<li><p>Future Now covers <a href="http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/000578.html">the second day</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to make it unfortunately. From the sounds of it some really interesting topics were discussed. The transformative power of having information available either directly as or tied to maps and geographic location is something I think we&#8217;ve just started to realize. Projects like <a href="http://yellowarrow.org">YellowArrow</a> are a great way to raise the visability, but like many technologies this is one that really requires network effects to get going. Most geographic applications aren&#8217;t all that interesting unless there&#8217;s geographically marked up data to look at. Some commercial sources will output data like that, but of course that&#8217;s because they want to make a dime off the customers. Those could be interesting application, but aren&#8217;t where I expect the main push to be. I think the location based services really take off when you start connecting person to person. Location based services I think will take a bottom up form, much like SMS itself. Most users of SMS aren&#8217;t interested in getting just fresh news or stock quotes delivered to their handsets. Although those are valid applications, the main use for SMS is communicating with friends and colleagues. I think the tipping point for location based services will come when they can fufull the same kind of role. Connecting people to their friends and colleagues. Not to the nearest Pizza Hut.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1461&amp;mo=10&amp;yr=2004">SDForum panel presentation</a> tomorrow about Music and Metadata:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the past 13 years, the web has grown from a simple content distribution mechanism into a vast repository of information and on-line data. As the amount of information available has exploded, and as the number of people using the internet as a source of both information and a way to purchase goods and services has increased exponentially, the use of metadata (or data about the data) has become more important.</p></blockquote>

<p>Early experiments included Epinion&#8217;s reviews and Amazon&#8217;s collaborative filtering. Current experiments include RSS (metadata about which information is new), FOAF (metadata about social relationships), and the semantic web (expressive ways to encode metadata).</p>

<p>In this panel discussion, participants from the bleeding edge of musical metadata will talk about their vision for the future of music, and how metadata will help make that happen.</p>

<p>Fits in with a bunch of stuff I&#8217;m interested in. Why is stuff like this important? Because if we want to transform content from the top-down push that is today into a bottom-up form that looks more like peer-to-peer sharing than corporate content distribution, making systems that allow people to easily find what they&#8217;re looking for are much more important. The current model is that you flip on the radio or walk into a music store to find what you want. The content is pumped out over a number of channels, which exist pretty much just to give you a place to find music when you&#8217;re looking for music. But if the music exists &#8220;somewhere out there&#8221; on the Internet, how can one find what they&#8217;re looking for without reintroducing the controlling distribution channel. In some ways this is an analog of what has been happening with blogging replacing some forms of traditional media. For an example of some of the work going on in the area visit <a href="http://playlist.musicbrainz.org/playlist/moin.cgi/">the XSPF wiki</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brian Cantoni has <a href="http://www.cantoni.org/2004/09/28/sdforum_technorati_talk">a good writeup of a talk about Semantic XHTML</a> given by Kevin Marks and Tantek Celik.  The slides are <a href="http://tantek.com/presentations/20040928sdforumws/semantic-xhtml.html">available online</a> as well. There&#8217;s some good stuff in there. Lately I&#8217;ve been working a bunch with the idea of mixing in additional information with web content. The ideas become much more interesting with <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/2003/01/06/firstEssayOfTheYear">the read-write-web</a> in my opinion. There&#8217;s an elegant layered model for moving user content around evolving. The APIs that started out with blogging, like MetaWeblog and Atom, provide a transport mechanism. Semantic XHTML can provide the structure for those posts to turn a blog post into something more, like an address book update or a calendar event. And those two realms can remain distinct. A standard blog post without semantic information remains a valid post, using Semantic XHTML in some cases doesn&#8217;t preclude using standard HTML in others. For instance the metadata for a <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/MicroContentBlurb">micro-content</a> system could be passed as semantic XHTML in a blog post. Systems used to tend to either require metadata or not allow it at all. New systems, like <a href="http://del.icio.us">the del.icio.us bookmarking system</a>, allow for optional metadata and don&#8217;t enforce any restrictions on how the info is used.</p>

<p>The term for this free-for-all kind of metadata is currently <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/25/folksonomy.php">folksonomy</a>. And like many of the points of interest within the area called social software, it&#8217;s simply a reversal of what &#8220;common knowledge&#8221; computer information management says is an unworkable system. Traditional knowledge said that unstructured metadata for categorization would lead to chaos, you need a strict taxonomy. Del.icio.us has proven that chaos does indeed have it&#8217;s uses, even without a taxonomy the system is still very useful. Traditional knowledge says that any public internet resource needs access control and authentication. Wikis (and the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> in particular) have proven that there are cases where a free-for-all actually increases the rate of production. Even after you factor in time to reverse graffiti and malicious updates. So what are some of the other assumptions that we can attempt to reverse in looking for areas where common knowledge tells us some system is &#8220;unworkable&#8221;?</p>

<p>Well, how about the application interfaces themselves? Traditional system architecture says that in order to build an application you need a set of cooperating APIs, and that accessing remote resources requires something like SOAP/WSDL or CORBA in order to provide a description of the interface and introspection and versioning. But there&#8217;s been a lot of resistence to this view of the network, such as the RESTian response to web services. Most recently the <a href="http://www.jot.com/">JotSpot</a> tool seems to have embraced the idea also. Applications aren&#8217;t bits of binary code linking together local libraries into a strict framework of classes and objects, they&#8217;re transformations and pointers linking togther and unifiying resources out on the web. It&#8217;s a completely different take on the control vs. flexibility tradeoff than is normally taken. Don&#8217;t errect a strict barrier arround your application to isolate it from the world. Provide every affordance and convenience to allow data in any form to contribute. I personally expect a lot more work in this direction over the next couple of months. It just logically lays in line with a series of movements that have been taking shape and gaining momentum for at least a year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> was fantastic. Lots of people to talk to, and I thought the panel discussions were interesting even if others found some fault with them. Being at the conf you hear about a bunch of stuff that it&#8217;s hard to find your way to if you weren&#8217;t there to hear the off the cuff comments or pick up the links from IRC (I really should have logged the channel&#8230; oops). So here&#8217;s a bunch of stuff, some from the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=338">previous page I had</a> and some new stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Eric Rice did <a href="http://eric.blognews.com/blog/_archives/2004/10/2/153034.html">a podcast</a> from the conf. He&#8217;s really into the podcast idea. Seems to fit in as a logical extension of the <a href="http://www.audioblog.com/">Audioblog</a> stuff he&#8217;s doing already. He says a regular show is probably in the works, so keep an eye out for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Taylor has <a href="http://www.free-web-money.com/cat_pay_per_click_ppc_advertising.html">a page to go along with The Future of Online Advertising panel</a>. It&#8217;s not an exhaustive list, but enough to get your fingers into the concepts. Great resource.</p></li>
<li><p>There were a whole bunch of people taking pictures:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterkaminski/sets/16646/">Peter Kaminski</a> - who was also very cool, I got to speak to Peter for a while.  He works for SocialText and I have a lot of interest in the collaborative application space.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ponzarelli.com/blog/Photos">Ponzi</a> - I didn&#8217;t get to speak to her, but have second hand information from <a href="http://kalsey.com/">Adam</a> that both her and Chris really went out of their way to help him when he wasn&#8217;t feeling well. Now that just kicks ass.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://kenlayne.com/2004/10/foto-fun.html">Ken Layne</a> - provides some commentary on photos that were actually taken by <a href="http://marc.buzznet.com/user/">Marc Brown</a>. I didn&#8217;t talk to Ken, but did get to speak to Marc. Marc is going to be in San Francisco for <a href="http://www.ctia.org/">CTIA</a>, so we&#8217;re probably going to get together for a Bird of a Feather meeting. Check out <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org">Bay Area Mobility Forum</a> for more info about that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pjmorr">Phil Morrison</a> - has some great pics up now. We spoke in the IRC channel, but never synced up in the real world. Yet still I feel like we met&#8230; There&#8217;s probably a lesson in there somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.noded.com/noded/">JR Noded</a> - has a few higher quality pictures up. He was sitting at our table for a bit, very nice guy</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There were a bunch of people who were raving about <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Blogware</a>, Eric Rice in particular. I got a chance to speak to Ross Rader about it as well, he provided a nice high level overview. The summary that I pulled out of the discussion is that it&#8217;s a tool based more on sharing than on publishing. If that&#8217;s correct, I think it should be very interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the attendees set up <a href="http://www.arete.cc/godmug/">a Mac Users Group</a> for the conf. There were a hell of a lot of glowing Apple logos all over the place. Personally, I&#8217;m really jealous of the battery life the things get. I&#8217;ve got my eye turned that way when it&#8217;s time for the next system.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had some great conversations over at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex </a> so far.  Here is a by-no-means complete set of links to people I didn&#8217;t know before, but I had interesting conversations with.  Now I&#8217;m going to be reading their stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kalsey.com/blog/">Adam Kalsey</a> - was just a really cool guy in all respects</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.blogads.com/">Henry Copeland</a> - made some great comments during the Digital Lifestyles panel, and we had a good talk about some of the general issues around high tech and its frequent disconnect from reality</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.ziffdavis.com/louderback/">Jim Louderback</a> - great comments about mobile devices being the important platform to look to when talking about the future of &#8220;the digital lifestyle&#8221;.

<li><p><a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Ross Rader</a> - I spoke to Ross a bunch of times too. He had plenty of good points during conversations along the lines of &#8220;well that sounds like a great idea, but ..&#8221; and then normally three or four reasons why what I&#8217;m talking about is practically infeasible. I haven&#8217;t tried out Blogware yet, but now I&#8217;m very tempted to.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> to follow the <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> comments, but that info seems to be pretty lagged. And Gnomedex has a <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/contact/submissions.phtml">submit info page</a> but they some some stuff about making decisions to publish stuff. So I&#8217;m assuming that isn&#8217;t realtime either. So here&#8217;s a post to either leave pointers to your resources, or submit trackbacks.  We have an IRC channel going on <a href="http://www.freenode.net">Freenode</a>, channel #gnomedex. Here&#8217;s some of the stuff people in IRC have posted:</p>
