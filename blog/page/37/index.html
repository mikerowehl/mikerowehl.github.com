  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried to use the TMobile interface for using AOL Instant Messenger from my mobile phone the other day, and it didn&#8217;t quite work out the way that I had hoped. In the past I probably would have gone off on a rant about it. But now that I have an unlimited data account, and because the AIM interface is a free feature, I&#8217;m not going to do that. Instead I&#8217;m going to say that it&#8217;s pretty cool of TMobile to try to integrate their online services with existing offerings. They just have some work to do before the service is generally applicable. There are a few quirks and limitations that make the service hard to use and impractical if the people you&#8217;re talking to don&#8217;t know to modify their behavior to account for the interface you&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>The first issue is the most grievous offense actually. Once you sign on to the service it notifies you of new messages via WAP push. This is actually pretty crappy of them, because push messages are NOT a limitless resource, at least I don&#8217;t think so. I won&#8217;t rant about that right now, cause first I want to validate this suspicion about the cost. However, even without the cost factor, this was really annoying and a hindrance to using the service. There was no way to turn off these messages that I was able to find. And each time a new message came it interferes with whatever you&#8217;re doing. You have to acknowledge the message in an asynchronous pop-up screen. This really sucked when the person I was talking to wrote a bunch of really short messages like:</p>

<p>Hey, you there?
I have a meeting soon.
I have to go now.
See you soon.</p>

<p>Which generated 4 separate messages that came in right on top of each other, and were disruptive enough that I couldn&#8217;t get a response in at all before it was too late. Why the WAP pushes? <a href="http://winksite.com/">WINKsite</a> does its group chat using an automatically refreshed page. That&#8217;s really worked out well on just about every device I&#8217;ve tried it from.</p>

<p>The conversations page also seems to only display new messages when you load it. That means that if you&#8217;re reading messages from a conversation, and you accept a WAP push of a new message, the page you end up at no longer holds the text you were just reading. That sucks IMO. If you want to draw attention to newest messages then reverse the order in which the messages are displayed (newest messages at the top) and maybe put a marker next to the new lines. Displaying only the new messages takes all of the context out of what should be a nice flow of conversation. That gets confusing enough when you have a single conversation that keeps you bouncing back and forth between WAP push notification screens and the browser. It&#8217;s almost impossible if you have multiple conversations going on.</p>

<p>The last one might have been user error, but it was user error caused by multiple issues with the features as implemented. It seems like the scrollback buffer is only a few lines long. When I logged in at one point I started a conversation with my girlfriend. I said hello, and that I was on the train on my way back from a meeting. This triggered a torrent of messages. Not at all out of the realm of normal use. The reason for using IM is to keep in touch, right? And she had some news. So she wrote a message and I got the push, which I accepted. While I&#8217;m waiting for the browser to load, I get another message. Bing, bing bing bing. This goes on for maybe a half dozen messages, I lost count. Finally I have a browser sitting in front of me with what are obviously messages from the middle of a long story she&#8217;s telling. I don&#8217;t have the start of the story, and the WAP messages are binging in so quickly that I can&#8217;t get a message back to her to say that I missed the start of her story. That really sucked.</p>

<p>So, the obvious programmer answer to this is to just not talk to people who send torrents of messages like that. But I would really like to see mobile services reach mass appeal. And while TMobile has made a good effort in terms of providing a service to make the mobile experience more continuous with the online experience, it doesn&#8217;t quite make it to the level it needs for general usage. It just isn&#8217;t realistic to expect every user to work out some way to let the people that they talk to know that they&#8217;re on a mobile phone when they login. And if the service really is supposed to unify desktop and mobile messaging it needs to enable the same operations or provide some mechanism for dealing with the differences easily (hopefully automatically). Some of the issues seem to just require minor tweaks. Keep old messages on the conversation screen, reverse the display order so that the newest messages are at the top, and provide a config option to disable WAP push and make the conversations page automatically update.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the persistent features of the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=278">user programmable systems</a> I was blabbing about yesterday is visual programming. The idea here is that users have pictograms that they can move around on the screen and connect to each other. Each symbol on the screen represents one of the software components in the system and/or some transformation to apply. This is the second time in the last few months that visual programming has come to mind. Last time was when I was fooling around with Scheme and realized that there seems to be a much more natural mapping for functional languages to move to visual composition. Visual programming is another of those areas that seems really simple when we talk about it, but must have some really thorny problems that have yet to get sorted. It&#8217;s an area that I don&#8217;t have very much experience with in general.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s come up a few times recently, and I have another project going on that involves graphing and diagramming functionality in general (not fronting for executable logic), so I figured I would dig around a little bit. The <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/vpl.html">Visual Language Research Bibliography</a> seems to be a great way to do that. I was interested to see that there was some <a href="http://www.iks.inf.ethz.ch/publications/bio03v.html">work related directly to visual composition of web services</a>. Not that it really changes anything today, but it is an interesting thought experiment along the lines of &#8220;how do I access the functions I want from my handset&#8221;. Not that I would expect users to be able to (or want to!!) draw little pictures on their phone in order to interact with data and communicate with friends. But it does seem like a solution to one would complement the other. Coming up with a way to segment services such that they could be presented on a pure visual interface while retaining enough expressive power to solve complex problems seems like it would get you a long way toward coming up with an interface to operations that would be usable from a mobile device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been taking some time to try to step back a bit and consider the role of technology as a whole. Already a pretty popular topic, many of the currently popular bloggers mix politics, sociology, psychology, and technology into their own editorials. But I&#8217;m not taking quite that big of a step back. I&#8217;m thinking more in terms of the overall productivity that technology brings. I find it very easy to fall into the trap of striving for a technical hack for no reason. When I see a problem sometimes I just want to solve it. Probably a pretty healthy overall attitude, but like anything too much is bad thing. So I have a bunch of toys now: a good hosting plan for my main site so I can run what I want, a PDA with bluetooth and 802.11 interfaces, a new cell phone, a GPRS plan with no data limit. So it was time to take a deep breath and think about what that means instead of just running off in search of the next gadget.</p>

<p>I use my phone for the standard SMS usages, mostly coordination of meetings with people and notifications. I use it for work a decent amount, just to let someone know what the status is if IM isn&#8217;t an option. I also use it for small reminders to myself however. Over the last few months I&#8217;ve really started to &#8220;live out of my inbox&#8221;, which is one of the phrases used to describe the common condition of organizing work based on the email in your inbox. I could just take a note on my phone, or put a todo item in my PDA, but I&#8217;ve found it much more convenient to be able to insert that message right into the place where I know I&#8217;ll be able to manage it. The service I have provides a special number that I can send an SMS to, but which then delivers the message to an email address. Very convenient for when a quick idea strikes. Something I would like to do, but haven&#8217;t done yet, is setting up filters on my mail server to SMS me a message when someone from my address book sends me an email. This is something that the Blackberry devices do well. They deliver a message to the device asynchronously whenever there&#8217;s a new email. The mix I have doesn&#8217;t support that directly, but it&#8217;s something I can hack together.</p>

<p>My address book is becoming more and more important as well. For me, the &#8220;official&#8221; version is the one on my PDA. I would like to be able to sync that information around easily.. but even after all these years bluetooth doesn&#8217;t deliver in this regard. If I send my address book from my Clie to my T610 some fields end up in the wrong places, and there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a sync (just a send). So I&#8217;ll have to spend some time trying out a tool like <a href="http://multisync.sourceforge.net/">MultiSync</a> to see if I can get a sync between the devices working. I won&#8217;t bother complaining about the need to involve a third device in that transaction.</p>

<p>These are all little bits of detail however. What I would really like to be able to do is take an overall look at my practice of information management. I&#8217;ve described some pieces of what I would like to be a much more unified technique for moving my information around. One of the major issues standing in the way of a fluid set of interactions with my information is the lack of ad-hoc reconfiguration that software provides. We&#8217;ve been hearing for a long time that the world of user programmable systems is just around the corner. The ultimate vision is that computer software systems will consist of easily pluggable components which even the most casual user can assemble into the software that they want. No one has been able to deliver on that architecture however. One of the latest incarnations of the vision seems to be within enterprise computing, where a technology called web services and an associated paradigm called service oriented architecture are currently all the rage. However, I&#8217;m interested in the problem all the way at the other end of the scale of computing. How can services be provided in a generic way such that online and offline information can be blended, and that I can access the information that I want and perform the actions that I need to both from my PC and from my phone or PDA? It&#8217;s a tough question.</p>

<p>Some of the examples that I find the most appealing come from pretty much the same arena, they&#8217;re chat based services. The first are IRC bots. These are programs that connect to the IRC network and listen for commands sent to them using the same mechanisms that an IRC user would use to communicate with any other IRC user. The second are applications built on top of instant messaging frameworks, in particular <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>. In both cases a user can interact with the program in the same way that they communicate with friends and colleagues. But that can&#8217;t be the only difference. If that were the only important characteristic then systems like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">Mailman</a> would fall into the same bucket. I think it&#8217;s probably important that the chat based programs act very much like bridges into other systems. Many bots have functions such as performing lookups on websites, tracking when users last logged in and storing some profile information about them, keeping common definitions and references, and notifications about external events (one example of this would be <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pastebot/">pastebot</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, they&#8217;re really just hacks to allow this external information to be accessed using chat as the medium. What should the medium of access be in the ideal system? How should the subsystems interface? What should the user see while assembling their components?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I agree with the <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007851.html">response that Russell Beattie</a> has to a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5092826/site/newsweek/">recent article in Newsweek</a>. Although there are some points that I disagree about. I do agree that asking Palm about the future of mobile devices is awfully one sided. Although from what I&#8217;ve read, Jeff Hawkins is a stunningly smart guy with a great grip on technology, I do think the wireless mobile vision of PalmOne is seriously suspect. Jeff might be able to help out there, but their track record is far from stunning when it comes to network devices. I do agree with Russ that Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, etc. are probably better places to look. However, I think this is one of those often sprung technologist pitfalls. Having the better technology, and being of more use to the user, isn&#8217;t a sure recipe for success. Yes, Palm does have a proprietary operating system, and just about any platform technology besides PalmOS looks like a good alternative to the developer. However, what does the standard user see? I&#8217;m not sure that the better technology of Motorola and Nokia within the mobile space is going to be enough to overcome the brand recognition and existing sales channels that Palm has. I would LIKE it to, I&#8217;m just not sure it&#8217;s going to happen. When it comes to the average user, they need to be sold on the package as it exists when it comes to them. They don&#8217;t and probably never will care about the platform. Even though the choice will seriously impact them somewhere down the line.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Microsoft empire. Many users are unhappy about the current state of the market, but at the end they have no one to blame but themselves. The users put Microsoft in a certain position within their technology profile, and now they have to deal with it. I think that it&#8217;s entirely possible for the same kind of thing to happen in this market. Non-proprietary platforms and extensibility don&#8217;t mean crap if someone else can get a good enough product in front of the user in a functional form at the right time. So although Russ says that it&#8217;s a badly written and badly researched article, I would kindly disagree. I think it&#8217;s a wakeup call of the other smartphone manufacturers to get off their asses and start building some brand recognition with the user audience. They&#8217;ve done a good job with the developers, but you can&#8217;t count on the techies to carry your message out to the people. You have to bring it there on your own. Don&#8217;t count on the cellular service providers to sell your handsets by selling users on data service. Providers can&#8217;t do it, especially not here in the US. The cellular service providers just don&#8217;t get mobile applications, as astounding as that may seem. If you have a mobile data device you are going to have to sell the users on it yourself.</p>

<time datetime="2004-05-28T20:19:47-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 28<span>th</span>, 2004</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3202">thread from the Linux Kernel Mailing List</a> which seems to have gotten picked up all over the place. Most sources seem to be including the quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nick Piggin explained that swap can improve performance no matter how much RAM you have, &#8220;well it is a magical property of swap space, because extra RAM doesn&#8217;t allow you to replace unused memory with often used memory. The theory holds true no matter how much RAM you have. Swap can improve performance. It can be trivially demonstrated.&#8221; This said, numerous Linux users do report success running a swapless system.</p></blockquote>

<p>But not very many have done anything to shed any light on what&#8217;s meant there.I&#8217;ll try to give a brief example which hopefully will explain. What&#8217;s meant by &#8220;replace unused memory with often used memory&#8221; is that the VM subsystem should be able to replace a necessary but infrequently accessed page with a page that gets used very frequently. As an example lets say that you have 256 meg of memory in your desktop system. 128 meg is being used by a GNU Chess game you were in the middle of, but paused because you were struck by a sudden urge to rework a program that processes XML files and turns them into images. Lets say that the XML files in your test set comprise 192 meg of data. They don&#8217;t have to all be in memory at the same time, but the full set of file data comprises 192 meg worth of space.</p>

<p>Now, to understand the behavior differences between the with-swap and without-swap cases it&#8217;s necessary to understand the concept of caching that operating systems like Linux practice. Caching in this case takes the form of the operating system leaving information from the disk sitting in RAM as long as there&#8217;s free memory. This keeps the operating system from having to go back to the slow disk to get a file if you end up reusing the file. In an ideal world the RAM in a system would be large enough so that it never gets filled up, but this isn&#8217;t the case. So the operating system tries to keep as much information from the disk sitting in RAM as it can. This way if I grep a file for &#8220;mike&#8221; and then with the next command grep the file for &#8220;rocks&#8221;, the operating system doesn&#8217;t have to read the file from disk twice. Assuming it has some free RAM to use, after my first command it will keep the file contents sitting in memory. Then when I type my second command it sees the copy in memory already and skips the disk operations.</p>

<p>First lets assume that you have no swap at all in your system. You can still do this work, no problem. As long as all 192 meg of your data files don&#8217;t have to be in memory at the same time, which we&#8217;re assuming they wouldn&#8217;t have to be. It would be somewhat slow however, because after processing 128 meg of your input files the system would have run out of memory. It would have to start dropping the first files from the set in order to read in the contents of the last 64 meg of contents. So end the end of processing, the cache contains the final 128 meg of your data files, the first 64 meg have now been dropped from the cache. But now you fix a few bugs in your program and run your tests again.  The first 64 meg of data needs to be read in again, producing more disk operations. Lets say you cycle over and over again running your program on this full set of data. With every run the disk is going to have to get accessed because not all of your files will fit into RAM with your suspended GNU Chess program sitting there. This is what people mean when they say that &#8220;the full working set&#8221; doesn&#8217;t fit in memory. It means that you can run your program, but that the system has to use the disk when it wouldn&#8217;t have had to if you had more memory.</p>

<p>Now, lets say that you have your system setup with 128 meg worth of swap space in addition to the 256 meg of RAM you have. Once again, assuming this is an ideal situation, when you run out of RAM the virtual memory subsystem looks at the currently used memory and says &#8220;hey, this GNU Chess program isn&#8217;t being used&#8221;. So instead of dropping your first 64 meg of data files out of cache, it instead uses the swap space to move 64 meg of the suspended GNU Chess program off to disk. Now all 192 meg of your data files are in RAM. You run your program over and over again now, and no disk operations need to be performed. Eventually, when you start using GNU Chess again, those 64 meg moved off to swap need to be reloaded. But if we assume that you&#8217;ve run your tests multiple times, the net result is a savings. This is what was meant by replacing unused memory with frequently used memory. Swap gives the virtual memory subsystem somewhere to put pages that it thinks won&#8217;t be used for a long time, and instead use that space to speed up the operations that are actually currently going on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of times I groan at the statements that come out of the MIT Media Lab, but TheFeature has <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100678">an interview with William Mitchell, director of the MIT Media Lab</a> and I really liked what he had to say at the end of the interview.</p>

<blockquote><p>We must understand the relationship between these rather abstract technologies and our everyday lives. We need to ask ourselves how we want to live our lives and how we can organize our technological capabilities to fulfill those ideals. Public debate is critical. And you can only have that debate if you engage the public&#8217;s imagination.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rock on, I think that&#8217;s a great attitude for potential innovators to have. Lots of times us technologists run off and start working with new technologies and forget that they eventually have to be used by people who might have no idea what we&#8217;re talking about. Especially in places where many of the people you interact with every day are at least somewhat technically adept (such as here in Silicon Valley or in the labs at MIT) it can be easy to lose perspective.</p>

<p>Realizing that the pitfall exists is only part of the problem however.  As William says, you need to engage the public in a dialog about what needs they would like served, and in order to do that you need their attention and you have to capture their imagination. Well, for most people they aren&#8217;t very interested in a new technology unless it&#8217;s something they can use already. They don&#8217;t really want to play with demos or prototypes, they&#8217;re concerned with what they can do to solve their problems. So you have a kind of chicken and the egg problem of users needing to drive the development process but not being really interested until a product is ready. One of the traditional solutions to this issue is focusing on a group called the &#8220;early adopters&#8221;. These are the people who are willing to put some time into finding the correct solution for their problems. They&#8217;re a little more experimental and are normally highly motivated to establish a new solution to their pain points. What a tech company will do is try to service that early group as best as they can, and try to use those people as a proving ground and to collect input. The hope is that the early adopters can provide some insight into what needs to be done to service the main body of users who will hopefully be following some time later. &#8220;Some time&#8221; equals however long it takes for the product to reach a stage where the user no longer has to put up with quirks and shortcomings in the system, they just get their packaged solution at a price which they think is justified by the value they&#8217;ve been provided.</p>

<p>The issue that I have pretty much constantly with &#8220;mobile services&#8221; is that they make it difficult to run these early stage experiments. Many of the wireless network specific features (SMS, EMS, MMS, WAP push, geolocation information, etc) aren&#8217;t presented in a way that makes it easy for a third party application provider to use. Say for instance I&#8217;m working on something in the style of the <a href="http://architecture.mit.edu/house_n/">Home of the Future</a> referenced in that article. Say I&#8217;m making an Internet appliance that I want to sell to people that they can hook up to their broadband connection in their house. This isn&#8217;t a big deal, broadband is apparently really gaining in popularity both here in the US and abroad. It used to be that providing a service which required your standard home user to get a DSL or cable modem could be a pain. But this is no longer the barrier that it used to be. I want the device to provide a web interface, and I want it to be hooked up to cameras, control equipment, and sensors. Also, not a big deal here. There are lots of people <a href="http://www.axis.com/">with IP cameras</a> or <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=4,CONTENTID=5041">simple webcams</a>. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smarthome.com/">a hell of a lot of control and security hardware</a> meant to be hooked together and fed into computer control systems. This also isn&#8217;t hard to get working.</p>

<p>But now say I want that system to be able to interact with the owners wireless device. And I don&#8217;t just mean providing a WAP page they can use to check on their system, that&#8217;s really just the most basic level. What if I want to send those images from the camera as MMS if the user has gone away on vacation and someone opens the front door? Well, now we have some issues. All of a sudden our well connected world and it&#8217;s seamless information architecture suddenly seems very discontinuous. How do we get a message from the Internet to a mobile device? Well, the answer is normally that it&#8217;s just not that simple. Unless you want to involve the cell phone service providers whom your customers for this Internet appliance might be using, you&#8217;re pretty much stuck. So that means going to everyone (ATT, Cingular, TMobile, Sprint, Verizon, Boost, Orange, TIM, Vodaphone, Wind, and on and on) and making some deal with them so that you can provide your Internet appliance to talk to a mobile appliance. Or you could restrict yourself to just a few of those providers, and selling your appliance through channels that select only users of that service. And of course, in order to talk to people like Cingular and Sprint without getting laughed out of their offices you need to have a very solid revenue stream in place you hope to share with them. They normally aren&#8217;t interested in your great idea unless it&#8217;ll make them money right away. Not a great environment for innovation.</p>

<p>So I agree that we need to engage potential users in a discussion about how to best service their needs. But I&#8217;m very sketchy on how we provide the prototype systems and trial deployments necessary to foster that discussion without bypassing the existing wide area wireless infrastructure. One option is to just ignore the enhanced services of the wireless networks, and just use the data capabilities to build what amount to standard Internet applications. But there are lots of issues with a model like this, many of them too technical to get into here I think. What we need is the ability to experiment with new services before they&#8217;re finalized, otherwise the applications that get forced into the wireless pipe are going to be immature and probably poorly positioned in terms of value. I think we&#8217;re already seeing this happen to a degree. MMS hasn&#8217;t seen the uptake that most were expecting it to. I place the blame squarely on the MMS infrastructure being more restrictive than that of SMS. It&#8217;s hard to know who you will and will not be able to send MMS to, and exchange agreements between service providers are ill defined if they exist at all. Normal users aren&#8217;t going to bother taking the time to learn a new service if they aren&#8217;t going to be able to use it in all the time. Technical restrictions like service provider peering agreements are indistinguishable plain old failure if the end result for the user is inability to complete their task. Even worse because the failures tend to be silent.</p>

<p>How do we come up with a system that allows this experimentation? I have no idea. But I&#8217;m fairly certain that someone needs to work out how to apply better <a href="http://www.reed.com/Papers/EndtoEnd.html">end-to-end design</a> with relation to hooking Internet services up to mobile services. There are issues.. I know there are issues with trying to do this. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not the right thing to do. With all the talk about the dissolving barriers of communication, and electronic information flows, I&#8217;m surprised to see what seems to be an increasing gulf between Internet and mobile services. The flow of bits from my home network to my cell phone and vice versa appears to be anything but seamless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading about <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/05/26/communities_tied_to_one_technology.php">communities tied to one technology</a> in Many2Many I spent a bit of time wandering around in the <a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/">CommunityWiki</a> in general. I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=250">ran across some stuff by Lion Kimbro a little while ago</a>, and I see his name and what seems to be the mark of his ideas throughout the wiki. That&#8217;s a good thing, I liked what I had read. And the community wiki seems to be very enlightening. I would like to make a few comments about wikis in general before I get back to reading through that stuff. There&#8217;s been a lot of interest in wikis lately, and I&#8217;m not sure how much information there has been that simply lays down why wikis have been garnering attention. If you&#8217;re a wiki guru, I know you could probably take issue with some of the definitions I end up giving here. I want to lay down in broad strokes what this wiki thing is all about however.</p>

<p>In the most general form, a wiki is a site where anyone can edit the pages. Take the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/community/SiteMap">SiteMap of the CommunityWiki</a> for example. In the footer of the page there&#8217;s a link that says &#8220;Edit text of this page&#8221;. If you click on it you can change the content of the page and save it. Everyone else coming to that page will then see your changes by default. It would seem that this would lead to utter chaos, but it doesn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s been <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyWikiWorks">lots of discussion about why this community editing works</a>, but suffice it to say that in most cases it does. What I&#8217;m more interested is why there&#8217;s been a lot of interest in wikis recently. There are a couple of mentions in the community wiki about a wiki being a <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?DocumentMode">document based</a> instead of a message based medium. I think that makes a huge impact on their perceived usage. What&#8217;s meant there is that a wiki is an excellent tool for allowing a group of people to collaborate on a shared set of work. There aren&#8217;t very many mainstream technologies which do that today. The most major methods of online communication are email, IM, and now blogs. But none of those provide a good way to work toward a common goal. They are great ways of fostering discussion, which in some cases is all you want. You can email documents back and forth as you work on them, but this really only works when you have a master for the group who merges everything back together and holds the authoritative copy. Programmers realized long ago that in order to work together they needed tools with which to manage their work, so revision control systems (like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/cvs.html">CVS</a> were born). The essential role of the version control system is keeping track of who made what changes, when they were made, and providing access to all those historical bits of info. Version control systems sit at the core of almost all software projects, they&#8217;re now considered to be absolutely essential. I think of a wiki as fulfilling much the same role, but for people who don&#8217;t happen to be working on code, for people who are working on human readable documents.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t just something that I made up, it&#8217;s part of the technical implementation of the wiki. Underneath most wiki software packages is normally some kind of revision control package, some packages actually call through to developer tools to store their revisions. I think working out from this basic isomorphism (a wiki and a code revision control system) can provide a lot of the insight into why it&#8217;s an interesting tool. I come from the developer end of things, and it&#8217;s quite common to hear developers crapping all over some popular technique because of it&#8217;s simplicity. I can&#8217;t count the number of times I used to hear developers say things like &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal with blogging? It&#8217;s just an easy to update web page.&#8221; They do the same thing with wikis, they&#8217;ll normally say something like &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal? So anyone can go and change a page.&#8221; The proper response is to say, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s a revision control system built into a website.&#8221; Normally if you tell them something like that, and they can relate it to what they use, you can actually get some useful input out of them rather than just criticism. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m gonna say for now, I wanna read more CommunityWiki stuff.. maybe I&#8217;ll have time to add some more comments later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve registered myself for <a href="http://www.artofthestart.com/">The Art of the Start</a>, a day long event by <a href="http://www.garage.com/">Garage Technology Ventures</a> focused on educating entrepreneurs about successfully starting a company. A friend pointed out that if you&#8217;re an <a href="http://www.sdforum.org">SDForum</a> member you can get fifty dollars off on the registration. You just need to call up SDForum and get the promotion code to use, they have info on the <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/Level1.aspx?pid=10080&amp;sid=7">Special Offers</a> page. If you&#8217;re planning to be over there, drop me a line and we&#8217;ll meet up. I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be somewhat out of my element, but that&#8217;s fine.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going after all. I would eventually like to start up an entrepreneurial venture of my own and I know there&#8217;s a lot I still don&#8217;t know. Even though I&#8217;ve technically only been consulting on my own for a few months, I&#8217;ve met some very interesting people and run across some great ideas. It takes a whole lot more than just a good idea to start up a successful company however. Some people seem to be able to do it without thinking, others have to work at it to be able to see all the angles. I know I&#8217;m in the latter category. I&#8217;m just trying to front load as much of the work as I can, so that I&#8217;m not learning everything on the job later on.</p>

I&#8217;ve been using it quite a bit again, cause it&#8217;s a convenient way to keep track of stuff I want to read without bookmarking it at whatever computer I happen to be at (probably not the same computer that I&#8217;ll be at later when I want to retrieve that bookmark). My link blog has the extra attribute of concentrating on links which render well on small screens - the stuff I chuck there is meant to be pulled up on my Palm for later reading. It&#8217;s actually a pretty decent set of reading in small-screen-friendly format.</p>
