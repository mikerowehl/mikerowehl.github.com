  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t have time to post about it when I put it up, but I want to talk about the last Feed of the Day I put up: <a href="http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/index.php">The Year of Coffee</a>. I ran across it cause I have a subscription to a <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=feedster&amp;sort=date">vanity feed for Feedster</a> so that I can see when anyone is talking about us. Fantastic idea, I recommend it for anyone, it&#8217;s amazing the stuff you&#8217;ll find. At first when I looked at it I thought &#8220;hey, is this a stealth blog for <a href="http://www.peets.com">Peet&#8217;s</a>?&#8221; (notice that when I think to myself I insert hyperlinks, sometimes that makes my head hurt). If that&#8217;s a marketing piece it&#8217;s a fantastic effort! The basic premise is that Lloyd, the person running the site, is taking a picture of each cup of coffee for a year and posting it online. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/archives/2005/01/01/happy-new-year/category">post that kicked it off</a>. But it&#8217;s not just coffee cups that go up there, it&#8217;s commentary and bits of stories. The consistent serial nature of the updates, along with the nuggets of larger stories placed next to quick notes, really make the blog feel more like a continuous flow than a series of disconnected updates. It&#8217;s weird, it&#8217;s interesting, it&#8217;s a slice of life, and it&#8217;s made me laugh more than once. Thanks Lloyd!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some notes from the <a href="http://softtechvc.blogs.com/software_only/2005/02/from_an_idea_to.html">talk Jeff Clavier gave at BMA</a> this morning. A lot of the talk was about the enterprise side of the equation. &#8220;What does it take to get an enterprise software play to market&#8221; type of questions. But the discussion started out with a preface not to take generalizations too seriously. People will say &#8220;VCs don&#8217;t really do that&#8221; or &#8220;you&#8217;re never going to see that from a VC&#8221;, but that needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Normally these statements are overgeneralized. Different VCs act differently, and behavior that you would never see from one group may not be that uncommon from another. So pay attention and make sure to contextualize the information you get.</p>

<p>First off, it&#8217;s hard to create an enterprise startup. Something like 10,000 enterprise software companies were funded during the bubble, and of those about 5 or 6 thousand remain. That&#8217;s a lot of competition. Even if you pick a niche to fill, it can still be very difficult. There are 20 or 30 storage companies for example, entry into that area is very costly and risky. VCs in general recognize that there was an over investment in enterprise plays. It&#8217;s not that they won&#8217;t back a play like this, it just tends to be the very big deal and it has to be something differentiated.</p>

<p>There are four main factors that commonly go into evaluating an opportunity: whitespace, direct experience, disruption, and the team:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first is the idea itself. How good is the idea?  How differentiated is it? Jeff said this is called &#8220;whitespace&#8221; sometimes, the blank area between the idea you have and the adjacent ideas. Map out the whitespace and make sure the area is big enough. Is it referencable whitespace? Can you explain to investors why your idea is different?</p></li>
<li><p>Direct experience in putting the solution together, like the &#8220;scratch your own itch&#8221; maxim from open source, is a good litmus test for the general validity of the product. If you made your product because you needed it yourself, there&#8217;s a good chance others out there might need it also.</p></li>
<li><p>Disruption means cost savings in some way. It may be a sea change in technology that drives cost reduction, or new methods, or a new business model. But it needs to be something big. The savings needs to be significant enough to outweigh the risk of switching to the new system.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes teams of people just work right. People will toss money at them just to see what happens. If your team has a proven track record it can go a long way toward helping out with the current effort. Jeff said something like if you have the right people you can paint anything on &#8220;the canvas of the team&#8221;, I liked that turn of phrase. Sifry mentioned <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=419">paying attention to the corporate DNA that you&#8217;re building</a> last week. This is always important, funding or no funding. There&#8217;s just no substitute for having good people willing to work together.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Based on your idea you have to define how you sell and what your ecosystem looks like. Ecosystem means your customers, competitors, partners, and people who might be either competitors or partners. How high of a hurdle is there for market entry? Who can you potentially target as a partner? Sizing of the market is one of the most difficult things to do. Pick meaningful numbers. The size of the market overall means nothing, the addressable portion of the market is what you need to know. Everyone likes to say they will have 20 or 40 percent of the market, and that simply never happens. You&#8217;re lucky if it&#8217;s 1 or 2 percent. Look at behavior within the ecosystem. What are the purchase habits, what is the lead time, budgets, deployment time? What are the trends? Lots of funding in an area is a predictor of price pressure, it&#8217;s actually not a good thing. Get out there and talk to people. Network with others in your market. Find people who have started successful businesses in the same area. Research online as well. There are sure to be blogs that give info about the area.</p>

<p>Sharing your sale with a consulting company is not &#8220;leaving value on the table&#8221;, it&#8217;s part of building your ecosystem. Of course you have to find the right consulting company, someone who won&#8217;t take the money and run. Eventually that consultancy can be a valuable partner, helping to bring you business.</p>

<p>Frequently there is a point at which you have to choose continued growth or profitability. If you need to reinvest enough of your profits to keep growing, and you need money to do so, that&#8217;s a good time to think about funding. You need the right mix of growth, partnerships, differentiation, and guts to keep growing though. That&#8217;s true if you need funding or not. If you want sustainability you need diversity. Diversified revenue and multiple product lines. It&#8217;s hard to get real big with a singular focus. How do you measure diversity against a loss of focus? Make sure you have a repeatable sales process for what you have and that the product is up and established before looking at adjacent opportunities.</p>

<p>What can you do as entrepreneurs? Find people who want to join for no pay. Find people with the same passion and the same willingness to take a risk. Network. Try to find like-minded people and they&#8217;ll show you to the pockets of cash needed to keep your business up and going. Find VCs speaking at events. The VCs are out there normally cause they&#8217;re looking to tap into deals, they&#8217;re receptive then. Give them your elevator pitch and gage their interest. Don&#8217;t bother cold calling on VCs, it&#8217;s not worth the time. If the VC seems interested, cozy up to their assistant. The VCs assistant is your best connection, they have great info for you (where the VC is, how you can contact them, when they&#8217;ll be back, etc). Mine your own network. Find people with connections to VCs, strong connections, connections that get phone calls returned. Sometimes you can do premarket meetings with VCs. If you&#8217;re not ready for funding you can present what you are working on, just to get their feedback and educate them somewhat. Then when you&#8217;re ready for funding they&#8217;re already familiar with you and what your position is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Greg Gershman from Blogdigger is <a href="http://www.blogdigger.com/blog/2005/02/14/1108421226000.html">in town for a little bit</a> and wanted to do a get together.  The plan is to meet up at Jing Jing downtown Palo Alto at 6:30pm on Wed Feb 16th. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&amp;country=US&amp;addtohistory=&amp;searchtab=home&amp;address=443+Emerson+Street&amp;city=palo+alto&amp;state=ca&amp;zipcode=">map</a> for those who need one. Getting to Jing Jing from the Palto Alto Caltrain station is a snap too, for those coming in by train. Take Lytton the only way you can, left onto Emerson, Jing Jing is visable from that corner less than a block away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a &#8220;Feed Of The Day&#8221; feature on the <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster home page</a>. See the thing in the middle of the page, right above the ridiculously large  count of feeds in the system? Basically, it&#8217;s a feed that someone at Feedster thinks is interesting. The responsibility had been falling to Chris and Beverly for a long time, and they had to spend a bunch of time every night casting about for a good feed to feature. Yesterday we decided to rotate the update, so that we take turns picking the feed of the day. My days are going to be Tuesdays and Thursdays, and last night was my first update. I put up Eleanor&#8217;s blog <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/">EllementK</a>, apparently sleeping with the judge does work :-) (For those who might not know, Eleanor is my girlfriend and we live together, just a little disclose there for those who are into that sort of thing). She&#8217;s working at NEC America doing research, and puts up a bunch of information about the projects she runs across in doing research, which ranges from <a href="http://ellementk.com/archives/category/enterprise-it/">Enterprise IT</a> (high availability infrastructure and grid computing) to <a href="http://ellementk.com/archives/category/mobility/">mobility</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.feedster.com/fotd.php">archive page</a> for the past Feed of the Day entries, which of course has it&#8217;s own <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?q=f-botd&amp;sort=date&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;limit=15&amp;type=rss">feed</a> that you can subscribe to. I was trying to decide if I should pick a theme for the feeds that I put up there. I&#8217;ve been into mobility and open source stuff for a long time, there are tons of resources on that stuff that I could call out. But that really sticks to the geeky stuff, and I wanted to throw in a little diversity. So if you have ideas, or if you think your feed kicks ass and I should use it as the Feed of the Day, leave a comment here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dave McClure asked <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2005/02/consolidation_2.html">imagine for just a moment that you&#8217;re Ballmer, Semel, or Schmidt and you&#8217;ve got a couple billion burning a hole in your pocket&#8211; what companies would you put on your shopping list?</a>. Interesting question. I would probably pick a ton of mobile companies. <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.buzznet.com">Buzznet</a>, <a href="http://www.wirelessink.com">WirelessInk</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,54630,00.html">LifeBlog</a>, <a href="http://www.audioblog.com/">Audioblog</a>, <a href="http://www.wavemarket.com/">WaveMarket</a>, and the list would go on for a while. And that&#8217;s just the first wave of services pretty much, looking to mobilize the existing practice of blogging. There are companies like <a href="http://www.caterpillarmobile.com/">Caterpillar Mobile</a> looking to evolve the models that started in the desktop-centric world into something more suited to personal devices situated in a larger environment. One or two billion dollars would sure get you a long way, but I&#8217;m not sure it would make it to complete buyout of the sector.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.106miles.org/">106miles</a> event last night. A big part of the Geek Krew were there: <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall</a> (who took audio and should have that up on his site at some point), <a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Eleanor</a>, <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russ Beattie</a>, and <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/">Brendon Wilson</a>. We&#8217;re starting to form a pretty consistent traveling discussion group. <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/">Michael Fagan</a> and Nick Heyman from <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> came also. I got to meet <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny</a> (who has <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004156.html">some comments up already</a>) and <a href="http://99zeros.blogspot.com/">Mark Jen</a> (see <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/09/1418233">this Slashdot post</a> for some background on why meeting Mark is interesting, and <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004157.html">these comments from Jeremy after meeting him last night also</a> for some additional info. Mark was fired by the way.). There were a ton of great people there, thank you <a href="http://troutgirl.blogspot.com/">Joyce</a>!! I took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/sets/113756/">a few pictures</a>. They came out pretty poorly but they&#8217;re there at least.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000283.html">Dave Sifry was the speaker</a>, here&#8217;s some of the points he made:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It takes just as much effort and pain and risk and stress to build a good small company as it does a good big company. So if you&#8217;re gonna pay the cost why not shoot for a big goal. Never underestimate the ability of a small team of dedicated people to change the world. Actually, that&#8217;s the way it always happens, with a small team of great people</p></li>
<li><p>The best way to get money from VCs is to ask for advice, the best way to get advice is to ask for money.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking money is the second worst thing that can happen to a business, the worst is going under. Dave says he doesn&#8217;t understand the mentality of announcing funding events.  It&#8217;s like announcing, &#8220;Yay! I took out a mortgage!&#8221; The best money to have comes from customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Want to start a great business?  Base it off one of the seven deadly sins. <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> is based off pride, it started cause Dave wanted to know what people were saying about him. It&#8217;s only a natural thing, people are social animals, everyone wants to know what others think of them.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Hey, look, I&#8217;m gonna screw up something major.&#8221; It&#8217;s good to be up front with your board and your investors. Failing is okay, just fail quickly, and be prepared to learn from it and try something different. (This is something I&#8217;ve heard all over the place by the way. It shows up in people talking about businesses and entrepreneurship, it shows up in <a href="http://eyepopping.manilasites.com/stories/storyReader$62">modeling and prototyping</a>, and it&#8217;s part of the underpinnings of the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile movement in software development</a>. Dave himself says that he&#8217;s not a great engineer, he&#8217;s a great prototyper. I think the skills necessary for prototyping and entrepreneurship probably overlap quite a bit).</p></li>
<li><p>Hire only fantastic people, never hire to fill a position without having the right match. Even a single poor person can sour a large team of great people. Pay attention to the fact that you&#8217;re building a culture, the concept of &#8220;corporate DNA&#8221; is very real. Technorati is built to have great culture, it&#8217;s a principal concern.</p></li>
<li><p>Date before you marry. Do research on your VCs. Know the differences between companies that fund at different stages. If you need seed there are very specific funds that look for early opportunities. If you walk into a VC that normally funds a different stage they&#8217;re just going to ignore you.</p></li>
<li><p>Give your board homework assignments. Yes you have an obligation to your board and your stock holders, but the board also has an obligation to the company. These are supposed to be the people out in the field, hearing important information in contact with important people. If you need something like a contact or to fill a position, ask your board.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog">Niall&#8217;s blog</a> if you want to hear the full audio.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m just catching up on some posts I&#8217;ve had sitting around as drafts (there are a lot of them actually).  I saw <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2005/01/31/viral_handheld_.html">this article</a> about Infected, a wireless game for Playstation Portable that has some viral dispersion features. That got me thinking about a whole bunch of different things, mostly around artificial life, the suitability of a wireless network to simulate a resource constrained environment for competition, and the modeling of distance in genetic programming. However, I realized the more fundamental question here might be how hackable are these interfaces? Could I, a normal unlicensed Linux developer with a decent background in wireless interfaces, write a program that ran on a Linux system and interacted with a Playstation Portable game? Could this be used to write plugins and enhancements for the games in the same way that people used to <a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/doomwads/tc.php">hack the description files for Doom</a>? I think it&#8217;s just an 802.11 interface, so it would be technically possible. But are the protocols closed off to allow only PSP to PSP communication? And how about the game data, protected or open?</p>

<p>The wireless interface presents an additional means of access to the game console that circumvents the traditional problems with getting content onto the device. Given that the &#8220;razor blade&#8221; model applies to most gaming consoles, that the unit itself is pretty much given away so that money can be made on the games, I&#8217;m not sure if incentives are aligned right for something like this. That&#8217;s supposed to be one of the great aspects of the taco (Nokia N-Gage), ability for just about anyone to easily deliver new games. For most gaming consoles the developers have to burn CDs or DVDs in proprietary formats or get their games blown into ROMs and put into special cartridges. Wireless interface, either with existing games or as a means of providing new games, allows the hacker (by which I mean curious and motivated expert user capable of extending and transforming the system) a lower barrier to entry for experimenting with your system. Hacker ecosystems like this are good for systems as a whole. Once a group of your users sees your products as something they don&#8217;t have to just accept &#8220;as is&#8221; they provide you with a completely different kind of feedback. If some of the expert users are able to service their own needs they can sometimes show you directions and evolutions that it would be difficult or impossible to reach on your own. If the Playstation Portable games don&#8217;t allow this kind of extension, is there a gaming system that does? How about flash cartridges that could be loaded over the air? These systems seem to be able to write game state. Does that go to the cartridge or to storage on the unit? Does anyone have a pure software SDK for their console? Hack the game together on a PC using an emulator or simulator, compile for the console target, load over the air onto flash cartridges, and then be able to distribute a version to beta testers they can use with their existing systems? It just sounds dirty and subversive. I would love to be able to do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On February 15th starting at 6pm is a Future Salon event titled <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/02/future_of_art_.html">Future of Art and Technology</a>. I&#8217;m not really familiar with any of the efforts or organizations listed there, so I&#8217;m going to learn about the stuff. For a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about hooking together biofeedback systems with the electronics commonly found at live events, spurred somewhat by reading <a href="http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/thediamondage.html">The Diamond Age</a> by Stephenson a while ago. It&#8217;s the merger of art, technology, and social systems like that which really gets my interest up. That&#8217;s one of the aspects that draws me to <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us">mobility</a>, and technologies like <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html">mesh networking</a>, <a href="http://www.tinyos.net/">TinyOS</a>, and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/29/0321219&amp;tid=158&amp;tid=172">hacking RFID to do more interesting stuff than it&#8217;s deployed to do</a>. When you allow the dialog of creation that the artist and audience engage in to compress to a realtime exchange (when the feedback loop is closed and direct) I think a state change happens. It&#8217;s a lot like the change in communication styles that happen between asyncronous and syncronous dialog everywhere else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got an email from Russ the other day saying &#8220;Hey, why isn&#8217;t your phone accepting calls?&#8221;  Sounded pretty weird, but not beyond belief, I normally have bad luck with billing systems.  I have an account at <a href="http://www.wamu.com/home.htm">Washington Mutual</a>, and for a while they seemed to be rejecting autopayments for no reason that anyone inside or outside the organization could determine.  I dialed my number from a landline and sure enough there was a message: &#8220;At the subscribers request, this line is no longer accepting incoming calls.&#8221; Very odd, I was DEFINITE I had not requested incoming calls be shut off. I logged into my Washington Mutual online system and checked the transactions on my account. Weird, it did show a payment processed to T-Mobile just the week before. So I assumed this was just some glitch in the <a href="http://www.tmobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> system and set about getting in touch with someone.</p>

<p>After trying to use their automated attendant and finding out about my bill, which depending on my position in the menu system was reported as either 164 dollars, 55 dollars, or fully paid, I was further convinced it was a glitch in their system. So I set about getting hold of a real person. That took three tries, I was dropped twice when trying to transfer out of the automated attendant. I&#8217;m not sure the exact hold time waiting for a live person, but it was a lot longer than I expected given my difficulty in getting through.</p>

<p>Once I did get through I got my answer however. It turns out my phone service got shut off because I had hit the credit limit assigned to my account. Interesting, because I have autopayment set up. The attendant informed me that this isn&#8217;t the way that autopayment works. If the balance on my account is more than my credit limit it gets shut off without notification. Their justification for this is that they gave me a letter back when I signed up for the account saying that if I had exceeded my credit limit they might shut off my phone service.</p>

<p>This had got to be the fucking stupidest thing I have ever heard of in my life. I&#8217;m just completely floored by how moronic these carriers are. First of all, an autopayment system that leaves a user without service is stupid on its own. But even once we make it past that bit of lunacy, they did this without sending me any notification. No phone call, no SMS, not even smoke signals. Yes, they did give me a letter saying they might &#8220;shut off my service without notification&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the right move in terms of customer service. I figured that meant if I got to my spending limit and they couldn&#8217;t contact me they might shut it off. That they (my phone company, the people PROVIDING ME WITH COMMUNICATION!) would shut off my phone without trying to communicate is something I didn&#8217;t even consider. How do these people expect to sell the advantages of connectedness when they ignore their channel themselves? Most companies are avoiding SMS communications because the carriers want to rape them on the service charge. But for <a href="http://www.tmobile.com">my carrier</a> not to use SMS for notification over their own network is just <a href="http://www.tmobile.com">stupidity</a>. Obviously they&#8217;ve missed the boat on the idea as a whole. With <a href="http://engadget.com/entry/6944052294116838/">3G from T-Mobile so far off on the horizon</a> and then this little gem, it&#8217;s time for me to switch carriers.</p>
