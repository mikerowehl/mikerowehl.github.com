  <div class="entry-content"><p>Greg Gershman from Blogdigger is <a href="http://www.blogdigger.com/blog/2005/02/14/1108421226000.html">in town for a little bit</a> and wanted to do a get together.  The plan is to meet up at Jing Jing downtown Palo Alto at 6:30pm on Wed Feb 16th. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&amp;country=US&amp;addtohistory=&amp;searchtab=home&amp;address=443+Emerson+Street&amp;city=palo+alto&amp;state=ca&amp;zipcode=">map</a> for those who need one. Getting to Jing Jing from the Palto Alto Caltrain station is a snap too, for those coming in by train. Take Lytton the only way you can, left onto Emerson, Jing Jing is visable from that corner less than a block away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a &#8220;Feed Of The Day&#8221; feature on the <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster home page</a>. See the thing in the middle of the page, right above the ridiculously large  count of feeds in the system? Basically, it&#8217;s a feed that someone at Feedster thinks is interesting. The responsibility had been falling to Chris and Beverly for a long time, and they had to spend a bunch of time every night casting about for a good feed to feature. Yesterday we decided to rotate the update, so that we take turns picking the feed of the day. My days are going to be Tuesdays and Thursdays, and last night was my first update. I put up Eleanor&#8217;s blog <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/">EllementK</a>, apparently sleeping with the judge does work :-) (For those who might not know, Eleanor is my girlfriend and we live together, just a little disclose there for those who are into that sort of thing). She&#8217;s working at NEC America doing research, and puts up a bunch of information about the projects she runs across in doing research, which ranges from <a href="http://ellementk.com/archives/category/enterprise-it/">Enterprise IT</a> (high availability infrastructure and grid computing) to <a href="http://ellementk.com/archives/category/mobility/">mobility</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.feedster.com/fotd.php">archive page</a> for the past Feed of the Day entries, which of course has it&#8217;s own <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?q=f-botd&amp;sort=date&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;limit=15&amp;type=rss">feed</a> that you can subscribe to. I was trying to decide if I should pick a theme for the feeds that I put up there. I&#8217;ve been into mobility and open source stuff for a long time, there are tons of resources on that stuff that I could call out. But that really sticks to the geeky stuff, and I wanted to throw in a little diversity. So if you have ideas, or if you think your feed kicks ass and I should use it as the Feed of the Day, leave a comment here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dave McClure asked <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2005/02/consolidation_2.html">imagine for just a moment that you&#8217;re Ballmer, Semel, or Schmidt and you&#8217;ve got a couple billion burning a hole in your pocket&#8211; what companies would you put on your shopping list?</a>. Interesting question. I would probably pick a ton of mobile companies. <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.buzznet.com">Buzznet</a>, <a href="http://www.wirelessink.com">WirelessInk</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,54630,00.html">LifeBlog</a>, <a href="http://www.audioblog.com/">Audioblog</a>, <a href="http://www.wavemarket.com/">WaveMarket</a>, and the list would go on for a while. And that&#8217;s just the first wave of services pretty much, looking to mobilize the existing practice of blogging. There are companies like <a href="http://www.caterpillarmobile.com/">Caterpillar Mobile</a> looking to evolve the models that started in the desktop-centric world into something more suited to personal devices situated in a larger environment. One or two billion dollars would sure get you a long way, but I&#8217;m not sure it would make it to complete buyout of the sector.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.106miles.org/">106miles</a> event last night. A big part of the Geek Krew were there: <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall</a> (who took audio and should have that up on his site at some point), <a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Eleanor</a>, <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russ Beattie</a>, and <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/">Brendon Wilson</a>. We&#8217;re starting to form a pretty consistent traveling discussion group. <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/">Michael Fagan</a> and Nick Heyman from <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> came also. I got to meet <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny</a> (who has <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004156.html">some comments up already</a>) and <a href="http://99zeros.blogspot.com/">Mark Jen</a> (see <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/09/1418233">this Slashdot post</a> for some background on why meeting Mark is interesting, and <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004157.html">these comments from Jeremy after meeting him last night also</a> for some additional info. Mark was fired by the way.). There were a ton of great people there, thank you <a href="http://troutgirl.blogspot.com/">Joyce</a>!! I took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/sets/113756/">a few pictures</a>. They came out pretty poorly but they&#8217;re there at least.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000283.html">Dave Sifry was the speaker</a>, here&#8217;s some of the points he made:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It takes just as much effort and pain and risk and stress to build a good small company as it does a good big company. So if you&#8217;re gonna pay the cost why not shoot for a big goal. Never underestimate the ability of a small team of dedicated people to change the world. Actually, that&#8217;s the way it always happens, with a small team of great people</p></li>
<li><p>The best way to get money from VCs is to ask for advice, the best way to get advice is to ask for money.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking money is the second worst thing that can happen to a business, the worst is going under. Dave says he doesn&#8217;t understand the mentality of announcing funding events.  It&#8217;s like announcing, &#8220;Yay! I took out a mortgage!&#8221; The best money to have comes from customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Want to start a great business?  Base it off one of the seven deadly sins. <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> is based off pride, it started cause Dave wanted to know what people were saying about him. It&#8217;s only a natural thing, people are social animals, everyone wants to know what others think of them.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Hey, look, I&#8217;m gonna screw up something major.&#8221; It&#8217;s good to be up front with your board and your investors. Failing is okay, just fail quickly, and be prepared to learn from it and try something different. (This is something I&#8217;ve heard all over the place by the way. It shows up in people talking about businesses and entrepreneurship, it shows up in <a href="http://eyepopping.manilasites.com/stories/storyReader$62">modeling and prototyping</a>, and it&#8217;s part of the underpinnings of the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile movement in software development</a>. Dave himself says that he&#8217;s not a great engineer, he&#8217;s a great prototyper. I think the skills necessary for prototyping and entrepreneurship probably overlap quite a bit).</p></li>
<li><p>Hire only fantastic people, never hire to fill a position without having the right match. Even a single poor person can sour a large team of great people. Pay attention to the fact that you&#8217;re building a culture, the concept of &#8220;corporate DNA&#8221; is very real. Technorati is built to have great culture, it&#8217;s a principal concern.</p></li>
<li><p>Date before you marry. Do research on your VCs. Know the differences between companies that fund at different stages. If you need seed there are very specific funds that look for early opportunities. If you walk into a VC that normally funds a different stage they&#8217;re just going to ignore you.</p></li>
<li><p>Give your board homework assignments. Yes you have an obligation to your board and your stock holders, but the board also has an obligation to the company. These are supposed to be the people out in the field, hearing important information in contact with important people. If you need something like a contact or to fill a position, ask your board.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog">Niall&#8217;s blog</a> if you want to hear the full audio.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m just catching up on some posts I&#8217;ve had sitting around as drafts (there are a lot of them actually).  I saw <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2005/01/31/viral_handheld_.html">this article</a> about Infected, a wireless game for Playstation Portable that has some viral dispersion features. That got me thinking about a whole bunch of different things, mostly around artificial life, the suitability of a wireless network to simulate a resource constrained environment for competition, and the modeling of distance in genetic programming. However, I realized the more fundamental question here might be how hackable are these interfaces? Could I, a normal unlicensed Linux developer with a decent background in wireless interfaces, write a program that ran on a Linux system and interacted with a Playstation Portable game? Could this be used to write plugins and enhancements for the games in the same way that people used to <a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/doomwads/tc.php">hack the description files for Doom</a>? I think it&#8217;s just an 802.11 interface, so it would be technically possible. But are the protocols closed off to allow only PSP to PSP communication? And how about the game data, protected or open?</p>

<p>The wireless interface presents an additional means of access to the game console that circumvents the traditional problems with getting content onto the device. Given that the &#8220;razor blade&#8221; model applies to most gaming consoles, that the unit itself is pretty much given away so that money can be made on the games, I&#8217;m not sure if incentives are aligned right for something like this. That&#8217;s supposed to be one of the great aspects of the taco (Nokia N-Gage), ability for just about anyone to easily deliver new games. For most gaming consoles the developers have to burn CDs or DVDs in proprietary formats or get their games blown into ROMs and put into special cartridges. Wireless interface, either with existing games or as a means of providing new games, allows the hacker (by which I mean curious and motivated expert user capable of extending and transforming the system) a lower barrier to entry for experimenting with your system. Hacker ecosystems like this are good for systems as a whole. Once a group of your users sees your products as something they don&#8217;t have to just accept &#8220;as is&#8221; they provide you with a completely different kind of feedback. If some of the expert users are able to service their own needs they can sometimes show you directions and evolutions that it would be difficult or impossible to reach on your own. If the Playstation Portable games don&#8217;t allow this kind of extension, is there a gaming system that does? How about flash cartridges that could be loaded over the air? These systems seem to be able to write game state. Does that go to the cartridge or to storage on the unit? Does anyone have a pure software SDK for their console? Hack the game together on a PC using an emulator or simulator, compile for the console target, load over the air onto flash cartridges, and then be able to distribute a version to beta testers they can use with their existing systems? It just sounds dirty and subversive. I would love to be able to do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On February 15th starting at 6pm is a Future Salon event titled <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/02/future_of_art_.html">Future of Art and Technology</a>. I&#8217;m not really familiar with any of the efforts or organizations listed there, so I&#8217;m going to learn about the stuff. For a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about hooking together biofeedback systems with the electronics commonly found at live events, spurred somewhat by reading <a href="http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/thediamondage.html">The Diamond Age</a> by Stephenson a while ago. It&#8217;s the merger of art, technology, and social systems like that which really gets my interest up. That&#8217;s one of the aspects that draws me to <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us">mobility</a>, and technologies like <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html">mesh networking</a>, <a href="http://www.tinyos.net/">TinyOS</a>, and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/29/0321219&amp;tid=158&amp;tid=172">hacking RFID to do more interesting stuff than it&#8217;s deployed to do</a>. When you allow the dialog of creation that the artist and audience engage in to compress to a realtime exchange (when the feedback loop is closed and direct) I think a state change happens. It&#8217;s a lot like the change in communication styles that happen between asyncronous and syncronous dialog everywhere else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got an email from Russ the other day saying &#8220;Hey, why isn&#8217;t your phone accepting calls?&#8221;  Sounded pretty weird, but not beyond belief, I normally have bad luck with billing systems.  I have an account at <a href="http://www.wamu.com/home.htm">Washington Mutual</a>, and for a while they seemed to be rejecting autopayments for no reason that anyone inside or outside the organization could determine.  I dialed my number from a landline and sure enough there was a message: &#8220;At the subscribers request, this line is no longer accepting incoming calls.&#8221; Very odd, I was DEFINITE I had not requested incoming calls be shut off. I logged into my Washington Mutual online system and checked the transactions on my account. Weird, it did show a payment processed to T-Mobile just the week before. So I assumed this was just some glitch in the <a href="http://www.tmobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> system and set about getting in touch with someone.</p>

<p>After trying to use their automated attendant and finding out about my bill, which depending on my position in the menu system was reported as either 164 dollars, 55 dollars, or fully paid, I was further convinced it was a glitch in their system. So I set about getting hold of a real person. That took three tries, I was dropped twice when trying to transfer out of the automated attendant. I&#8217;m not sure the exact hold time waiting for a live person, but it was a lot longer than I expected given my difficulty in getting through.</p>

<p>Once I did get through I got my answer however. It turns out my phone service got shut off because I had hit the credit limit assigned to my account. Interesting, because I have autopayment set up. The attendant informed me that this isn&#8217;t the way that autopayment works. If the balance on my account is more than my credit limit it gets shut off without notification. Their justification for this is that they gave me a letter back when I signed up for the account saying that if I had exceeded my credit limit they might shut off my phone service.</p>

<p>This had got to be the fucking stupidest thing I have ever heard of in my life. I&#8217;m just completely floored by how moronic these carriers are. First of all, an autopayment system that leaves a user without service is stupid on its own. But even once we make it past that bit of lunacy, they did this without sending me any notification. No phone call, no SMS, not even smoke signals. Yes, they did give me a letter saying they might &#8220;shut off my service without notification&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the right move in terms of customer service. I figured that meant if I got to my spending limit and they couldn&#8217;t contact me they might shut it off. That they (my phone company, the people PROVIDING ME WITH COMMUNICATION!) would shut off my phone without trying to communicate is something I didn&#8217;t even consider. How do these people expect to sell the advantages of connectedness when they ignore their channel themselves? Most companies are avoiding SMS communications because the carriers want to rape them on the service charge. But for <a href="http://www.tmobile.com">my carrier</a> not to use SMS for notification over their own network is just <a href="http://www.tmobile.com">stupidity</a>. Obviously they&#8217;ve missed the boat on the idea as a whole. With <a href="http://engadget.com/entry/6944052294116838/">3G from T-Mobile so far off on the horizon</a> and then this little gem, it&#8217;s time for me to switch carriers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/">Randy</a> seems to have some momentum going for his <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/usm.html">Universal Subscription Mechanism</a> proposal. The basic idea is that we deal with some content types specific to RSS and Atom so that the browser can shove the handling off to an external app that then push the subscribe URL into something that knows what to do with it. Not a bad idea, but I like <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=388">my idea for a subscription service</a> better. However, if people think that the proposal Randy made is the way to go I don&#8217;t want to be a bad sport. I just want things to be simple and work by default. So I hacked together a <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/usm.txt">Python USM handler</a> that works for me under Linux using <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a>. I&#8217;m on the train right now, and testing it out against a lot of feeds is a pain over this GPRS connection, so I just tried a few. Using it should be pretty simple. Right now it only handles launching a browser with the <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> subscribe URL, but the hackers out there can change that if they want I&#8217;m sure. I&#8217;ll make it config file driven with some command line options to set the subscription action at some point.</p>

<p>What I would like to do with this is have it pull both the HTML URL and subscription URL and shove that off into my Wordpress link manager &#8220;add link&#8221; function. Maybe that&#8217;ll be the next set of hacking, depending how many blogs I happen across that support USM. Mine doesn&#8217;t :-)  Guess I need the latest latest version of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>Update: I messed up the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/usm.txt">link to the code</a> before. Ooops. I probably can&#8217;t blame that on the bouncing of the train, but I&#8217;m going to try anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The most major news item in mobility yesterday seems to be <a href="http://www.symbian.com/press-office/2005/pr050202.html">the new release of Symbian OS</a>. The 9.0 version doesn&#8217;t really include many new features that affect the end user, as called out in <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101397">a post at TheFeature</a>. The USB mass storage feature will actually be pretty cool, but doesn&#8217;t really affect me all that much because I use Bluetooth to fling files over to my phone. The 3D graphics are nice to see, lots of people are really enthusiastic about the games market. But personally I&#8217;m more into the location based and alternate reality games than high framerate 3D. This release seems to concentrate a lot more on the capabilities meant for network operators, and I agree with a lot of the sentiments expressed in the article from TheFeature. There&#8217;s been a lot of  talk about the openness of mobile platforms, the most recent bump in activity seeming to start around <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101299&amp;ref=5451994">Mobile and Open</a> from Howard Rheingold (something I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=385">already commented on</a>). During the past few days I also happened across two sets of commentary from Cory Doctorow, the first an article titled <a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/computers/article/0,20967,1021279,00.html">Take Back Your Cell</a> and the second an <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101373&amp;ref=5451994">interview with Cory at TheFeature</a>. This is a drum I&#8217;ve beat plenty of times in the past, that openness is necessary for innovation. Interesting applications come from users seeing new possibilities, not from manufacturers pushing out incremental features. So I&#8217;m kinda concerned that the Symbian 9.0 release seems to be tending toward more closed instead of more open.</p>

<p>When I went to Nokia TechDays they spoke somewhat about the new OTA (Over The Air) features, but most of what they spoke about was being able to debug a malfunctioning application in the field. That part is cool. However the mention of OTA auditing, along with DRM, really makes me uneasy. Things just seem to be trending in the wrong direction in this area. I would really love to see some Linux based handsets out in the general market.  There&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php">really interesting stuff</a> working on Linux handhelds, which I think could be easily transferred to Linux handsets. Unfortunately everyone is thinking evolution and not revolution when it comes to deploying things like this. Of course the network operators aren&#8217;t going to like it very much, and the existing manufacturers view it as a threat. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t the right direction long term. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not the best outcome for the end users. Everyone is thinking within the framework of the existing business models, and that&#8217;s pretty sad.</p>
