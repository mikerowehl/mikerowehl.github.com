  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Gillmor is going to be <a href="http://www.ebig.org/sig/sig.aspx?SIGid=36">speaking at the next eBig Blogging and RSS SIG meeting</a>. The topic is AttentionXML:</p>

<blockquote><p>Steve Gillmor, journalist with eWeek, will join us to talk about AttentionXML, a concept he&#8217;s been instrumental in forming.   AttentionXML is a new technology initiative that will present a richer view than that available through just a static list of rss feeds.  This new standard, still under discussion and development, will help you manage your blogroll, turning it from a list into an interactive, filtered stream of content.</p></blockquote>

<p>The event is a ways outside of my normal stomping ground, but well worth the trip.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/february-7th-2005-meeting.html">posted info about the February 7th 2005 MobileMonday meeting</a>. We have a stunning lineup of speakers this time around, I&#8217;m really excited about this.</p>

<p>We had a Mobile Hackers meeting a few days ago, but nothing really came of it. Russ asked everyone to bring some running code, but that didn&#8217;t work out so well. Some people didn&#8217;t have anything at all, some had demo apps but no code, and the hacking never really got underway. As I mentioned before I&#8217;ve started playing around with <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=392">Python on the Series 60</a>, and would like to see if I can get some tools cobbled together that scratch some of my own itches. So if you&#8217;re interested in hacking on some Python stuff snag me at the meeting and we&#8217;ll talk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/momo-tech-gathering.html">the mobile geekout tonight</a> I finally got around to installing and mucking around with <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,034-821,00.html">Python for the Series 60</a>. I haven&#8217;t had time to really explore the boundaries yet, but what I have played with has been fantastic. Check out the <a href="http://www.postneo.com/postwiki/moin.cgi/PythonForSeries60">Python for Series 60 wiki page</a> for more info. I took the Bluetooth GPS example there to fool around with. I put up <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/series60_python/bluetooth_samples_1.txt">a version of the code with indentation preserved</a>.  I&#8217;ll post more about it as I play around some. Like some info about the remote console over Bluetooth. In my estimation this beats their halfassed C++ environment and simulator. That simulator just keeps pissing me off. Every time I think I have it working something else goes wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As is probably abundantly obvious from the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">front page at Feedster</a>.  We originally expected that the downtime would be Friday afternoon, but there were some snags (I would point you to Scott Johnson&#8217;s post, but apparently it&#8217;s on the servers that are currently down, d&#8217;oh!). So this is a planned upgrade, not some crash or hack we have to deal with. The rapid growth in the number of new feeds appearing on the Internet, and the effort that <a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">Ray</a> has made to get all of them to parse and to get more of them added to the index faster, ended up overwhelming the servers. When the site comes back up hopefully it&#8217;ll be snappier and more robust, thanks in no small part to <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/?guid=20041221192907">the work that Nick Heyman has done since recently joining</a> (Nick, you need a blog so that I have something to point to when I talk about you).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran into <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">Tantek</a> last night at <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008256.html">Russ&#8217;s birthday party</a>, and talking with him reminded me that I never updated my blog to include <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN info</a>. <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> includes a nice simple XFN generator for the links section, so I decided to use that. I had originally populated the links with an import of the OPML from Bloglines, so adding the relationship info was a snap. Then I started thinking about keeping the info up to date, and synced in the different places it needs to live. Since Wordpress manages the XFN info for me, and publishes it, I figured using Wordpress as the authoritative source would be a good idea.</p>

<p>The two major places that I want my info are here on my blog and in <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, the web based aggregator I use. I figured it would be pretty easy to get Bloglines to sync with Wordpress in a repeatable manner, but not quite. First I figured I would just be able to look at some URLs and create a bookmarklet in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">FireFox</a> to import the OPML into bloglines based on the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/wp-links-opml.php">OPML export</a> that Wordpress does. But it turns out that Bloglines wants the OPML uploaded as a file. Not a big deal, but I&#8217;m surprised they don&#8217;t take a URL for that import field. After fooling around a bit to make sure that multiple import will work the way I expect I ran into two issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bloglines treats the first category it hits as the base folder, so one category of feeds was getting dumped into the root instead of their own location. I just created a dummy category in Wordpress to appear as the first category in the OPML and I ignore it.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time I import the folders get duplicated. The new copy is empty, so they&#8217;re easy to delete out, and it doesn&#8217;t mess with the status of the feeds or anything. But it&#8217;s annoying. This was a real pain, I want my links to just sync between the services.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So I have a simple, <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/wp-to-bloglines.txt">effectively three line perl script</a> that I should be able to just throw in cron to sync my feeds, but instead I have to run it by hand. The goal would be a bookmarklet that adds the current page into my Wordpress links so that I can add XFN info, and somewhere in the background have something sync the feed for my new friend over to Bloglines. I don&#8217;t know if that reimport problem with Bloglines is a well known issue or not, but I submitted a note to see what they say. If that was working well it would be a cool feature to add syncing with Bloglines directly into Wordpress. I could just parse the Javascript to figure out the structure of the folders and delete out the dupes, but that just smacks of effort.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to <a href="http://www.vlab.org/204.cfm?eventID=49">a presentation at Stanford VLAB titled &#8220;Bringing Great Open Source Ideas to Market&#8221;</a> earlier this week. There were some interesting comments made, and I&#8217;ll get some of those down here. First I want to mention the overall message however: &#8220;2005 will be the breakout year for open source&#8221;. Good message, the spirit is right, but I don&#8217;t agree. I&#8217;m not at all an expert in terms of business predictions and industry tracking, but I have been writing open source since 1992 so I am familiar with parts of it. In particular I am familiar with this part of it. And as someone working within that community I can assure you that every year since about 1996 has been predicted as &#8220;the breakout year for open source&#8221;. The predictions are always made by people already working on or with open source, and every year something generally described as &#8220;business concerns&#8221; keeps it from happening. So although I&#8217;m always happy to hear it, I&#8217;m no longer moved by the prediction. What is happening, and what will continue to happen, is the accelerating adoption of open source. It might look something like a breakout to people within the particular industries that have picked up open source. However open source is already exploding on the market. Has exploded on the market even. It might seem like something new if you normally work with application servers and middleware, but go ask someone in embedded systems about Linux. It&#8217;s out there already. It&#8217;s just moving from lower levels like the kernel to higher levels like web service infrastructure (much as I&#8217;ve moved from embedded systems programming to working at <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a>, the parallel is not coincidental). What&#8217;s evolving is the business model to go along with it, which is exactly what Marc Fleury was talking about. So certainly kudos to him on that one.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to call out some of the points that I found most interesting. Mark at Indexed Forever <a href="http://indexedforever.com/index.php?p=32">has already posted</a> with some info also. For me the most salient point was the generations of open source business model. He put down three of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No business model - most projects</p></li>
<li><p>Packaging - like <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/suse/">SUSE</a> and <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Redhat</a></p></li>
<li><p>Professional - like <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>He drew the distinction between the packaging companies and the professional open source companies by saying that packaging companies act as an interface to the open source community while professional open source companies ARE the community. Professional open source companies employ all of the major contributers to a project. They can do that because they are the ones that drove the project through critical mass. They might be the original authors of the software, but not necessarily. They do have to be the current wardens for the most popular branch. Because they do have all the major contributors to the project, and deep knowledge about the system, they can provide the kind of support that extends beyond answering user questions and gets into transforming the package to deliver greater value. Which is important because you can&#8217;t charge for licenses (past value created) but for support and maintenance (future value that could be delivered). Nice point, it lies pretty well in line with what I&#8217;ve seen over time. It certainly explains the great success that MySQL has had, and why there is so much buzz over JBoss these days. I would offer something of a counterexample in <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/ximian.html">Ximian</a>. Although I know some people would call acquisition by Novell success, while others would say it was the reason for the project not diffusing as far as it could have. I&#8217;m not saying that invalidates the principle however, just another datapoint to keep in mind as the model evolves.</p>

<p>He made a few other points about scaling the project also. First of all, if you do have a project that has critical mass and you are positioned well, you&#8217;ll need to have a good way to filter leads. As an open source based company you&#8217;ll have a lot of users, and only a small subset of those will be customers. Traditional companies aren&#8217;t structured like this, and it can actually be a great asset to be sitting at the hub and facilitating all the discussions that go on about the project. But you have to have a much different salesforce because of that, not everyone understands the transition. You&#8217;ll need salespeople who can filter the huge amount of info and figure out which are leads to profitable customers. That&#8217;s much different than the salesperson who understands going out and hunting down a license sale. He also made a point about choosing metrics to measure your progress.  That can be number of downloads, cvs commits, number of support emails. The metric should be chosen based on what particular goal you have for the stage your at. Although I don&#8217;t think this is what Marc said directly, I took this as calling out the measurable marketing you have at your disposal when you&#8217;re running as an open source company. You can see how the community is growing, how your message is making it out there, how people are using the system and what they want done. The increased transparency of open source goes both ways. Not only do your customers have more insight into what you&#8217;re doing and how you do it, but you should be able to get more insight into what they need and how they&#8217;re looking at solving their problems. If you can take advantage of that it&#8217;s a very good thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I upgraded my <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> install today. I&#8217;ve been getting a ton of comment spam, and instead of hacking my aging install to deal with it I want to hack a new install. Wordpress has served me really well, and I love the features, so instead of being a punter and just downloading the latest release, I installed the version from CVS instead. Matt said <a href="http://photomatt.net/2005/01/12/no-spam/">there are all kinds of antispam things that seem to be working</a>, so I&#8217;ll give them a try. And hack if I have issues.</p>

<p>The main problem I have when upgrading is my non-standard template. I do a lot of mobile stuff, and standard site designs are always a pain when viewed from a mobile device. So I always end up stripping things down to a very simple layout that scales from phone to PDA to desktop sizes. Some people don&#8217;t like the lack of normal interface elements, but in general I think it&#8217;s what I want. I was going to leave the original template up so that there are two versions of the site, one for people that want to see the standard website elements and my minimalist layout. I discovered that Wordpress now uses templated themes, which did actually make it difficult to just store the original index.php as desktop.php and hack index.php into what I wanted. But I did hack up a <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/stark.tgz">theme called Stark</a> that approximates what I&#8217;m going for. There&#8217;s some user specific info embedded in there now, like links for my email address, Flickr, and Buzznet. So there it is, mas hacking will ensue I think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to see <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?id=1099686006">Steve Case give an interview at the Computer History Museum</a> tonight. It was actually kinda boring, but some points were made. Here are some notes from me, heavily editorialized by me, only vaguely based on what they were talking about on stage.</p>

<p>Steve made a point about the early online services market being heavily segmented based on the kind of device that was being used to access the network. Prodigy was aimed at IBM PC users and <a href="http://www2.ari.net/home/jpurkey/qlink.html">QLink</a> was aimed at Commodore users. There&#8217;s a big difference between the person who pays $2000 for a PC and one who pays $200 for a C64, and naturally the online market was segmented based on those big differences. Interesting. In general we think of all service as pretty much the same these days. There&#8217;s broadband and dialup, but we don&#8217;t think of a particular provider as &#8220;a Windows service&#8221; or a &#8220;Linux service&#8221;. They all go out to the Internet on the back end, so who really cares? Well, if we move toward computers embedded in the world around us - our phones, our entertainment systems, our cars, etc. - the access devices does become a significant predictor of what might be interesting. I wonder if we&#8217;ll see a proliferation of network providers as the Lexus Network Service Provider attempts to segment itself from the Hyundai provider.</p>

<p>Mentioned that he personally worked out the deal with Apple that got setup for AppleLink (or one of the services at least, I can&#8217;t remember which). It was the first and last time Apple ever licensed it&#8217;s logo to a third party. He did mention that Apple had such a strong tradition of charging for software that a free bundle with the Apple logo would cause quite a stir.</p>

<p>At the end, he was commenting on communication and collaboration within non-profit organizations and the medical field. This is a hot topic and seemingly getting hotter. He was interested in how to raise the effectiveness of the organizations without just throwing money from a profitable area into a lossy area. Community building and collaboration seemed to be his concentrations, as they were in building AOL. No concrete info on what kinds of techniques for building cooperation he saw really making a difference.</p>

<p>When asked about weblogs he said he loves them.  The great thing about weblogs is that anyone can be a publisher.  The bad thing is that most people make bad publishers.  There will still be value in brand and trust for a long time because of this. People want a source they can turn to for authority, especially within journalism and the news.</p>

<p>Niall posted <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/tags/stevecase/">a few pics from the event already</a>. <a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> and I met up with Niall and a few other people and headed out afterward. The conversation after the event and at dinner was great, some fantastic people out here in the Bay Area. We had to cut it short however. Because, <em>gasp</em>, everyone had to go to work the next day. That&#8217;s been a rare consideration for quite a while. For a long time it seemed like any gathering of 4 or more people would tend to see half of them unemployed or self-employed, and therefor blissfully unaware of time. Could it be that the next rise is happening? Might be. I wonder if restaurants will cut back their hours now that people are forced to get back on human schedules.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was having trouble uploading to both <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.buzznet.com">Buzznet</a>, so I thought maybe something really funky had happened to my phone. But I emailed Flickr and Buzznet both anyway, and now Flickr has responded saying they fixed a bug in their code. Behold, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/3279546/">it works</a>!! That was really odd, that <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=378">both started failing when I went out to my parents</a>. Because I hadn&#8217;t changed any settings at all, I figured something might be up other than user error. Taking a look at it from the other side however, I know users always say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t change anything, and it just stopped working&#8221;. So I wasn&#8217;t sure how serious my requests were going to get looked at. Apparently seriously enough. I do think it some odd issue with the way that the 6600 formats emails send via SMTP. So if you have a Nokia 6600 and have been having some issues, Flickr at least seems to be working again. By the way, both seemed to work when I sent via MMS. On TMobile at least, you can send MMS to an email address and their system relays the message out to the Internet. However, I get charged MMS prices for that, and I get charged nothing extra to send an email thanks to my flat rate data plan. So if you&#8217;re seeing the same kinds of things, MMS might be a workaround.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="http://ellementk.com/archives/2005/01/12/271">Elle has already mentioned</a>, we were less than impressed with the ease of use and fluid experience that is the crippled MP3 player called the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. Everything about this device seems to scream out &#8220;access denied&#8221;. They should have a little loop of Job trying to escape the simulation at the end of <a href="http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jirwin/reviews/lawnmowerman.html">Lawnmower Man</a> preloaded, so that at least you&#8217;ll have SOME audio content to accompany the blinking lights. Cause Apple doesn&#8217;t really seem to be interested in letting you put your own on there.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve never been one to back down from a challenge, especially when it comes to getting some sleek little device to respect my wishes. So of course I hook it up under <a href="http://www.kernel.org">Linux</a> and start prodding around. I&#8217;m a 100% Linux user.  My desktops run Linux, my laptop runs Linux, the servers I work on run Linux. So I grabbed <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnupod/">GNUpod</a> and started playing around. Same problem however. Blinking error lights and no music. So I poked around for a while and found the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=52976">excellent docs from the iPod on Linux project</a>. Looks like the format might have changed.  A quick comparison of a file inserted via iTunes and the same file inserted via GNUpod yields quite a bit of difference. So I can only assume that the file format has changed. Which leads me to the obvious question, who else is planning to hack this out of spite? Sure, my hackage of the format just yeilds a larger base they can sell to for them. But somewhere deep down I hope that the message of openness yielding a larger base of users will make it back up to Apple. And that one day I can purchase one of their sleek and sexy machines, sit with it perched on my knees for hours on end while using a wireless connection, and not have to give up the ability to do what I want how I want. Probably not how it works out, but I&#8217;m a romantic or something. Maybe I&#8217;m just stupid. So who else is up for collecting iTunesDB files and doing a little reverse engineering?</p>

<p>By the way, I feel it only fair to mention that I would love to be able to make devices like this. When I was doing embedded systems development we spent a whole lot of time figuring out how to make the devices easy to use, reduce the install requirements, make the system reliable, return meaningful errors to the user when all else fails, and interoperate as widely as we could. There is no reason for some of the things that Apple has done with this player. Sure, maybe they use the iTunesDB format so that they can store extra information about the playlists. Better user experience, fine, well done. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the player can&#8217;t just play tracks from the root directory of the filesystem in the absence of an iTunesDB file (well, one reason I can think of, but it has little to do with servicing the user and everything to do with business model). It&#8217;s servicing the needs of the manufacturer and not the user, and I thought that was something to be avoided. At least that&#8217;s what my experience and reading had yielded. Apparently there&#8217;s an alternative, making the device white. Man, I should have thought of that! Maybe I should get a can of white paint and get back into embedded systems. These little things where flying off the shelves.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s only partially sarcasm of course, cause I am really thinking about the media ecosystem that Apple has created.  How their control from iTunes &#8220;service in the sky&#8221; down to device has allowed them to integrate the experience and not have to be concerned about the edge cases. &#8220;Wringing inefficiences out of the delivery chain&#8221; some might say. But I think what I&#8217;m thinking is &#8220;Wow, life in general could suck if they turn this advantage into a stranglehold&#8221;. Which probably isn&#8217;t how most people think about it. But then again lots of people thought &#8220;Wow, now my hardware will all just work on its own without me having to edit config files&#8221; when they first installed Windows 95.  And I think most would agree that the experience there has been less than painless. I&#8217;m not saying this is exactly the same situation, just that it should be kept in mind. We&#8217;re seeing the same gameboard getting set up, in my mind at least, with the <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008227.html">walled garden</a> mentality that mobile service providers have ressurected. I say ressurected cause it&#8217;s exactly the same play that AOL was going for when they felt threatened by the Internet. Fortunately it seems like openness always wins out when it comes to these battles. Network effects are simply stronger than the hold one party can keep on the system. I hope that&#8217;s a general rule and we see it happen again and again.</p>
