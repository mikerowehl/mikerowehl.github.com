  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been paying attention to the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=tagging+AND+%28+Flickr+OR+del.icio.us+OR+Buzznet+OR+Technorati+%29&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sort=date">discussions about tagging</a> (or <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=folksonomy+OR+folksonomies&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sort=date">folksonomies</a> depending on who you talk to). Some of the concepts are very appealing. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us/miker">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://mikerowehl.buzznet.com/user">Buzznet</a> long enough to understand the usage patterns there. But the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">recent addition of tagging to Technorati</a> has really opened up some new doors. I was <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/digital_identit.html">at the Future Salon chatting with Niall about some of them</a>, so I had tagging fresh in my mind when the presentation started and that seems to have kicked off a few ideas.</p>

<p>Arguably, this all has something to do with me asking <a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> if anyone else calls that big hill behind Stanford with the satellite dish on it &#8220;Satellite Hill&#8221;. That&#8217;s the question that kicked off a rather abstract discussion about naming, which led to a joke about folksonomies, and only later worked it&#8217;s way back into my conscious mind when I went back to tag my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/sets/99893/">photos from the event</a>. I found that someone else had posted images from another event using the futuresalon tag, so I did the same. Of course that means I was paying attention to the tagging I was doing and aligning my usage with others for the benefit of the commons. If I wanted to be all formal I would say something like I paid attention to the taxonomy that someone else had used and then matched myself to it. But what that really means in this case is that I was able to guess the tag that someone else used and then make use of it myself. Because of that one can now pull up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/futuresalon/">the full photoset of Future Salon pictures at Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>This is a usage pattern I would like to explore a bit more. I really like the idea of a common resource that everyone can contribute to and the concept of group action <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=351">I mentioned in the post about Mobile Media Metadata</a>. Tags present a great way to provide part of this benefit - I was able to add my photos to the pool of Future Salon images at Flickr because one of the organizational methods they have is slicing across user accounts based on tags. However one of the issues with the organizational style is that I had to figure out that tag using a very manual process. That&#8217;s just a part of the system, I accept that. Part of the advantage is that everyone has the flexibility to do anything they want, so part of the problem is the chaos that results from everyone doing anything they want. Are there some &#8220;social norms&#8221; kind of activities that we can introduce to enhance the benefit for some use cases without having to constrict the architecture? Here are a couple of ideas that I was playing with.</p>

<p>The first is using date tags. For example I tagged <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=401">my post</a> about <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/geek_wine_gathe.html">the event that Niall has proposed</a> with <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/20050131">the date on which the event is going to occur</a>. Tags like that could help organize a community calendar (I was just talking to <a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">Rayg</a> about calendar feeds the other day) as well as give people a hand when it comes to figuring out what to tag their own content. I&#8217;m not sure it would really work out, the system might collapse under the sheer weight of the postings. An important abstraction that makes this easier for the user is a &#8220;related&#8221; tags view. If you take a look at those <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/futuresalon/">Future Salon images</a> you&#8217;ll see over on the left hand side that the tag <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/paloalto/">paloalto</a> is related. Another great mechanism would be multiple tag lookup for these systems. I want to find things tagged as 20050131 and event and sanfrancisco. But now we&#8217;re talking details and not big picture, so I&#8217;m just gonna move right along.</p>

<p>Closely related to the date tags for events are geography tags for exactly the same reason.  I want to find other information about people who were at the same events that I was. However, I can tag something as sanfrancisco - but someone else at the same event might tag their content as macworld and a third person might tag Moscone. Just about all the solutions for this get very messy very quickly. We can define hierarchies of tags for locations or tag with inexact GPS coordinates. But ultimately we want to be able to set a tag for the exact position, or close to it, and search within a given area. Not possible with the current tagging systems, but possibly not that far out of line for near term evolution. A location lookup  could be used along with dates to find event postings quite well. Weird huh? That del.icio.us was created by the same guy who did geoURL? Maybe not all that weird.</p>

<p>The spam problem. There will be one, it&#8217;s happening already I&#8217;m sure. People will tag their content so that it shows up in inappropriate places. You&#8217;ll do a tag search for fluffybunnies and you&#8217;ll be greeted with a set of ads for Viagra and home refinancing. Tags add spam right back into the mix. Their ability to pull together content across user and site boundaries is their strength, and it opens them to exploit. So I was thinking about the union of social networking and tagging. For instance the ability to lookup tags from friends only. Or friends of friends of course. I was thinking about that particular union before the event. But because we were sitting in a digital identity event talking about Identity Commons, I started thinking about a <a href="http://2idi.com/">2idi</a> style system holding <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a> or <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> or <a href="http://www.opml.org/">OPML</a> info. Of course just about any news site could be greatly improved with access to OPML info. But anything that provides general tagging could potentially benefit by weighting tags from trusted sources higher than untrusted sources. This doesn&#8217;t exclude tags from sources that aren&#8217;t known - we still have the chance encounters with new info, but hopefully can filter out most of the noise from external interruptions if we&#8217;re looking for info that&#8217;s well represented within our own network. I saw some use to the identity systems before, but this example helped shed some new light. Now that I grok a few new possible forms of the system I realize that Marc has <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/12/politics_versus.html">probably had these shapes burning in his mind for quite some time</a>.</p>

<p>So where does this leave us? I think what we&#8217;re seeing is that metadata that used to be mixed into the documents as additional schemas can be broken up and added as tags. Currently we have the <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/index.jsp">Creative Commons search engine</a> for one kind of metadata, <a href="http://rubhub.com/main/">rubhub</a> for XFN searches, and geoURL used to be able to provide geographical lookups. But lets say we broke down each of those vocabularies into individual attributes and provided a relatively uniform way to represent them. Say by adding something like the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/18/TechnoTags">&#8220;scheme&#8221; field that Tim Bray mentions</a>. Now each tag has the potential to represent something almost like an RDF tuple should the user want to make use of it that way. With just a few of these schemes in use the search engine could answer a query like &#8220;give me all photos taken by my friends within 200 yards of Moscone between 1pm and 2pm yesterday&#8221;. Things could really start looking up for the <a href="http://www.tantek.com/presentations/2004etech/realworldsemanticspres.html">lower case semantic web</a>. That would be pretty sexy.</p>

AttentionXML is a new technology initiative that will present a richer view than that available through just a static list of rss feeds.  This new standard, still under discussion and development, will help you manage your blogroll, turning it from a list into an interactive, filtered stream of content.</p></blockquote>

<p>The event is a ways outside of my normal stomping ground, but well worth the trip.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/february-7th-2005-meeting.html">posted info about the February 7th 2005 MobileMonday meeting</a>. We have a stunning lineup of speakers this time around, I&#8217;m really excited about this.</p>

<p>We had a Mobile Hackers meeting a few days ago, but nothing really came of it. Russ asked everyone to bring some running code, but that didn&#8217;t work out so well. Some people didn&#8217;t have anything at all, some had demo apps but no code, and the hacking never really got underway. As I mentioned before I&#8217;ve started playing around with <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=392">Python on the Series 60</a>, and would like to see if I can get some tools cobbled together that scratch some of my own itches. So if you&#8217;re interested in hacking on some Python stuff snag me at the meeting and we&#8217;ll talk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/momo-tech-gathering.html">the mobile geekout tonight</a> I finally got around to installing and mucking around with <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,034-821,00.html">Python for the Series 60</a>. I haven&#8217;t had time to really explore the boundaries yet, but what I have played with has been fantastic. Check out the <a href="http://www.postneo.com/postwiki/moin.cgi/PythonForSeries60">Python for Series 60 wiki page</a> for more info. I took the Bluetooth GPS example there to fool around with. I put up <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/series60_python/bluetooth_samples_1.txt">a version of the code with indentation preserved</a>.  I&#8217;ll post more about it as I play around some. Like some info about the remote console over Bluetooth. In my estimation this beats their halfassed C++ environment and simulator. That simulator just keeps pissing me off. Every time I think I have it working something else goes wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As is probably abundantly obvious from the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">front page at Feedster</a>.  We originally expected that the downtime would be Friday afternoon, but there were some snags (I would point you to Scott Johnson&#8217;s post, but apparently it&#8217;s on the servers that are currently down, d&#8217;oh!). So this is a planned upgrade, not some crash or hack we have to deal with. The rapid growth in the number of new feeds appearing on the Internet, and the effort that <a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">Ray</a> has made to get all of them to parse and to get more of them added to the index faster, ended up overwhelming the servers. When the site comes back up hopefully it&#8217;ll be snappier and more robust, thanks in no small part to <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/?guid=20041221192907">the work that Nick Heyman has done since recently joining</a> (Nick, you need a blog so that I have something to point to when I talk about you).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran into <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">Tantek</a> last night at <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008256.html">Russ&#8217;s birthday party</a>, and talking with him reminded me that I never updated my blog to include <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN info</a>. <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> includes a nice simple XFN generator for the links section, so I decided to use that. I had originally populated the links with an import of the OPML from Bloglines, so adding the relationship info was a snap. Then I started thinking about keeping the info up to date, and synced in the different places it needs to live. Since Wordpress manages the XFN info for me, and publishes it, I figured using Wordpress as the authoritative source would be a good idea.</p>

<p>The two major places that I want my info are here on my blog and in <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, the web based aggregator I use. I figured it would be pretty easy to get Bloglines to sync with Wordpress in a repeatable manner, but not quite. First I figured I would just be able to look at some URLs and create a bookmarklet in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">FireFox</a> to import the OPML into bloglines based on the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/wp-links-opml.php">OPML export</a> that Wordpress does. But it turns out that Bloglines wants the OPML uploaded as a file. Not a big deal, but I&#8217;m surprised they don&#8217;t take a URL for that import field. After fooling around a bit to make sure that multiple import will work the way I expect I ran into two issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bloglines treats the first category it hits as the base folder, so one category of feeds was getting dumped into the root instead of their own location. I just created a dummy category in Wordpress to appear as the first category in the OPML and I ignore it.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time I import the folders get duplicated. The new copy is empty, so they&#8217;re easy to delete out, and it doesn&#8217;t mess with the status of the feeds or anything. But it&#8217;s annoying. This was a real pain, I want my links to just sync between the services.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So I have a simple, <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/wp-to-bloglines.txt">effectively three line perl script</a> that I should be able to just throw in cron to sync my feeds, but instead I have to run it by hand. The goal would be a bookmarklet that adds the current page into my Wordpress links so that I can add XFN info, and somewhere in the background have something sync the feed for my new friend over to Bloglines. I don&#8217;t know if that reimport problem with Bloglines is a well known issue or not, but I submitted a note to see what they say. If that was working well it would be a cool feature to add syncing with Bloglines directly into Wordpress. I could just parse the Javascript to figure out the structure of the folders and delete out the dupes, but that just smacks of effort.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to <a href="http://www.vlab.org/204.cfm?eventID=49">a presentation at Stanford VLAB titled &#8220;Bringing Great Open Source Ideas to Market&#8221;</a> earlier this week. There were some interesting comments made, and I&#8217;ll get some of those down here. First I want to mention the overall message however: &#8220;2005 will be the breakout year for open source&#8221;. Good message, the spirit is right, but I don&#8217;t agree. I&#8217;m not at all an expert in terms of business predictions and industry tracking, but I have been writing open source since 1992 so I am familiar with parts of it. In particular I am familiar with this part of it. And as someone working within that community I can assure you that every year since about 1996 has been predicted as &#8220;the breakout year for open source&#8221;. The predictions are always made by people already working on or with open source, and every year something generally described as &#8220;business concerns&#8221; keeps it from happening. So although I&#8217;m always happy to hear it, I&#8217;m no longer moved by the prediction. What is happening, and what will continue to happen, is the accelerating adoption of open source. It might look something like a breakout to people within the particular industries that have picked up open source. However open source is already exploding on the market. Has exploded on the market even. It might seem like something new if you normally work with application servers and middleware, but go ask someone in embedded systems about Linux. It&#8217;s out there already. It&#8217;s just moving from lower levels like the kernel to higher levels like web service infrastructure (much as I&#8217;ve moved from embedded systems programming to working at <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a>, the parallel is not coincidental). What&#8217;s evolving is the business model to go along with it, which is exactly what Marc Fleury was talking about. So certainly kudos to him on that one.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to call out some of the points that I found most interesting. Mark at Indexed Forever <a href="http://indexedforever.com/index.php?p=32">has already posted</a> with some info also. For me the most salient point was the generations of open source business model. He put down three of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No business model - most projects</p></li>
<li><p>Packaging - like <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/suse/">SUSE</a> and <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Redhat</a></p></li>
<li><p>Professional - like <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>He drew the distinction between the packaging companies and the professional open source companies by saying that packaging companies act as an interface to the open source community while professional open source companies ARE the community. Professional open source companies employ all of the major contributers to a project. They can do that because they are the ones that drove the project through critical mass. They might be the original authors of the software, but not necessarily. They do have to be the current wardens for the most popular branch. Because they do have all the major contributors to the project, and deep knowledge about the system, they can provide the kind of support that extends beyond answering user questions and gets into transforming the package to deliver greater value. Which is important because you can&#8217;t charge for licenses (past value created) but for support and maintenance (future value that could be delivered). Nice point, it lies pretty well in line with what I&#8217;ve seen over time. It certainly explains the great success that MySQL has had, and why there is so much buzz over JBoss these days. I would offer something of a counterexample in <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/ximian.html">Ximian</a>. Although I know some people would call acquisition by Novell success, while others would say it was the reason for the project not diffusing as far as it could have. I&#8217;m not saying that invalidates the principle however, just another datapoint to keep in mind as the model evolves.</p>

<p>He made a few other points about scaling the project also. First of all, if you do have a project that has critical mass and you are positioned well, you&#8217;ll need to have a good way to filter leads. As an open source based company you&#8217;ll have a lot of users, and only a small subset of those will be customers. Traditional companies aren&#8217;t structured like this, and it can actually be a great asset to be sitting at the hub and facilitating all the discussions that go on about the project. But you have to have a much different salesforce because of that, not everyone understands the transition. You&#8217;ll need salespeople who can filter the huge amount of info and figure out which are leads to profitable customers. That&#8217;s much different than the salesperson who understands going out and hunting down a license sale. He also made a point about choosing metrics to measure your progress.  That can be number of downloads, cvs commits, number of support emails. The metric should be chosen based on what particular goal you have for the stage your at. Although I don&#8217;t think this is what Marc said directly, I took this as calling out the measurable marketing you have at your disposal when you&#8217;re running as an open source company. You can see how the community is growing, how your message is making it out there, how people are using the system and what they want done. The increased transparency of open source goes both ways. Not only do your customers have more insight into what you&#8217;re doing and how you do it, but you should be able to get more insight into what they need and how they&#8217;re looking at solving their problems. If you can take advantage of that it&#8217;s a very good thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I upgraded my <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> install today. I&#8217;ve been getting a ton of comment spam, and instead of hacking my aging install to deal with it I want to hack a new install. Wordpress has served me really well, and I love the features, so instead of being a punter and just downloading the latest release, I installed the version from CVS instead. Matt said <a href="http://photomatt.net/2005/01/12/no-spam/">there are all kinds of antispam things that seem to be working</a>, so I&#8217;ll give them a try. And hack if I have issues.</p>

<p>The main problem I have when upgrading is my non-standard template. I do a lot of mobile stuff, and standard site designs are always a pain when viewed from a mobile device. So I always end up stripping things down to a very simple layout that scales from phone to PDA to desktop sizes. Some people don&#8217;t like the lack of normal interface elements, but in general I think it&#8217;s what I want. I was going to leave the original template up so that there are two versions of the site, one for people that want to see the standard website elements and my minimalist layout. I discovered that Wordpress now uses templated themes, which did actually make it difficult to just store the original index.php as desktop.php and hack index.php into what I wanted. But I did hack up a <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/stark.tgz">theme called Stark</a> that approximates what I&#8217;m going for. There&#8217;s some user specific info embedded in there now, like links for my email address, Flickr, and Buzznet. So there it is, mas hacking will ensue I think.</p>
