  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell posts about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005647.html">Mobile Web Page Thoughts</a>, in particular bringing up the need to both create and consume from mobile devices. I think there are some great points in there, such as devices coming with bound server space. Personally, I woudn&#8217;t like my mobile devices to work this way, but that&#8217;s cause I&#8217;m a hacker. I would rather have everything work the way I want than have it work automatically. But I can certainly see the value of the device having default associated space for content. Services like this are very much what I would like to make as part of the <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">Open Palm Environment</a>. Like I mentioned a long time ago on a <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/openSource/palmos.html">completely different website</a>, the existing network sync for the Palm is pathetic. I would love to see a real network sync tool, something using open standards and a decent protocol framework. This is something that the <a href="http://www.pilot-link.org">pilot-link</a> and <a href="http://www.plkr.org">Plucker</a> developers seem to groove on quite a bit as well. Then either users could setup the server on their own space, or someone could make a business out of hosting it as a service. Either way, I really don&#8217;t care. This then becomes the framework for uploading web content from your Palm device. Maybe the content is meant to be accessed by you only, such as your address book or calendar by default. Or you could chose to present a front end so people could browse your content online, or even allow others to directly sync your calender to their palm as well. And there&#8217;s no reason to restrict this to palm apps either. If the servers were defined using web services this framework could provide sync between all your applications. Your laptop and home PC and work PC could all use a contacts app that syncs through the same service that your PDA uses. New applications could exchange backup data with flags telling what data the user wants public and what data should remain private. This is how I think Palm devices should start talking to the world, directly over the network to servers which can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>provide backup services</p></li>
<li><p>provide syncronization between multiple applications on multiple platforms</p></li>
<li><p>allow palm users to directly collaborate</p></li>
<li><p>publish information to the web at large, presenting standard HTML pages for viewing and editing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Makes sense to me at least.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not much into the ringtone market at all, but I got an email from TJ at <a href="http://tonethis.com">ToneThis</a> talking about the way that they&#8217;re approaching setting up a mobile service. The way ToneThis works a user can encode music from the MP3 library on their home PC and turn it into a ringtone. I know it doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal, but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s really the way that the system should work. What should be surprizing is that it&#8217;s hard to get a ringtone on a phone unless your service provider sells it to you. But for some reason this is mostly just unquestingly taken as &#8220;the way things work&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure that one of the reasons that it&#8217;s hard to get a quality ringtone onto your phone is because service providers want to charge for them. ToneThis is a way to break away from  service providers wanting to wring every cent out of their customers. Instead of having to choose from a library of ringtones you get exactly the music you want. This is from the <a href="http://www.tonethis.com/index.php?page=news">news section of the ToneThis site</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Pannu says &#8220;Sprint&#8217;s open architecture allows users to access services like ToneThis, even when no formal deal is in place. I expect other carriers beyond Sprint will open up their networks, much the way Internet service providers have become conduits for outside traffic. What has been a series of closed networks is becoming more and more open&#8230; &#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I certainly hope so. This is an excellent example of the kind of thing I hope will be possible if providers do open up their networks. The carriers might loose the additional revenue from the ringtone. But because users have more control, and the flexibility to use the network in the way they see fit (rather than the way their service provider wants them to) I think they&#8217;ll see a lot more raw thoughput. And more importantly perhaps, I think they&#8217;ll see a lot more users in general. Right now cellular providers in the US seem to be trying to reign in innovation so that they can make sure they&#8217;re optimally positioned in the value chain for any new service.</p>

<p>I really do hope that providers are starting to trend in the direction of more open networks, and that we&#8217;ll see more services like ToneThis. Most services view the user a passive consumer hopefully willing to swallow what the service providers dish out. I would be very happy to see more services which allow the user to genuinely interact with the network - producing, consuming, exchanging, gathering, and generally doing whatever they want. The current services remind me way too much of the television network, pumping out large volumes of poor content. I&#8217;m frequently reminded of the description of biomass in <a href="http://slashdot.org/books/99/10/18/1049244.shtml">Snow Crash</a>, where the media moguls are described like whales straining the sea for plankton, only the media moguls are straining viewers for money. I find this analogy unnervingly apt when I look at the way that service providers seem to envision their users.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to do some of that running around that I was talking about in the last post, so I figured I would write up a blog entry. When I finished it and tried to upload, I had issues getting a network connection using my Palm to connect to my t68. It&#8217;s happened before, and usually a reset of one device or the other solves it (which sucks by the way). Yet this time, no dice. I&#8217;m waiting for a train, so what the hell, I might as well fix it.</p>

<p>The fix ended up being creating a new network connection on the Palm. Now, that just really sucks. There are lots of people out there who would love to have a wireless device. But with the constant quirks and bugs and incompatabilities, they just don&#8217;t feel they have an option.</p>

<p>I know a lot of Palm developers and even people who work at Palm who don&#8217;t see the need for a network connection from their PDA. If even the people at Palm don&#8217;t see it being practical, of course users aren&#8217;t interested. Palm has grudgingly developed their network functions, and it almost seems like they&#8217;re setting themselves up for failure. It&#8217;s like someone who wants to prove that network devices are a bad idea is running the show.</p>

<p>The only really bright spot in terms of networking is the purchase of Handspring. Hopefully they can imbue the Palm crew with at least a little bit of networked device smarts. On the other hand, all their good ideas could start getting squashed, and the Treo 600 might be the last good device we ever see from the combined companies. I certainly hope that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been quite busy lately, with things that unfortunately have me running around out in The Big Room rather than working in front of my computer. My hope is that this part of the work will only last until next week some time. And there&#8217;s a specific event in there which should keep things from bogging down. Fortunately I have my trusty PDA and a copy of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>, so I can at least provide some updates.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s update is about a package called c-jdbc (sorry, I don&#8217;t have the link onhand, just Google it for now and I&#8217;ll edit the post later to add it)(Update: here&#8217;s the <a href="http://c-jdbc.objectweb.org/">project page</a>). We&#8217;re just about to start testing it, so I&#8217;m not sure how well it works yet. It provides a JDBC layer that spreads requests over a number of databases. They refer to it as RAID for databases, which I think is both succinct and accurate. We&#8217;re going to try it instead of a proprietary clustering option. Anyone else tried it and care to share? Leave a comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100314">an article at The Feature</a> describing a style of handset that allows for interchangable faceplates that modify not just the look of the phone, but include memory as well. I&#8217;m interested in the announcement not really for the handset itself, or the youth audience targeting, but because it&#8217;s a multiple component architecture. What they plan to store in the skins are ringtones, images, and video clips; I would be more interested in faceplaces that provided additional functions (bluetooth, more ram, 802.11, applications, etc). In general the market doesn&#8217;t seem to like devices like this, highly configurable devices where the base system is just a framework that features can be added to. But I think that&#8217;s because many devices meant to allow flexable configuration have fallen far short of that goal. I would like to see personal information devices with a higher degree of hardware configurability. Even devices like the Zodiac, with it&#8217;s two expansion slots instead of one, I think are a major step in the right direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.osdl.org/newsroom/press_releases/2004/2004_01_12_beaverton.html">press release</a> at OSDL announcing the <a href="http://www.osdl.org/about_osdl/legal/lldf/lldf_description.html">Linux Legal Defense Fund</a>. It&#8217;s a fund meant to help those who SCO is threatening to sue. If you haven&#8217;t heard about the issue it almost definitely doesn&#8217;t affect you. In a nutshell, SCO owns the copyright to the original Unix codebase, and has decided to sue people using Linux cause SCO says there&#8217;s Unix code in Linux. This simply isn&#8217;t true. The few examples that SCO has given have proven to be written by Linus or to have derived from another source which existed before the Unix code SCO has rights to. The whole case is all just a big dramatic flailing which is sure to mark the final phase of the welcome death throes of a poorly managed and executed company. It&#8217;s like that last scene of a horror movie where the bad guy/monster is already mortally wounded, but out of spite it attempts to drag the hero/heroine down into death with them. But the good guy/gal grabs a kitchen knife and hacks off the arm of the disfigured villain. Well, you can think of the defense fund as the metaphorical equivalent of the kitchen knife. And hopefully that cheezy end-score will start soon and SCO will be nothing more than a bad memory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting off a new week almost always makes me depressed. I spend the weekend being able to at least fit in interesting bits of hacking here and there. Although this weekend was mostly work, and my site was down for a decent sized chunk of it, I did manage to fit in some palm-xmlrpc hackery. Not much, but at least I have something to point to. I managed to read some interesting stuff, including the <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html">&#8220;A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy&#8221;</a> article by Clay Shirky, which really got me thinking in some new directions again. I&#8217;ve been thinking about community quite a bit, as I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=90">mentioned here before</a>. In open source the code itself serves as the merit system. You don&#8217;t have to trust someone to be telling the truth, you just look at their code and find out. And I was trying to figure out where else there might be a mechanism that works that like, but wasn&#8217;t able to come up with an interesting one. Especially not within the context of forming a user community. But that isn&#8217;t what this post is really about&#8230;</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m back to the drudgery of normal life. I should probably be happy that I&#8217;ve got a contract to work on when so many people are out of work, but most of that is swallowed by having to rip myself away from somehting interesting in order to make some money. I would really like to pick up a few of the ideas I have for applications and to try to turn them into something. Even if most of what I do ends up getting open sourced, if I can just make enough to live off of (pay rent, bills, and buy food) I would be pretty happy if I can get the projects going. I think some of these applications need to be made before companies spot them and try to turn them into proprietary platforms. Wireless networking is still very much in its infancy, and it needs people to work on it without looking directly and immediately to the profit to be made from it. This is the way that the Internet was orignally formed and administered. Setup with a grant, and then grown by college students entranced with the new technology. Most of the wireless applications we see are driven by cellular providers looking to make the most from their pay-per-megabyte setups. The results are, well, just plain lame. And all of that makes me pretty sad overall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got a question the other day about using <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> to post to <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad.com</a> hosted blogs. I hadn&#8217;t tried it before, and it seems to work just fine. I put instructions up on the webpage, and I&#8217;ll probably be adding typepad.com as an option in the types list, cause I don t think most people would know what to set it to. At least a few of the MetaWeblogAPI methods might get support soon. If for no other reason than to be able to turn on title and category for MovableType sites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.osviews.com/print.php?sid=684">an article at osViews</a> about trying to get together a project to develop a full fledged user desktop package. By this they mean everything that a local computer retailer would need in order to sell full fledged Linux based systems, including artwork and sales and marketing materials. I think this is a great idea. Both in terms of getting together a standard system for use by mere mortals wanting to use Linux, and in pooling together resources by many individual retailers in order to get the project completed.</p>

<p>What concerns me however, is the structure of the proposed project. They&#8217;re talking about running this like a contest. The potential sellers of Linux based desktops would provide cash and other resources to be used as prizes for those wishing to submit entries into three different areas. I actually don&#8217;t think this is a good idea. The model that I personally think would be more likely to work is to have those interested in seeing a project like this done to directly create work to be distributed under something like <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">a Creative Commons deed</a>.</p>

<p>My reasoning for running this way is because it seems like the closer the contribution is to the user of the system, the more likely the open source model will work. Put another way, the more abstraction there is between user and producer, the worse off the project is. Therefor, have the users of the work directly contribute content they would like to see made part of the project. This doesn&#8217;t mean that they have to create the work directly themselves, they can always contract a designer to do the work, pay for it directly, and then put it under Creative Commons and publicly release it. It also ensures that those producing the work without being guaranteed return (the graphic designers, video editors, actors, and whoever else would have to be included) don&#8217;t end up wasting their time. If run like a contest, if a graphic designer makes an entry that doesn&#8217;t place at all, they end up getting no reward. Whereas a producer of a Linux Desktop does get a reward, the project produces a desktop system either way. Since the vendor gets benefit no matter what the outcome, it makes the most sense that they should directly bear the cost for the time contributed.</p>

<p>The other reason for making all the work available under license and then choosing from it is so that collaboration can happen. If run like a contest, the entrants will most likely want to keep their entries secret until the final judging. If they have a great idea, and their compensation depends on the impact of that great idea, they don&#8217;t want to give it away. If the work is made public by the vendor after the producer is already paid, they will want to make it available so that others can pick up and polish the idea. Take an example where one vendor has a great idea for a commercial, but doesn&#8217;t have the means to produce the video. They can either write the script themselves, pay a writer, or find a friend to do the script for them. If they license it under CC then someone who does have the means to produce the video, find sets, and locate actors can provide the second part of realizing that vision. Taking the contest out of the picture opens up the possible avenue of collaboration between vendors and volunteers. I think that would be absolutely essential, as it is for any other open source project. I ran this by <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/index.php">my girlfriend Eleanor</a>, who does business strategy consulting, and she said a project like this would almost definitely be able to get pro bono work from some established firms just so that they could say they were involved with the project.</p>

<p>Overall, I think it&#8217;s a GREAT idea. Kudos to whoever pinned this as a necessary step for the Linux movement. I think the time is finally ripe to start looking at options like this. But it&#8217;s one of those areas where the devil is really in the details. One small mistake in the execution of the project at the early stages could really derail the whole thing.</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, as we&#8217;ve said before, we&#8217;re still not quite sure why PDAs are considered a separate market category from smart phones - as a smart phone is really just a connected PDA. Just like a computer without a modem is still a computer, no one called computers &#8220;Smart Computers&#8221; when people finally started adding modems or NIC cards to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve had some trouble with people making the PDA/SmartPhone distinction, it irked me but I was never quite sure why. That&#8217;s an excellent summary of the issue. Why does adding a cellular interface to a PDA turn it into another class of device? The commentary from Jupiter is interesting as well. I think their asessment is valid&#8230; IF network applications for mobile devices continue to disappoint. But I think the correct mix of services would quickly drive uptake of connected mobile devices. And unlike the mismanaged rollout of Bluetooth, I don&#8217;t think that handset makers are going to subsidize putting PDA functions into handsets in the hopes that they will be useful at some unspecified point in the future. Once a PDA is a useful and fully contained personal information device, I think those numbers will change. As long as the PDA is mostly a desktop peripheral with small classes of underdeveloped standalone applications, those numbers will remain low.</p>
