  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a link to <a href="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2281736">this article</a> in <a href="http://evhead.com/">Evan Williams blog</a>. It takes a look at the social, political, and scientific networking which was commonly done in coffeehouses, and compares that interaction with what currently happens through the Internet. I had heard plenty about the use of coffeehouses as seats of political revolution, but I hadn&#8217;t heard of their use in scientific circles till I read this. There is a lot of parallelism between the role that coffeehouses provided and the role that weblogs and websites serve today, but I think that online interaction serves a role much less important than it could. If we take a look at the strong communities that did grow around coffeehouses, and around some strong scientific networking figures like <a href="http://www.paulerdos.com/">Paul Erdos</a>, the effects of the Internet seem much more subdued. The Internet has done great in terms of facilitating exchange of information, and it certainly has allowed for the formation of community where there wasn&#8217;t the critical mass before. It has allowed for great advances, I just think it should be going further.</p>

<p>I think the issue could be that the standard coffee-house gathering style, when available, is just more appealing than online interaction. When online communities grow they don&#8217;t always connect with the real world equivalents. To use a recent example, the <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/">Weblogger Meetup</a> here in the Bay Area is quite poorly attended. I emailed a bunch of people and we had a decent turnout last month. But previous months it&#8217;s been quite dead. There are a lot of bloggers in the Bay Area, why are the meetups so poorly attended? I think one reason is that people in the area already have an outlet for their geekiness. Meetup offers people a way to use the internet to form real world social connections. But in the Bay Area people already have those social connections in place. They don&#8217;t need to go online to find a place to geek out over networking protocols and obscure copyright laws and regulations. At least some of their friends are already deep enough into those topics that they can get their fill during normal interaction.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s primarily in places where the real world network is thin that supplementing it with online gathering tools is really necessary. And I don&#8217;t mean that this only happens in places where there are few people overall. The geeky meetups in New York might be very well attended. But I think that boils down to the same reason. The social network surrounding high tech topics can be quite thin. Which is quite different than here in San Francisco, where you can hardly walk a block without hearing someone talking about how to schedule DNS zone transfers or arguing over the decision to use qmail. I think that people have such a fill of geek topics during the average day that they don&#8217;t seek out online community unless they&#8217;re really extreme cases. I think the same kind of thing probably happens in other areas with other concentrations as well (Hollywood and movies, Detroit and automobiles, Manhattan and finance, etc.) The Internet does a great job of creating communities, but they&#8217;re still restricted communities. The online versions don&#8217;t commonly attract interest from the real world nexus participants. This frequently leaves online communities as rather weak appendages when compared to the overall body of knowledge and social networks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100287">an article at TheFeature</a> describing the challenges in billing presented by cellular services trying to create personalized service packages. It sounds like a great solution that Portal Software has come up with, but I still think this is a step in the wrong direction. I just don&#8217;t want my cellular provider to have a hand in everything I do on the cellular network. The new billing system at least sounds like it could be flexable, so it shouldn&#8217;t cause too many issues too soon. But what happens when the cellular usage patterns start to defy the object model presented by the software? It could end up in new technologies not getting implemented because of the infrastructure implications.</p>

<p>It could be possible that the software allows for a completely fluid set of associations, but I&#8217;m betting that this also puts the cellular provider in charge of who can be a third party in the billing process. Something that&#8217;s already started with data services IMO (ever try to get a server component that can send MMS messages to any cell phone?) and is causing trouble in that space. This would just further extend the stranglehold that cellular providers have over their customers. If anyone has a pointer to some details about how the third party billing associations are setup and utilized within the Portal Software solution, please <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">drop me a line</a>.</p>

Excellent concrete examples to site for certain industries. There&#8217;s an obvious benefit for contractors, who can snap pictures of trouble spots and either get customer or third party feedback. Great example.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been poking around quite a bit lately looking for interesting events in and around Menlo Park (where I live), and I finally found <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/bale/">the Bay Area Linux Events</a> listing. It&#8217;s probably something I should have known about as soon as I moved into the area, but I&#8217;ve been living a sheltered life :-)  Rick&#8217;s <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Linux_PR/newlug.html">tips for new Linux Users Groups</a> is an interesting document as well. I&#8217;ve started talking to people over at <a href="http://www.sdforum.org">SDForum</a> about getting together an Open Source SIG, and some of the tips there look like they might really apply.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a few news items at weblogs.com, including <a href="http://newhome.weblogs.com/2003/12/15#a113">an announcement about moving the server to a new location</a>.  The service does seem to be a lot quicker, but that could just be subjective. There are also some other items about additional features and problems with some users who seem to be pulling the changes.xml file much more often than they should.  So if you&#8217;re using weblogs.com changes for some app, check to make sure you&#8217;re only pulling it infrequently. Once an hour seems to be the guideline.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9606.html">this page on the Inverted Pyramid writing style</a> before, but it was still interesting to read. It describes the atributes of good journalistic articles, which are written in a way that encourage the reader to stop whenever they get bored. Instead of writing a story that builds up piece by piece, a story is written with the main point right up front and varying levels of detail later on. It&#8217;s a good principle to keep in mind. I know that I normally set about writing pages more like writing essays from college. And that&#8217;s not the way that online content should be presented for most of what I do.</p>

The article serves as a great example of how the challenges of promoting wider open source adoption can be overcome. Plus I  think the cause itself is fantastic. Bob has apparently been working to get libraries in Scotland to include CDs containing open source software in their collections. With most of the people there still on dialup, downloading large packages like Mozilla or OpenOffice is difficult. He&#8217;s been trying to get copies of the software made available at the library. Excellent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was getting ready a couple of blog posts on the topic of rapid prototyping, but decided instead to put the information on <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/prototyping.html">a permanent page</a> on the Bitsplitter site. The information is apparently pretty randomly organized, but I still wanted to put it up. I think it&#8217;s a pretty good list of issues to keep in mind and goals to strive for.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on getting new technical products and services together for 10 years, but it&#8217;s only recently that I&#8217;ve become aware of some of the benefits of rapid prototyping that lie outside of that technical realm. Now that I&#8217;ve started reading a few books on the topic I realize that there are other people who have developed these ideas very fully. This is my attempt to call out some of the existing literature about rapid prototyping and tie it to the everyday concerns of anyone working on a completely new project or service. It can be very stressful and isolating at times. It&#8217;s a relief to see that others have observed the same issues and can provide some stirring insight. That page deals primarily with software and embedded systems projects, but I welcome <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">feedback</a> from just about any area. Let me know what you think, or tell me what major issues you&#8217;ve encountered. I would love to hear from all you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an excellent <a href="http://www.innovationtools.com/Articles/ArticleDetails.asp?a=113">article at Innovation Tools</a> about methods used to capture ideas when they come to you. I think that most of the Palm based tools for capturing ideas are pretty underdeveloped. A while ago I was considering writing a Palm app to do something like the mind map described in the article (although at the time I didn&#8217;t know it was called a mind map). Now that I&#8217;ve read the article, it sounds like it might make a good app for the pilot. Especially the Clie and OS5 devices with larger screens. I normally carry my PDA around with me to jot down little ideas. But when I don&#8217;t have it with me, I SMS a message to my email address (my provider has a SMS to email gateway).</p>
