  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went out to hear <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1676&amp;mo=5&amp;yr=2005">Paul Graham speak last night</a> and after that we <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/archives/2005/05/04/338">gathered together some geeks to meet for dinner in Palo Alto</a>. At first it was going to be a small group, we thought maybe 5 or 6 people. But by the time we actually sat down <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/12449886/in/photostream/">there were 15 people at the table</a>.  Il Fornaio worked out quite well for the gathering. The space they gave us was actually big enough for 15 people. I hate when you go somewhere with a big group and they give you a table that you can barely stand around shoulder to shoulder. They were open late. And it was pretty cheap.  The bill split evenly came out to $17 per person, which isn&#8217;t much considering that most people had wine and there were a lot of entrees served. Some people had just desert or a cocktail, but still that&#8217;s pretty cheap for a group outing.</p>

<p>The talk by Paul Graham was very good. I got there late, and Elle and Niall had called to tell me they saved me a seat in the first row. As I was walking in Paul was up front talking and reading from a sheaf of notes. I thought to myself &#8220;Uhoh, if he&#8217;s just reading off some prepared speech I might get pretty bored.&#8221; And given that I can&#8217;t get a cell phone signal from up at the PARC building where the presentation was held and there&#8217;s no wifi onsite that can be really distracting for the people around me. Wasn&#8217;t an issue at all however. He was just using the notes as guidelines and telling some really amusing stories about his direct experiences. That was what really made it engaging I think, that it was about specific experiences that Paul had himself. Many of the points are pretty obvious when you abstract them out of the talk, like you should be concentrating on growing your business if you&#8217;re looking to be aquired because the condition of growing value makes you more attractive to potential suitors, and the best way to get in front of those potential suitors is to go in proposing partnerships and licensing deals. But there were a ton of bits and peices of practical tactics scattered around the overall strategy stuff. No way I&#8217;ll be able to get them all, but here&#8217;s a bunch that stood out for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When talking about planning to get bought at some point he said that license deals can actually be a liability in some cases. The person who aquires you or your technology isn&#8217;t going to look favorably on being tied to a license deal that requires them to let their competition use the technology as well. There are contrary examples, like Google licensing search to Yahoo and Altavista to prevent those companies from working on search on their own. But it is something to keep in mind while you&#8217;re out there shopping around.</p></li>
<li><p>He really encouraged getting an investment bank involved if your deal is big enough that it makes sense to do so. Under the standard structure they use they&#8217;re properly incented to make the deal in a way that&#8217;s really favorable to you when it&#8217;s favorable to them. They make the process much easier.</p></li>
<li><p>He stressed that potential aquireors aren&#8217;t really all that likely to steal your idea and make their own copy. It does happen, and he gave an example of a Japanese firm that stole their business plan and technology and setup their own shopping site. But in general things like that don&#8217;t really happen. The best way to protect against it is to keep some key factors of what your innovation is out of your discussions. You can give away a whole bunch without giving away everything essential to reproduce the system. If you think that copying is a real risk just figure out a few nonobvious areas in which to hold back some info.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important metric for most people evaluating the company is the number of users. Most aren&#8217;t well prepared to evaluate the technology itself, but they can observe the effects of a good implementation. It&#8217;s assumed that if you have crappy technology you won&#8217;t have many users and that if you do you should. So the best thing to do is to grow your customer base to prove that the technology is good, it&#8217;s better than trying to figure out how to describe why your tech is great. You can prove it quite easily by pointing to the group of existing users, which is more valuable to other areas of the business than a description of the technology anyway.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been quite a bit of buzz about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008442.html">Adam Curry starting a podcasting show on Sirius</a>. Doc <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2005/05/03#takingTheFork">picks up the thread</a> and says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Second, what Adam will be doing at Sirius, and what Howard Stern will be doing as well, is restoring radio to what it used to be, and should have been, all along. But it&#8217;s not podcasting. It&#8217;s new life for an old sphere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not going to argue that what Adam is doing in this case is broadcasting and not podcasting, but I have a completely different takeaway. Sure podcasting is a fundamentally different system than broadcasting was, and needs to be treated as something different if it&#8217;s going to progress. But I don&#8217;t see what Adam is doing as leveraging the new medium of podcasting to prop up radio. I think the radio folks might see it that way, and that&#8217;s why they put him on the air. I think what Adam is doing is introducing people to podcasting through a medium they already consume. He&#8217;s raising awareness for the medium and giving people a way to sample from it without a technical investment.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s hard for some of us technical people to understand, but let me lead you on a very quick romp through the progress of podcasting. At first there were some quick people who really groked the whole concept and built it, nod to Dave and Adam, with some really fast followers picking up on the casts and what they meant right away. But even among the technical folks there was a bit of hesitance. Some of them said &#8220;yea, interesting, but do I really want to listen to some guys just talking?&#8221; and &#8220;I would really rather read my information&#8221; and &#8220;sounds like just a whole lot more crap, just in a different encoding now&#8221;. But a lot of those folks came to the other side pretty quickly. Podcasting attracted great content, and the tools got better, and the word of mouth network and blogosphere spread the information necessary to get the right content in the right hands. Lots of the people who were hesitant tried it out anyway, and once they actually tried it they found out that they liked it. The influx of new users drove a new set of users, and it snowballed very quickly. It seems like it spread all over because it&#8217;s hit all the geeks and the media and info junkies. It hasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sitting on Caltrain on my way into San Francisco, traveling from Palo Alto up north. You don&#8217;t really find a more technically savvy area than the one I&#8217;m in. There are 26 people in this train car with me. I just asked all of them if they listen to podcasts or not. 5 of them said yes they did, 2 said that they know what they are but don&#8217;t really listen to any casts, and the rest all said something along the lines of &#8220;what&#8217;s podcasting?&#8221;. Now granted, for a new movement, to have 7 out of 26 random people aware of the medium is great. Kudos on the job done so far. But you know what, when I asked those people if they listen to radio, not a single one said &#8220;what&#8217;s radio?&#8221; People know what radio is, they know how to get it if there&#8217;s something there they&#8217;re interested in, and a lot already have the skills necessary and the vocabulary to understand it. That isn&#8217;t true for podcasting. Not yet at least. And if we are to make it so we need to engage in that most horrid of technical efforts, customer education. The word has spread like wildfire through the technical community because we have a distribution network for information that we actively go out and crawl, we seek out the info and try out new things. If podcasting is going to cross the proverbial chasm, there needs to be a way to get the folks on the other side aware of what the benefits are and how to get there. This isn&#8217;t my idea by the way, <a href="http://www.ericrice.com">Eric Rice</a> rants about this all the time. And he couldn&#8217;t possibly be more right. Podcasting is a cultural and social revolution, not a technical one. So technical hacks and tools aren&#8217;t really going to carry the medium to the capacity at which it becomes transformative on a global scale. It&#8217;s going to take cultural and social hacks instead. If you want podcasting to change the world, get out there and teach someone nontechnical how to get podcasts, teach someone without a technical background but with a great message how to create podcasts. I really think that&#8217;s the next step, and I think Adam is right on the mark with what he&#8217;s doing.</p>

<p>And just in case this should be misconstrued as hero worship, I actually don&#8217;t listen to the podcasts that Adam does. He&#8217;s just not my kind of audio. Not a problem, I&#8217;m sure if I were to do a podcast he wouldn&#8217;t really be interested in me either. So I&#8217;m speaking from the detached viewpoint of someone interested in podcasting and aware of what Adam has done from the technical side. I just really think this is the right move. And a radio person who groks the new medium is a perfect way to introduce the new to the existing listeners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>JD posted about <a href="http://www.darknet.com/2005/04/grassroots_medi.html">a grassroots media social gathering</a> on Friday May 13th at CNet in San Francisco. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/03/citizens_media_.html">invitation only citizens media strategy session</a> on the Saturday after, and a bunch of the folks attending that session are going to be at the gathering the night before. It&#8217;s going to be a pretty crazy week for me, but I&#8217;m going to try to make it out for Friday. What is citizens/grassroots media? Check out some of the articles from <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;limit=15&amp;q=%22citizen+media%22+OR+%22grassroots+media%22&amp;sort=date">this search</a>. It&#8217;s an evolving concept, so it&#8217;s hard to give a simple static definition. When I think of grassroots media I think of <a href="http://www.jluster.org/">Jonas Luster</a>, <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/">Dan Gillmor</a>, and <a href="http://jd.typepad.com/">JD Lasica</a>. And they do have different takes on what the whole movement means. So drop by on that Friday and find out what all the hubub is about straight from the source, there&#8217;s sure to be some interesting discussion and arguments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/04/30#a521">conversation going on about advertising in RSS</a>. Dave Winer doesn&#8217;t think that advertising belongs in RSS at all, and apparently there are a bunch of people who feel the same way. That certainly makes some sense, I felt the same way about the Internet as a whole opening up to commercial influence when I was back in college. I figured that once commercial influences showed up online the value of the information available would go down. There would be so much advertising and selling that none of the useful information would be findable. It was possible I guess, but relatively myopic. Not that mediums can&#8217;t be ruined by transformations of content or audience. I think Usenet is effectively a ruined medium, unable to bear the influx of a large number of belligerent and uninformed participants. But I don&#8217;t think the web was ruined by the introduction of commercial concerns, and advertising in particular. The web actually got a whole lot more interesting after businesses showed up. I spent a bunch of time thinking about why that is, cause I felt like an idiot after spouting off again and again about &#8220;the death of the web&#8221; that would occur if businesses were allowed to influence the future direction of the Internet.</p>

<p>So why not? Why wasn&#8217;t the web completely overtaken with advertising? Because advertising only works if people see it. If you&#8217;ve got a website that does no one any good, and no one is interested in going there in the first place, you don&#8217;t make any money off your advertising. That&#8217;s not necessarily true everywhere in advertising. In the offline world advertisers can buy billboard spots along highways and know that people will see their message. Cars follow particular paths, and people can get properties that expose drivers and passengers to their message even if they add no value because they know people are forced to go along roads when they drive. In part it was expected that the online advertising world would be somewhat the same. People would buy advertising at the roadside to the online world, which at one point people figured meant buying advertising at search engines and portals. That wasn&#8217;t really the best model of how things worked out however. It turned out that buying ads online was a lot more like buying ads in a magazine than buying outdoor advertising. That&#8217;s really important for a number of reasons. First of all, the value of the advertising space moves a lot closer to the point of value creation. If someone creates a site that lots of people love and visit every day, that person sells advertising on it and can directly profit. That incents some people to create useful sites who wouldn&#8217;t necessarily do so, which means more good stuff out there than if there were no advertising. Ooops! I blew that one, didn&#8217;t see it coming at all. That&#8217;s what I get for spending the last 20 years working on computer science and engineering instead of business and market theory. And unlike billboard space, you can&#8217;t just build more  to blast out your message. You have to create a site with draw in order to be able to create the advertising space to monetize. The portals and search engines still were able to sell advertising space, but it wasn&#8217;t because they were necessary stopping points, it&#8217;s because they had to add value in terms of the services they provided. As Google proved to the rest of the search community, searchers are not a captive audience. They are a set of customers who you have the privilege of trying to monetize if you provide them a valuable enough service to keep their attention. The same holds true with any property online. If I post information about what I had for breakfast along with a few dozen ads for mesothelioma I don&#8217;t necessarily make money from it. Unless the advertising matches the property and the property provides value to visitors the system just doesn&#8217;t work out in favor of the publisher, so it&#8217;s simply not worth doing. People might be out there putting up sites like that, but I don&#8217;t really care cause I don&#8217;t have to visit them.</p>

<p>The same holds true for RSS. If people want to put ads in the feeds and they&#8217;re annoying enough that I don&#8217;t feel like seeing them I unsubscribe. But <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> can have a shitload of advertisements in their feed before I unsub. <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russ</a> can feel free to toss just about any amount of advertising in his feed and know I&#8217;m not going to drop him from my high priority reading list. If a publisher has created a feed with a lot of value why shouldn&#8217;t they be able to directly monetize that feed? They might be able to create a feed with snippets and put advertising back on the main site. But that&#8217;s only one potential model for how to use RSS as a new publishing medium. And speaking as a technologist, I&#8217;m almost completely definite that the decision about how to use the medium should not be made by people like me. I&#8217;m sure that policy decisions about the content that&#8217;s acceptable in RSS should not be enforced by the tools. What made the Internet successful was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end to end principle</a>. The technologists came up with a system that made just about anything possible and then stood back and let the users of that system figure out how to create value with it. I think the same thing is true with RSS. As techies working in the field it&#8217;s our responsibility to make just about anything possible. There&#8217;s exactly one person who should decide what goes into the feed - the publisher of the feed. There&#8217;s exactly one person who should decide if a feed should be subscribed to - and that&#8217;s the reader of the feed.</p>

<p>I think the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002708.php">questions from Richard MacManus</a> are right on target. Of course I think that advertising in feeds is a valid technique, I wouldn&#8217;t be working on the FeedsterMedia stuff unless I thought it was something that would be of value to at least some people. I also don&#8217;t really see RSS becoming &#8220;polluted by advertising&#8221;. I learned from my mistake with my misassessment of advertising on the Internet at large. Sure, some people will toss advertising in low value feeds and I&#8217;ll be forced to unsub. But it&#8217;ll also mean that some people who don&#8217;t have feeds now will start producing them. It&#8217;ll mean that some people will start producing &#8220;feed properties&#8221; because there&#8217;s space for properties that didn&#8217;t have the proper draw as websites but do work as feeds. There will always be a continuum of feeds also. Some will have no advertising at all but provide extremely valuable info. Like, oh, say <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">my blog</a>. Absolutely fricking brilliant stuff, and not an advertisement in sight. See, sometimes there is a free lunch actually. Why do I continue to write a blog for free? Because I value the connections I make through publishing here. But just because I&#8217;ve decided to put my info out there for free, that DOES NOT mean that everyone else has to follow the same model that I did. It&#8217;s just arrogant and narrow minded to think so. Probably even more arrogant than calling your own writing &#8220;absolutely fricking brilliant stuff&#8221;. Some people will produce excerpt feeds with advertisements on the main site, others will produce full text feeds and want to put advertisements in them. Depending on the situation all kinds of different combinations make sense.</p>

<p>Most people believe that the best way to manage a market is to not manage it at all. Just let the people with the products decide how much they want to sell them for and the people with the money decide what they want to buy. Same thing applies here. Let the publishers decide what they want to publish and how they want to publish it, let the readers decide what they want to read. Everything else will work itself out. And like in a free market, the most value is created when there&#8217;s the least friction in the marketplace. The more tools publishers have at their disposal, the more they can experiment with models and find the ideal mix, the quicker we&#8217;ll find that maximum value point. And that&#8217;s not maximum value for just the publishers, it&#8217;s value for the medium as a whole. The two go hand in hand. Maybe Dave is right, and the real way to deal with the issue is to think creatively about how to make money with feeds. I say let the market decide that. If readers really don&#8217;t like ads in RSS, and there is a way to provide value and make money without doing ads, someone will set it up and the readers will flock there. Hell, I&#8217;ll be happy to post about it myself. Trying to prevent publishers from doing what they want and making decisions on the behalf of readers is just preventing progress however.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russ and I are most likely going to heading out to the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.net/mm/summit2005/index.php">Mobile Monday Global Summit</a>.  Some of the folks from the old skool original Helsinki Mobile Monday have been looking to get together people involved in the other Mobile Monday gatherings and try to get some collaboration going. It&#8217;s exactly my scene.  About 5400 miles away from my normal stomping ground, but the ideas are completely in line. The Mobile Monday gathering is part of the <a href="http://www.tieturi.fi/koulutus/seminaarit/mobileenterprise/home.asp">Mobile Enterprise 2005</a> event.  And the events are open and free to all! It looks like it&#8217;s going to be a big event with great speakers and they&#8217;re putting it on for free. That&#8217;s really impressive. I&#8217;m hoping to be able to do the same thing when we put on our event here in the Bay Area. Besides <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/">BloggerCon</a> I don&#8217;t know of large events that have managed to be free to participants. It might be hard, but I think it&#8217;s possible.</p>

<p>Russ and I  are planning to make it out there on the 8th so we have a bit of time to recover from the flight and be alive and kicking come the morning of the 9th. We were thinking about getting some of the other folks who are in from out of town together on the night of the 8th. We&#8217;ve been talking to Jari Tammisto from MobileMonday.net to do the planning. So if you&#8217;re going to be in town and interested in meeting up the night before the event starts, either snag Jari and find out what&#8217;s planned or email me (miker at bitsplitter dot net) and I&#8217;ll send the info out about where to meet up when I get it. We&#8217;re probably staying right in the area, so it&#8217;s most likely going to be right in that area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s some info about FeedsterMedia, from me, the person who put it together. Cause everyone thinks that they hacked out some kinda super secret info when they realize that directory listings are allowed.  That&#8217;s just sad folks. Buffer overflows in protocol handlers, escaping past URL filters, even good old SQL injection. These things might be hacking.. maybe. But directory listings, please. There&#8217;s another reason that directory listings might be allowed: I want people to know what&#8217;s out there. What a freakin&#8217; newsflash, stop the presses! Yep, that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not a secret that we were planning to do Slashdot and Sourceforge and Freshmeat feeds.  Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have time to blog about it before we did it. My bad on that one.</p>

<p>Why would I want people to know what&#8217;s out there? Cause some of the people out there are really smart and interested in what&#8217;s going on. If they can take a look at all the feeds we&#8217;re exporting they can provide feedback about stuff I might have messed up, or points where I could do things better. Openness can actually be a virtue at times (in my experience just about all the times when it really matters, but that&#8217;s just me). So there they are, right <a href="http://www.feedstermedia.com/feedcache/">there</a>, all the feeds that I&#8217;ve exported for outside use. Feel free to poke around, especially if you&#8217;re planning to give some feedback. Say you&#8217;re subscribed to some Freshmeat feeds and using <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/BottomFeeder/">BottomFeeder</a> to do your reading and you find some issues. Why would I want to prevent you from poking around in the other versions of the feeds if you&#8217;re so inclined? Perhaps at some point I&#8217;ll have to close the listings off if information about what feeds we&#8217;re publishing becomes an issue for the business side. But I hope that&#8217;s a long ways off, cause there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do in helping people make money using their RSS feeds. And the less information that gets hidden away the quicker everyone can learn.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m actually hoping that we can push out a whole boatload of information about this. We&#8217;ve run into some interesting problems. Sometimes they were just simple bugs that needed to be worked through. For instance if you&#8217;re a Mac user and have NetNewsWire try opening up a new tab and typing http://www.doubleclick.com into the location box. If you&#8217;ve got a 2.0 version b41 or before nothing comes up. Simple bug, but the kind of thing you run into when you&#8217;re trying something new. There are other issues, like how do you splice additional content into a source feed without forcing extraneous updates, that are tied up in the heads of people who have been working with RSS for a while and come up with rules of thumb. It&#8217;s a symptom of an immature market, there is no commodity level of functionality for something like &#8220;handling syndication feeds&#8221;. Which is unfortunate because I think that simple public discourse about issues like this could be something that helps out the RSS market (publishers, users, advertisers, service providers, etc) as a whole. There are issues like <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/?p=90">the feed rights issue that Steve Gillmor brought up</a> that can either be solved in private or solved in the commons. If it&#8217;s solved in private maybe someone gets to make a business out of it, if it&#8217;s solved in the commons it enables a whole set of new businesses. Me personally, I think the real value in RSS lies well outside of the technologies that move content from one place to another. The value comes more from the side that talks about discussions and user control and remixing, allowing publishers to form news kinds of relationships with their audiences, allowing businesses to find new ways to communicate with their customers and prospects. I would love to power through the mundane technical issues so that we can get on to that interesting stuff.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want info about FeedsterMedia just fill out the <a href="http://feedster.com/feedstermedia.php">form on the FeedsterMedia</a> page. Tell us what you want. I&#8217;ll try not to fall behind again and to keep the blog updates coming in advance of doing things so we don&#8217;t end up with some kinda faux cloak and dagger thing going on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/04/may-2005-mobile-monday.html">info for the May Mobile Monday</a> is up on the blog.  The topic is going to be identity, which is one of those hot topics that no one outside of the field can easily define. Thanks to John Kern we have an <a href="http://kerncomputing.blogspot.com/2005/04/discussing-digital-identity-at-mobile_26.html">excellent set of resources to start out with</a>. For those with an audio bent, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/digitalidentity.html">series of talks and interviews up on ITConversations as well</a>. I harp on the whole &#8220;mobile services and internet services need to be able to interact seemlessly&#8221; issue quite a bit, and I think this is one area where it&#8217;ll really stand out. For an increasing number of people out there, their mobile is their primary access device. Most services (in the US at least) are still stuck in the mode of the PC being the primary driver of the interface and the mobile being a tiny window into information configured elsewhere. We were able to look past a number of &#8220;inconveniences&#8221; when the interface was driven on a PC with a relatively high bandwidth user-to-device interface. Those same inconveniences are killers on handsets. Federated services on mobile devices are going to require something better than the current default if they&#8217;re to expand to serve audiences outside of niche markets, and identity is one of the key enablers. And federated services are what we really need. I know <em>I</em> don&#8217;t want a <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101009">walled garden</a> on my handset. Vive la resistance!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The discussion this morning at the <a href="http://www.ellementk.com/archives/2005/04/15/326">PMM in an Always-On World</a> wandered over some interesting topics. A few of the people there were from the promotional products area, and they were talking in particular about trade shows for a while. Apparently there&#8217;s been a lot of buzz in that industry over one organization trying to buy out the other, and when unsuccessful then attempting to launch a competing trade show at right about the same time. So there was some general discussion about trade shows and how they fit into the overall scheme of marketing and communications. One idea that we talked about, and the one I think I agree with the most, is that trade shows are one of the few places where you can get into a conversation with a company. It might certainly be true that the people with real purchasing decision power aren&#8217;t at the shows, but it&#8217;s a chance for your customers (and potential partners, and press, and resellers or licensees, etc.) to come and talk to your people. And it&#8217;s also a chance for your people to gather information from the people out walking around on the floor. I don&#8217;t see them as a chance really to meet all that many new leads, but to maintain relationships, exchange information, and discuss.</p>

<p>This is starting to change I think. Like <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/kandsranch">Steve Blank recommends for new products and companies</a>, companies are starting to dissolve the barriers between their employees and their customers. The blogging phenomenon provides a medium that&#8217;s particularly well suited to the out in the open iterative model of engaging with customers for the purpose of refining a product or service. If dialog across the organizational boundary is going on online already, that certainly changes the role that the trade shows will have. We also talked about blogs replacing the more traditional means of marketing, which is something that I don&#8217;t think will happen any time soon. Being engaged in blogging as an organization means that the roles of those traditionial activities are changed, they start to serve a different purpose. Press releases probably start to mean something completely different after a company starts blogging than they did before. Is the press release an invitation to start a discussion online or something issued after the discussion has been going on and a solid message has formed? That&#8217;s hard to say, and might be different for different organizational styles and methods of interacting with the public. There was someone there who does HR and asked if screening for people who would make good bloggers might be something that employers would want to consider. I think that&#8217;s definitely true. We&#8217;ve seen plenty of job shifts because of blogs, either people getting fired (Joyce Park was fired allegedly for content on <a href="http://troutgirl.com/blog/">her blog</a> about her former employer Friendster) or people getting hired (Russell Beattie was hired by <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> at least in part because of his <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">blog about mobility</a>, generally considered a must-read by people in the industry). And I do think that employers will be increasingly interested in the voice that their employees can hold out online for them. I don&#8217;t see this is a major change however, just a bit of a refocusing of attention into a new channel.</p>

<p>So how can a company go about getting involved in blogging? I generally don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to have someone outside your company blog for you. It might be a workable situation in some cases, but the real benefits to having a blog are discussion across the organizational boundary. If that discussion happens with someone outside and gets translated into your group by someone else you lose some of the benefits. Also, keep the discussion honest and open. There are going to be people who show up pissed off and acting nasty. For the most part everyone understands that those people exist, and it&#8217;s not their presence that you&#8217;ll be judged by, but your dealings with them that will be key. People pointed out that it takes a lot of time to consume and emit blog info. That&#8217;s definitely true, but even if you aren&#8217;t participating in these conversations they&#8217;re going to be going on. Even if you aren&#8217;t reading the information being written about you in blogs, people who use and buy your products probably are. And increasingly, journalists and analysts who cover your sector are almost definitely reading that information. Do you need to stop everything from your traditional marketing plan and just get everyone reading and writing blogs? No, although I suspect there are worse things that could be done. But it is something to be factored into the overall plan. The information you get out of interaction on blogs will most likely help you shape the rest of your campaigns. Possibly even helping you trim them down while making them more effective. This is one of those things that with a bit of investment, if you pay attention to the results, should have no problem paying for itself in terms of cost savings down the line.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to include a specific disclaimer in this one, cause it is so highly Feedster related. My opinions in this article have nothing to do with the official position of Feedster. Everyone there might agree, they might disagree. If they have something in particular to say I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be something on our <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/">corporate blog</a> or <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/">Rafer&#8217;s blog</a> or <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/">Johnson&#8217;s blog</a>. See how that works? Multiple people, with opinions, and an official corporate voice for the whole so that people can speak their mind on their own. It&#8217;s a good thing, believe me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall</a>, <a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a>, and I went to the <a href="http://www.nccbf.org">Cherry Blossom Festival</a> in Japantown in San Francisco yesterday. I have some images to upload, but I&#8217;ll have to do it later. We made it there in time to catch the Taiko drummers, and they were letting people up on stage to try out the drums. They had a few displays with info set out, but the only one we really spent time at was the display of weapons. I don&#8217;t have any pictures of that, there were signs all over saying not to take pictures. Of course, this being a public street I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything they could have done. But I didn&#8217;t want the pictures enough to be willing to piss off the guy with swords. The food was good too, although I suspect the fact that the firemens &#8220;blazing hot&#8221; ribs not actually being spicy at all caused a bit of disappointment. They were good, just not spicy. And I don&#8217;t mean that in the sense of &#8220;I&#8217;m a manly man! I can feel my tongue! These are NOT spicy!&#8221; I&#8217;m a wuss, I can&#8217;t deal with spicy food. The ribs just were not imbued with spice in the least. Perhaps some communications misfire.</p>

<p>After the obligitory spin through the vendors we decided to head over to <a href="http://www.bluebottlecoffee.net/">Bluebottle Coffee</a> on Linden street at Gough in Hayes Valley. Oh dear. Best coffee I&#8217;ve had in a long time. I&#8217;m trying to figure out how I can make my daily commute pass through Hayes Valley so that I can make it a normal stop. I might have to move to San Francisco in order to do it. It might be worth it. If you have a chance, and you like coffee (I had an espresso), give it a try. It&#8217;s basically just a kiosk right now, setup in what looks like it might be the future location of a real cafe. But that didn&#8217;t keep the barista from dishing out some amazing cups. By the way, apparently the <a href="http://www.worldbaristachampionship.com/default.htm">World Barista Championship</a> is being held in Seattle and ends today (Monday). The barista said he was checking blogs to try to get some news from the competition, but no one was posting anything. Maybe they have no wifi at the event. After the coffee we went over to <a href="http://www.fritzfries.com/">Fritz Fries</a>, also very interesting and something to try out if you&#8217;re a fry fan. I am. The fries are big chunky cut nuggets of potatoe though. Like English fish n&#8217; chips style fries, not like pomme frites. They have all kinds of funky dipping sauces for them, like roasted red pepper mayo and chipotle remoulade. Good. But not fantastic. Perhaps it&#8217;s just that it couldn&#8217;t possibly compare to something like Bluebottle, which landed so far beyond the expected that it&#8217;s not fair to expect the same from others. Yet I still do. Weird huh? Go to Bluebottle. Get coffee. Figure out a way to bring me a hot shot of espresso from there and you can be my new best friend.</p>
