  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mobility is a really hot topic now in the valley, and people always ask me if I know any good talent they can try to tap for their new product/service/startup. Well folks, <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2005/06/as_nokia_lifebl.html">here you go</a>. Christian Lindholm is looking for the next thing, having successfully brought <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog/">Lifeblog</a> from concept to standard component in the new NSeries of Nokia phones. Folks simply don&#8217;t come any more mobile savvy, enthusiastic, and insightful than Christian. I hope someone in the Bay Area can attract his attention, we need people like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we were <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ifindkarma/16287087/">over at Adam and Michelle Rifkin&#8217;s place for a BBQ</a>, and as it was about time to go back home <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">Tantek</a> asks &#8220;Hey, are you guys going to <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.com/Beta">SuperHappyDevHouse</a> tonight?&#8221; Oh, he&#8217;s good! We spent a bit of time debating if the car was going into the water or coming out, and promptly decided that the only sane thing to do was to head over and find out.</p>

<p>It was great. Geeks and hackers spread out all over the place doing geekish and hackery stuff. <a href="http://david.weekly.org/">David Weekly</a> got the event together, it was his house that we went to. They had a <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.com/wiki/index.cgi?HomePage">wiki available for posting project info</a> and an IRC channel for the event. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t hang out till dawn, we were pretty beat after the BBQ. We did swap around some mobile apps and have some great conversations, but I wish I had known the geekery of the gathering before heading out there.  I would have brought my GPS unit and the charger to see who else wanted to hack mapping projects. We never did find out if the car was going into the water or coming out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was fooling around with the Treo last night I sent an MMS over to <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russ</a> to test out the setup. Russ is the only person I use MMS with normally, so it&#8217;s a good control test for the system. He gets the message no problem, but the reply he sends doesn&#8217;t make it back to my phone.  We were chatting via IM as we did this, otherwise I would have had no idea he sent a message. Not a big deal, MMS is actually an IP based service, and I probably need to do manual setup of the 650 to get it working on the <a href="http://www.tmobile.com/">TMobile</a> network. But when I got up this morning I swapped my SIM back into the 6600 before Elle and I headed out. We went wandering around for the morning, picked up some groceries and ran some errands, visited her father, and were here checking email. New message on my phone, it&#8217;s the MMS that Russ sent, I had completely forgotten about it. This is about 4 hours after I swapped my SIM back into the 6600. It took that long to get the message out of whatever holding place it was in and on to my phone. I can&#8217;t believe that. I find that service level completely useless for a &#8220;messaging service&#8221;. My conclusion, I think, is that Russ and I might be the only people using MMS. I don&#8217;t think anyone else would tolerate that kind of behavior in a system. There should be all kinds of yelling and screaming going on.</p>

<p>Are you a carrier wondering why MMS hasn&#8217;t seen great uptake? It&#8217;s because it doesn&#8217;t fricking work you morons. Try testing it out in real world situations (that means cross carrier, despite what you might think people do have friends using other networks) and get it to work. Especially if you think this is going to be a high cost service. I think you&#8217;re completely cracked if you think you&#8217;re gonna be able to charge twenty five cents per message! But if you really want to, not only should it get there reliably and immediately, it should be retouched to make me look slimmer and more attractive and I should always be featured in glamorous locations. If you can&#8217;t do that then don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to see wide adoption at that price. Jeeze TMobile, the network is live, but there&#8217;s no one home. No EDGE, horrendous services, spotty coverage, a billing system that defines &#8220;automatic payment&#8221; in a way that I would consider anything but automatic. It looked so good when you picked up the Sidekick. You seemed to be getting a clue about the whole integrated services aspect. But now I&#8217;m going to have to go back to Cingular. I didn&#8217;t want to, but you&#8217;re really forcing my hand here. I just hope they don&#8217;t remember me at the Cingular store, there was some &#8220;unpleasantness&#8221; before I moved over to TMobile. I might not be welcome there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went over to <a href="http://www.palmsource.com/events/devcon2005/">Palm DevCon</a> this past week, and I won the Treo 650 they raffled off!  Lucky me, I didn&#8217;t have to buy one. Unlucky me, now I don&#8217;t have any excuses for not updating my palm software. I didn&#8217;t even turn it on till this evening, things being busy as they are. I threw my TMobile SIM into the phone and stuff &#8220;just worked&#8221;, which was pretty cool. Normally voice will just work, but you&#8217;ll have to setup other options to get data services working. I pulled up the web browser and pulled up my blog though, and it worked as it was. Nice. And then the full realization that I had an unlocked quadband GSM version sunk in. See, normally Treos come in a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000983029058/">crippled version reflecting the suckitude that is the greed of the american cellular service provider</a>. Most versions can&#8217;t be used as a Bluetooth modem with a PC. The one I have does have a dialup networking option! W00t w00t!</p>

<p>I already had my 6600 setup to do dialup networking over Bluetooth, so I figured it would be at the worst mildly annoying to get the Treo working with my Mac (OS X.3.9). Oh man, was I ever wrong. First I couldn&#8217;t pair the phone with my laptop. This isn&#8217;t rocket science, it&#8217;s one of the most basic of Bluetooth operations. Yet the process kept hanging, the Mac cycling forever waiting for some response from the phone. I took a look around and found a <a href="http://discussion.treocentral.com/showthread.php?t=71567&amp;page=2&amp;pp=20&amp;highlight=bluetooth+cingular">thread on treocentral.com talking about pairing a Treo 650 with OS X</a> and discovered that I should be pairing as &#8220;other&#8221; and not a phone. Okay, whatever, not a big deal. But even after doing that, there were no services detected for the Treo. That meant I wasn&#8217;t able to bring up the configuration I needed on the laptop to use the Bluetooth modem. So I flailed around for a while, eventually getting the laptop to rescan services AFTER being paired, and my phone finally said it could provide dialup networking. Still I couldn&#8217;t find how to configure the Bluetooth modem connection. I knew things were at least partially working though, cause I could open the tty associated with the phone and throw modem commands and see responses. But how to configure the service? Back to flailing. So without deleting the pairing I again initiated the request from the phone. This time, with the record for DUN already being pushed into the laptops information about the phone, now I got a screen that let me configure the network to use the phone. I ended up needing <a href="http://www.taniwha.org.uk/">the generic GPRS script from this set of connection scripts</a> to get the modem connected. But it worked! I snapped the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/treo-bbr.jpg">Broadband Reports chart for TMobile data using a Treo 650</a>. It&#8217;s an EDGE device, but I&#8217;m on TMobile so I don&#8217;t see any major speed increase (TMobile doesn&#8217;t have an EDGE network out here in the Bay Area).</p>

<p>So it works, I&#8217;m happy, but there are a few gotchas. The first is that you have to choose between either using Dialup Networking or using the network functions local on the device. This is an option that the user has to manually set and reset with every usage. I could pretty much be okay with only one of the two working at a time. But having the user have to switch it manually with each usage is just crazy. If only one works at a time detect the Bluetooth connection and only try to claim the network automatically if there are no open connections from phone apps. If there are then ask the user if they want to terminate the current connections to allow a Bluetooth based dialup networking session. Sounds pretty logical to me. My guess is that Palm knew that the DUN functions where going to be crippled out by carriers anway, so they didn&#8217;t bother to do it right. The other is that disconnecting the dialup session doesn&#8217;t close down the Bluetooth connection.  I need to go in and shut down the Bluetooth connection after using the networking control panel to stop the dialup session. It could be worse.. like it did with the 6600 the Mac could just fail to disconnect in an unrecoverable state. Now I need to try this out with Elle&#8217;s Cingular SIM and sample the EDGE-y goodness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I noticed something kinda odd when adding a new feed to our ad publishing system today. I test with <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> cause I love the system. It&#8217;s my normal use aggregator and by far my favorite. However I noticed that after having run my testing feeds with ads in them through Bloglines that when I went to view the source version of the feed in Bloglines it had ads in it too!  I went back and viewed the source of the feed in my browser, and sure enough there were no ads.  Hmm, it seems like my testing of the ad populated version somehow caused ads to appear in the original version. How could that be? When I test out feeds I put them in a public place, and just scp the feed output from my laptop and pass it through some web based aggregators to make sure that nothing odd happens. However I don&#8217;t change any of the links within the feed.  So although my feed might reside at, oh, I don&#8217;t know, lets say <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/herepiggypiggypiggy.xml">http://www.bitsplitter.net/herepiggypiggypiggy.xml</a>, the links within the feed still point to site the original content came from. The end result is that if you have a link like <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://www.wingedpig.com/index.rss">http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://www.wingedpig.com/index.rss</a> which would seem to subscribe you to Mark Fletcher&#8217;s blog, it really takes you to a fake post I shoved into Bloglines to make it look kinda like it&#8217;s hosted at Mark&#8217;s site. Astute subscribers will notice the mismatch between the urls in the feed info, but most people aren&#8217;t astute. I think there might be more insidious uses for this, like setting the link location for the feed to an already existing site. I don&#8217;t want to be mean and try it on existing feeds, but my little bit of fooling around would seem to indicate that the fake version could shove entries into the cache for the overall feed. So there you go Bloglines folks, there&#8217;s my free suggestion for the day. Refetch if the current cache version comes from outside the link domain and the user is requesting an &#8220;authoritative copy&#8221; (something from the same URL as the feed link).</p>

<p>Update: Niall <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://www.wingedpig.com/">did one too</a>. He helped me test out the stuff I was playing with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t been able to post much to this blog. I tried to for a while but other issues rapidly sucked up all my time. I haven&#8217;t even had time to read news except for the bits I can read on my phone while I&#8217;m wedged between two people on Caltrain. The <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2005/05/a_new_hope">post that Jay Allen has up about trying to reign in your schedule</a> really struck a chord with me. Yet here I am at 1:00 in the morning once again, testing out some code and checking to make sure that the SMS messages I&#8217;m getting from my monitoring systems are because someone else messed up and not me. Maybe I need a less stressful job, something like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/15873937/in/photostream/">Menlo Park police officer</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the time it seems like it&#8217;s worthwhile. It&#8217;s kind of a thrill to take what just about anyone would say is a trivial amount of resources and make a unique system out of it. Keep it up and running while slowly twisting it to do new things. But when you run on the edge sometimes stuff falls off. Sometimes it&#8217;s cause you screwed up. Sometimes the datacenter gets moved from one coast to another and some strange transient error causes problems no one can really pinpoint. Most of the time you expect people to react to your issues the same way you react to theirs, by showing some flexibility and dealing with it in whatever way is necessary. Occasionally there&#8217;s some friction. Especially when you&#8217;re trying to move quickly. In general the flexibility and friction balance out across the team, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forming-storming-norming-performing">bits of conflict tend to actually draw the team together rather than pull it apart</a>. But when everyone gets pissed off it&#8217;s like a swift kick in the crotch. What seemed like an intriguing set of challenges for a team quickly turns into a baffling set of obstacles when it seems like you&#8217;re doing it <a href="http://www.lyricspy.com/6521/Skunk_Anansie_lyrics/Charlie_Big_Potatoe_lyrics.html">alone</a>. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that really makes one reevaluate their own ability, what they&#8217;re doing, and who they&#8217;re doing it with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/06/issue/invite.asp?p=1">Good-Bye to Venture Capital</a> (link via <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2005/05/howard_anderson.html">Brad Feld</a>) and the whole thing seems to stand in stark contrast to what I&#8217;ve been seeing. I tend to agree more with <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/05/parting_shots.html">Fred Wilson</a>. A couple of odd things have happened directly to me over the last few weeks. Mind you, my take on this might be a bit skewed compared to other folks in Silicon Valley. I wasn&#8217;t here for the boom, I kinda missed that whole thing. I moved here mid 2001, when most people seemed to be headed out of the area and not into it. I&#8217;m not quite sure how the whole boom got started or what it looked like from the inside. But I can tell you that the previous 4 years here were nothing like the last 2 months.</p>

<p>First of all, there&#8217;s the requests that come through <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a>. We started up the group because we thought there wasn&#8217;t all that much innovative work happening in the valley with respect to mobility. It seemed like Europe was way ahead on this one, they have the huge penetration they must have the innovation. I was wrong. After starting the group innovative companies just came pouring out of the woodwork. They were out there, they just weren&#8217;t making much noise. They were below the radar of even someone like myself, who has worked in the area for a while and in general decently in tune with the technologies. Then I went over to Europe for a conference on mobility and saw the things they&#8217;re working on. The innovation is here, I&#8217;m now completely convinced. A lot of those innovators aren&#8217;t looking to VCs for funding however, and for some reason the VCs aren&#8217;t looking for them. There&#8217;s a disjoin between innovative technologies and the markets they best serve - I thought that&#8217;s what VCs were supposed to help with in part. I think some of the folks are smart enough to pull off some amazing runs. But they&#8217;re probably going to be doing it on their own.</p>

<p>The second odd thing is the number of calls I get. In my former life I did a shitload of Linux embedded systems programming, and my resume is still slanted pretty heavy in that direction. I&#8217;ve been getting unsolicited calls and emails at an increasing pace lately from folks looking to kill some existing business model using open source. The concentration seems to be pretty heavily on the networking and appliances side. I talked to three different companies yesterday alone, one of whom specifically says they&#8217;re &#8220;going straight for Cisco&#8221;. Now, granted, plays like this are pretty rational market. Open source for something like a networking device is more of an optimization than a disruption at the market level. But what happens in the adjacent areas should be pretty interesting. I think that in a few months the buzzwords might shift from the long tail to the <a href="http://management.itmanagersjournal.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/10/2052216&amp;tid=85#TheOptimizationStrategy">conservation of modularity</a> ideas that Clayton Christensen presented at the Open Source Business Conference.</p>

<p>So maybe that means nothing from the VC side. I&#8217;ve never had a few million to invest any way my little heart desires. I&#8217;ve only been on the other side of the table, where I&#8217;m sure the same world looks completely different. But from where I&#8217;m standing the opportunities seem fantastic - the problem might not be the market. Maybe VC has to (<em>GASP</em>) shift tactics in order take advantage of the current opportunities. Us folks you&#8217;ve been funding have been doing that for a while, I think the proper term for it is &#8220;business&#8221;. Take a step back, clear your mind of the millions of dollars at your disposal, and realize that you&#8217;re in business yourselves. You think you can spot innovation in the markets you&#8217;ve been investing in? Good. Cause you&#8217;re gonna have to start doing it in your own.</p>

<p>[8:22pm] waynesville: peerflix looks like mediachest</p>

<p>[8:23pm] waynesville: hmm no peerflix is different</p>

<p>[8:23pm] johnca: howso?</p>

<p>[8:23pm] waynesville: with mediachest you have to return DVDs. It&#8217;s like checking DVDs out of a library.</p>

<p>[8:24pm] waynesville: Only the &#8220;library&#8221; is someone else on the internet</p>

<p>[8:24pm] waynesville: whereas peerflix just moves a pool of DVDs around to whoever wants them</p>

<p>[8:25pm] waynesville: he&#8217;s talking about intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation</p>

<p>[8:26pm] waynesville: e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation</a></p>

<p>[8:26pm] waynesville: people who can make money from a personal passion are very lucky</p>

<p>[8:27pm] johnca: Punished By Rewards, Alfie Kohn (excellent book re intrinsic motivation)</p>

<p>[8:27pm] NiallKennedy: when is the talk going to come back to smart agents?</p>

<p>[8:28pm] waynesville: The Chinese WILL figure out a way to control information flow.</p>

<p>[8:28pm] waynesville: Just watch.</p>

<p>[8:29pm] johnca: And then the Chinese will figure out how to circumvent that control. Neh?</p>

<p>[8:29pm] johnca: (and then control will be exerted again, etc.)</p>

<p>[8:30pm] johnca: or more seriously, what makes you think that battle will be &#8220;won&#8221; by those who wish to control?</p>

<p>[8:31pm] johnca: <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">http://sciencecommons.org/</a></p>

<p>[8:31pm] JeffClavier_ joined the chat room.</p>

<p>[8:31pm] markfinnern: Science Commons: <a href="http://science.creativecommons.org/">http://science.creativecommons.org/</a></p>

<p>[8:32pm] waynesville: I thought the Chinese would not be able to control information flow on the internet, but they&#8217;ve proven me wrong (so far).</p>

<p>[8:32pm] bobcat62 joined the chat room.</p>

<p>[8:32pm] waynesville: So now my expectation is they will continue to prove me wrong</p>

<p>[8:39pm] johnca left the chat room.</p>

<p>[8:40pm] johnca joined the chat room.</p>

<p>[8:49pm] waynesville: Oh, opt-in to copyright</p>

<p>[8:49pm] waynesville: I get it now</p>

<p>[8:49pm] waynesville: I didn&#8217;t understand the question when he first asked but I get it now</p>

<p>[8:50pm] NiallKennedy: oooh, politics now</p>

<p>[8:51pm] JeffClavier left the chat room. (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))</p>

<p>[8:54pm] waynesville: video.google.com</p>

<p>[8:58pm] waynesville: I never thought I&#8217;d hear Mike Korns say &#8220;currency is not useful&#8221;</p>

<p>[8:58pm] waynesville: Ahhh &#8211; &#8220;IF information can provide food and shelter&#8221;. That will never happen.</p>

<p>[9:00pm] johnca: people lived that way for millions of years, why not?</p>

<p>[9:00pm] waynesville: Because information != energy. Food is energy.</p>
