  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey all, sorry I wasn&#8217;t able to make the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a> meeting last night. I set it all up, but then I wasn&#8217;t able to make it myself. I just had way more than is reasonable or humanly actionable to do at work. Kinda makes me sad, but mostly makes me filled with murderous rage. That&#8217;s just the way it goes however. Some people say when life gives you  lemons you should make lemonade. I say when life gives you lemons just jump up and scream &#8220;Hey! What&#8217;s with the lemons!?!? This isn&#8217;t what I asked for!!&#8221; and start chucking lemons at anyone that comes into view. They really hurt apparently. Always makes me feel better at least. I find it helps to have a blog to vent into also. We have a <a href="http://fusion94.org/archives/2005/06/new_job.html">very kick ass new addition to Feedster however</a>, so hopefully not only will my workload be getting somewhere more near normal, I might not be ignoring things in order to get it there. I would like to get things normal enough that we can have the mobile homebrew meetings again. I think that was a good idea, we just needed a little more practice with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you probably didn&#8217;t hear it here first, but <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/06/feedster_closes.html">Feedster has closed a round of funding</a>! Nothing like a little bank to help power through <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=515">some issues</a>. And things do seem to be powering along. I have no idea if I&#8217;m allowed to mention who&#8217;s joined up recently, but there are some kick ass folks joining the team. Definitely sorely needed. And there are others in line on the way in. Having a solid team come together was a major concern for me. It&#8217;s hard to ramp up such a small group. Mixing in two people to a group of ten is one kind of problem. Mixing in more than half the original group size gets into some strange group dynamics. So the next few months should be really telling. The systems have decomposed so far into completely distinct territories. One engineer worked on one system, and in general the systems broke down along well defined API boundaries. That&#8217;s not going to be the case any more, and the kind of engineering capability required to deal with that is much different than what we&#8217;ve practiced so far. I&#8217;ve been an avid user of revision control systems (CVS, Subversion, and most recently <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">GNU Arch</a>), that just grew naturally out of participating in a bunch of open source projects. As it turns out, those systems are an enormous boost when everyone knows how to use them already. But most people that I know get familiar with the &#8220;concurrent version system&#8221; methodology working on some side project and then carry it back into their work environment (classic disruptive behavior, I love it, but that&#8217;s another story). A bunch of the startups I&#8217;ve been at actually have that whole methodology baked right into the corporate DNA. The core of engineering work flows through that shared revision control system. And after a little while the concurrent version system becomes your primary collaboration tool. There&#8217;s less and less email, fewer calls, and no one throws things over the cubicle wall to get your attention any more.</p>

<p>So we come back to my original idea, which I almost forgot in my rambling. Companies structured around this open source methodology concept have a pretty natural path to scaling. The structure is instantiated inline with a revision control system that allows multiple people to just keep working and help them resolve conflicts down the line, which didn&#8217;t exist in specification driven engineering organizations I&#8217;ve been at. There are a bunch of little benefits that factor into making it a good way to work in my mind, but the principal I&#8217;m looking at now is that it&#8217;s very easy to bring new people in. So although it really seems at first glance to look like a trivial administrative task once you learn how to use it (it&#8217;s easy to forget how the concurrent version way of thinking transforms your work once you grok it) I think from an engineering standpoint the most important thing after having a good team might be having a good concurrent version system that everyone understands. It really can (and maybe should?) stand at the core of execution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After staying up till 5am this morning trying to get myself a bit caught up on news and various bits of hackery, my hands were killing me this morning. I normally use a <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">funky ergonomic contour keyboard from Kinesis</a>. It&#8217;s a complete lifesaver. I can&#8217;t live without it apparently. I tried last night, and have proven that statement to be absolutely true. I need that keyboard in order to work for long stretches without causing problems. I stopped using the keyboard when I made the switch because I didn&#8217;t know how to use it with the Mac (Powerbook, running OS X). Odd that one should have issues like &#8220;how to use a keyboard&#8221;, but unfortunately it is true. Lots of operations on a Mac require use of the apple/funky-squigly-four-leaf-clover-dealie key. Apparently called the &#8220;command&#8221; key in Mac parlance, but labeled only with pictograms. Lets call it the branding key, cause I think that&#8217;s what it really is. And it&#8217;s more descriptive than the &#8220;command&#8221; key, which I would expect to be labeled with something like, oh.. &#8220;Cmd&#8221;. When I say &#8220;branding key&#8221; to people who have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, they spot the apple key pretty quick. When I say &#8220;command key&#8221; they just can the keyboard over and over, eventually asking &#8220;You mean the control key?&#8221;</p>

<p>The branding key is pretty essential. Switching applications and windows, cut, paste. All necessary stuff for keeping you from reaching for the mouse, which destroys a lot the benefit of the good keyboard. But today it was too painful, I had to use the Kinesis, and I had to figure out how to create a branding key on a (GASP!) standard US keyboard. Russ pointed me to <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/">DoubleCommand</a>, which lets you remap keys under OS X. Perfect. All I had to do was install that, set the flag that says &#8220;Option key acts as command key&#8221;, and I was all set. Now I can hold down Alt on the Kinesis and it has the same effect as the branding key on the built in keyboard. The shooting pains have all but stopped, and I think I should be able to feel my fingertips again by the end of the day. Happy dance!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mobility is a really hot topic now in the valley, and people always ask me if I know any good talent they can try to tap for their new product/service/startup. Well folks, <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2005/06/as_nokia_lifebl.html">here you go</a>. Christian Lindholm is looking for the next thing, having successfully brought <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog/">Lifeblog</a> from concept to standard component in the new NSeries of Nokia phones. Folks simply don&#8217;t come any more mobile savvy, enthusiastic, and insightful than Christian. I hope someone in the Bay Area can attract his attention, we need people like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we were <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ifindkarma/16287087/">over at Adam and Michelle Rifkin&#8217;s place for a BBQ</a>, and as it was about time to go back home <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">Tantek</a> asks &#8220;Hey, are you guys going to <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.com/Beta">SuperHappyDevHouse</a> tonight?&#8221; Oh, he&#8217;s good! We spent a bit of time debating if the car was going into the water or coming out, and promptly decided that the only sane thing to do was to head over and find out.</p>

<p>It was great. Geeks and hackers spread out all over the place doing geekish and hackery stuff. <a href="http://david.weekly.org/">David Weekly</a> got the event together, it was his house that we went to. They had a <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.com/wiki/index.cgi?HomePage">wiki available for posting project info</a> and an IRC channel for the event. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t hang out till dawn, we were pretty beat after the BBQ. We did swap around some mobile apps and have some great conversations, but I wish I had known the geekery of the gathering before heading out there.  I would have brought my GPS unit and the charger to see who else wanted to hack mapping projects. We never did find out if the car was going into the water or coming out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was fooling around with the Treo last night I sent an MMS over to <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russ</a> to test out the setup. Russ is the only person I use MMS with normally, so it&#8217;s a good control test for the system. He gets the message no problem, but the reply he sends doesn&#8217;t make it back to my phone.  We were chatting via IM as we did this, otherwise I would have had no idea he sent a message. Not a big deal, MMS is actually an IP based service, and I probably need to do manual setup of the 650 to get it working on the <a href="http://www.tmobile.com/">TMobile</a> network. But when I got up this morning I swapped my SIM back into the 6600 before Elle and I headed out. We went wandering around for the morning, picked up some groceries and ran some errands, visited her father, and were here checking email. New message on my phone, it&#8217;s the MMS that Russ sent, I had completely forgotten about it. This is about 4 hours after I swapped my SIM back into the 6600. It took that long to get the message out of whatever holding place it was in and on to my phone. I can&#8217;t believe that. I find that service level completely useless for a &#8220;messaging service&#8221;. My conclusion, I think, is that Russ and I might be the only people using MMS. I don&#8217;t think anyone else would tolerate that kind of behavior in a system. There should be all kinds of yelling and screaming going on.</p>

<p>Are you a carrier wondering why MMS hasn&#8217;t seen great uptake? It&#8217;s because it doesn&#8217;t fricking work you morons. Try testing it out in real world situations (that means cross carrier, despite what you might think people do have friends using other networks) and get it to work. Especially if you think this is going to be a high cost service. I think you&#8217;re completely cracked if you think you&#8217;re gonna be able to charge twenty five cents per message! But if you really want to, not only should it get there reliably and immediately, it should be retouched to make me look slimmer and more attractive and I should always be featured in glamorous locations. If you can&#8217;t do that then don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to see wide adoption at that price. Jeeze TMobile, the network is live, but there&#8217;s no one home. No EDGE, horrendous services, spotty coverage, a billing system that defines &#8220;automatic payment&#8221; in a way that I would consider anything but automatic. It looked so good when you picked up the Sidekick. You seemed to be getting a clue about the whole integrated services aspect. But now I&#8217;m going to have to go back to Cingular. I didn&#8217;t want to, but you&#8217;re really forcing my hand here. I just hope they don&#8217;t remember me at the Cingular store, there was some &#8220;unpleasantness&#8221; before I moved over to TMobile. I might not be welcome there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went over to <a href="http://www.palmsource.com/events/devcon2005/">Palm DevCon</a> this past week, and I won the Treo 650 they raffled off!  Lucky me, I didn&#8217;t have to buy one. Unlucky me, now I don&#8217;t have any excuses for not updating my palm software. I didn&#8217;t even turn it on till this evening, things being busy as they are. I threw my TMobile SIM into the phone and stuff &#8220;just worked&#8221;, which was pretty cool. Normally voice will just work, but you&#8217;ll have to setup other options to get data services working. I pulled up the web browser and pulled up my blog though, and it worked as it was. Nice. And then the full realization that I had an unlocked quadband GSM version sunk in. See, normally Treos come in a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000983029058/">crippled version reflecting the suckitude that is the greed of the american cellular service provider</a>. Most versions can&#8217;t be used as a Bluetooth modem with a PC. The one I have does have a dialup networking option! W00t w00t!</p>

<p>I already had my 6600 setup to do dialup networking over Bluetooth, so I figured it would be at the worst mildly annoying to get the Treo working with my Mac (OS X.3.9). Oh man, was I ever wrong. First I couldn&#8217;t pair the phone with my laptop. This isn&#8217;t rocket science, it&#8217;s one of the most basic of Bluetooth operations. Yet the process kept hanging, the Mac cycling forever waiting for some response from the phone. I took a look around and found a <a href="http://discussion.treocentral.com/showthread.php?t=71567&amp;page=2&amp;pp=20&amp;highlight=bluetooth+cingular">thread on treocentral.com talking about pairing a Treo 650 with OS X</a> and discovered that I should be pairing as &#8220;other&#8221; and not a phone. Okay, whatever, not a big deal. But even after doing that, there were no services detected for the Treo. That meant I wasn&#8217;t able to bring up the configuration I needed on the laptop to use the Bluetooth modem. So I flailed around for a while, eventually getting the laptop to rescan services AFTER being paired, and my phone finally said it could provide dialup networking. Still I couldn&#8217;t find how to configure the Bluetooth modem connection. I knew things were at least partially working though, cause I could open the tty associated with the phone and throw modem commands and see responses. But how to configure the service? Back to flailing. So without deleting the pairing I again initiated the request from the phone. This time, with the record for DUN already being pushed into the laptops information about the phone, now I got a screen that let me configure the network to use the phone. I ended up needing <a href="http://www.taniwha.org.uk/">the generic GPRS script from this set of connection scripts</a> to get the modem connected. But it worked! I snapped the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/treo-bbr.jpg">Broadband Reports chart for TMobile data using a Treo 650</a>. It&#8217;s an EDGE device, but I&#8217;m on TMobile so I don&#8217;t see any major speed increase (TMobile doesn&#8217;t have an EDGE network out here in the Bay Area).</p>

<p>So it works, I&#8217;m happy, but there are a few gotchas. The first is that you have to choose between either using Dialup Networking or using the network functions local on the device. This is an option that the user has to manually set and reset with every usage. I could pretty much be okay with only one of the two working at a time. But having the user have to switch it manually with each usage is just crazy. If only one works at a time detect the Bluetooth connection and only try to claim the network automatically if there are no open connections from phone apps. If there are then ask the user if they want to terminate the current connections to allow a Bluetooth based dialup networking session. Sounds pretty logical to me. My guess is that Palm knew that the DUN functions where going to be crippled out by carriers anway, so they didn&#8217;t bother to do it right. The other is that disconnecting the dialup session doesn&#8217;t close down the Bluetooth connection.  I need to go in and shut down the Bluetooth connection after using the networking control panel to stop the dialup session. It could be worse.. like it did with the 6600 the Mac could just fail to disconnect in an unrecoverable state. Now I need to try this out with Elle&#8217;s Cingular SIM and sample the EDGE-y goodness.</p>
