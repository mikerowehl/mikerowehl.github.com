  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I don&#8217;t agree with the overall conclusion, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sriram/archive/2006/01/15/lisp_is_sin.aspx">this essay points to a number of great resources and ties together a line of discussion about Lisp and Scheme very well</a>. I agree with trying to make programming accessable to a larger audience (<a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/12/raising_collect.html">especially after hearing Doug Egelbart speak the other day</a>), but the flip side of that is that a lot of the people programming are not really &#8220;computer folk&#8221;. It would be great to have someone interested in creating their own wep application be able to do so without being a programmer in the traditional sense, but once that&#8217;s possible people probably won&#8217;t start calling themselves programmers once we start using sufficiently abstracted tools.</p>

<p>So from that end I can see a lot of the points that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">Joel has made</a>. Many current programmers exist in some kind of nether region. They&#8217;re not domain experts in any outside field, but they&#8217;re not equipped to solve the hard problems of computer science or engineering either. That&#8217;s just an artifact of the current state of the art of computer programming not being good enough that the average user can pick up the tools and do what they want. It&#8217;s my hope that we evolve away from the middleman programmers being necessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been getting pinged on IM this morning about my reaction to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/20/ning-rip/">Mike  from TechCrunch ripping into Ning today</a>. I&#8217;ve spoken to Mike a  few times and always got the impression he&#8217;s the kind of person who  honestly speaks his mind. So sometimes of course we&#8217;re going to be on  the receiving end of some criticism, goes with the territory, and I  don&#8217;t come even vaguely close to having a problem with it.</p>

<p>Gina (CEO at Ning) already commented on the post to try to work through  some of the areas where there might be issues. I want to comment on one  specific area that I think is a complete misconception however: that no  one is using Ning. That&#8217;s just not true at all.  We&#8217;re adding  applications and users every day, they&#8217;re just not necessarily users  from among the blogging public that normally frequents new application  and service releases.  They&#8217;re people who come to the site because they  have an application they want to build, not because they hop from  platform to platform and toolset to toolset trying out everything they  can get their hands on.</p>

<p>As a result a lot of our communication and recent improvements have been  focused on that class of users.  We&#8217;re most interested in making the  site make sense to someone who arrives with the question &#8220;How can I  create an application that helps my chess club track the results of  games?&#8221;  Not folks who come with the question &#8220;How does this compare to  Jot?&#8221; or &#8220;Why would I use this instead of setting up my own server?&#8221;  So  unfortunately we leave lots of questions the techies have unanswered in  trying to make the site approachable for the casual user.</p>

<p>We want to make a <strong>new</strong> service, something that allows people who couldn&#8217;t  get their application online before to easily clone and setup the site  they want.  That results in something that isn&#8217;t necessarily compelling  for the kind of person who spends their life online and knows how to  setup a server and database.  We don&#8217;t want to be appealing to everyone,  we want to be compelling for a group of users who currently aren&#8217;t being  served very well.  Those folks aren&#8217;t talking about mashups or web  services APIs, and they&#8217;ll look at you funny if you mention those terms.   Figuring out how to give them the tools they need to make their site  without imposing too much burden on them is our focus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t use Flash normally, but I installed it (with the <a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">flashblock plugin for Firefox</a> of course) so that I can fool around with <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, which renders views in little flash applets. Cool, as much as I don&#8217;t like Flash normally it&#8217;s a nice path to transition to richer functionality on the client side later on, so it makes sense in this context. The problem was that I wasn&#8217;t getting any text in Flash. I found <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Installation_Instructions">the answer on the OpenLaszlo wiki</a> quickly enough, the font that Flash uses is in the ghostscript package:</p>

<blockquote><p>apt-get install gsfonts-x11</p></blockquote>

<p>Mmmm, graphs with labels now. Peachy. And of course I&#8217;ve spent some time mucking around with <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> as well. But we don&#8217;t need to talk about that. I have just one thing to say: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=robot+chicken">Robot Chicken</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting article over at OnLamp called <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/12/no_oss_community.html?page=1">There Is No Open Source Community</a>. Some excellent points in there, the central being that open source is not driven by ideological crusaders, but by the straightforward economic benefic of participants. I would disagree with the title of the article however. There is an open source community, definitely. It isn&#8217;t what companies should be focused on while evaluating open source, it isn&#8217;t the major driving contribution to the continued success of open source projects. But it is there and it does play a role in the environment. To say that it&#8217;s been giving too much attention isn&#8217;t probably right either, just that the time given it is out of line with the time spent looking at the basic economics of the environment. Given that, the article is an excellent attempt to start demystifying a subject that&#8217;s been clouded with way too much rhetoric on both sides of the argument.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aww yea, starting up the <a href="http://engadget.com/2006/01/12/new-zealands-rakon-develops-worlds-smallest-gps-receiver/">talk about implanted electronics</a> is a sure way to get my attention. Although knowing GPS you could probably get the chip implanted subcutaneous but then need a large dish antenna grafted to your forehead in order to use it, and it would still only work outside under clear conditions. I wonder if maybe I could just plan to hook it up to the adamantium in the skeletal grafts I have planned and use that for reception? I wonder where I&#8217;ll have to store the maps to go along with it&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to think about it.</p>

<p>Update: Russ just pasted me <a href="http://images.southparkstudios.com/media/images/101/satelite_dish.gif">this South Park image</a> to go along with the post, and I just wanted to share. Fricking hysterical.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the cooler features of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress 2.0</a> is supposed to be the <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet plugin for spam filtering</a>. The last couple of days must have put me on all the spam target lists. I just cleared out about 150 spam comments over the last three hours, and don&#8217;t really feel like having to do that too often. So I turned on the Akismet plugin to see how that works out. I already had a <a href="http://miker.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com account</a> (required for the API key), so setup was easy. Take that Cialis hawking freaks!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We failed in <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=600">the quest for 100 cups of coffee in 48 hours</a>. We both made it up to 75 however, which is a pretty respectable showing. I think 100 is possible, we just need to schedule it out better.  Both of us stopped for a while yesterday, while we probably could have kept going if we didn&#8217;t have things to do. So next attempt (and yes! there will be another attempt) will be scheduled on something like vacation days, or a weekend at least. The espresso certainly helped out to keep the volume of liquid down, we&#8217;ll probably include more of that next time. Keeping meals simple but frequent made a huge difference for me. And antacid, lots and lots of antacid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to pause for a while last night so that I could get some work done. I just couldn&#8217;t concentrate after 36 cups in 24 hours. I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/">back at it for a little while now though</a>. Hopefully I&#8217;ll at least make 75 cups. I got no sleep last night, so this is as much of a survival technique as a continuation of the challenge.  20 cups over the next 6 hours.. that sounds doable. Someone yesterday suggested antacids, fantastic suggestion. So I&#8217;ve layed down a preemptive layer of those this morning.  Those Tums chewables in assorted tropical fruit flavors are actually really good. I would eat them like candy if I had them around all the time. The white ones are my favorites, not sure what flavor it&#8217;s supposed to be but it&#8217;s damn good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think &#8220;choked down&#8221; would be an appropriate description for how I handled the last cup. And it was definitely shaking. I don&#8217;t like my coffee shaking. So I just setup <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/84313597/">cup 20</a> and then I&#8217;m taking a pause for at least a little while. We started at 5:30pm on Sunday. Will we make 100 cups by 5:30pm on Tuesday? It&#8217;s looking a little iffy. I remain optimistic however - the challenge will continue tomorrow.</p>
