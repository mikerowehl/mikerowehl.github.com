  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/cgi-bin/blog.cgi/2006/01/30#van_slides">slides from Van Jacobson&#8217;s LCA2006 presentation</a> are online. They talk about an evolution to the Linux networking stack targeted at taking into account multicore systems. If I had to summarize the presentation I would steal the title from slide 16: &#8220;The end of the wire isn&#8217;t the end of the net&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>On a uni-processor it doesn&#8217;t matter, but on a multi-processor the protocol work should be done on the processor that&#8217;s going to consume the data.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means ISR and Softint should do almost nothing and Socket should do everything.</p>

<p>The slides are excellent and lay out the issue very clearly, but I would also recommend checking out <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/cgi-bin/blog.cgi/2006/01/27#vj_channels">DaveM&#8217;s comments on net channels</a>. It was his writeup that turned me on to the presentation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I&#8217;m not at all looking, I keep <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/MikeRowehl.txt">a copy of my resume up online</a>. Why? Because sometimes a recruiter will call and drop a nice nugget of info to you. That&#8217;s exactly what happened this morning. I got a call from a recruiter for <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> looking for Linux programmers. There&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/07/27/netflix-close-to-offering-online-movie-downloads/">speculation going on for a little while about how Netflix will deliver their on demand download service</a>. The recruiter said the project included a team of engineers from ReplayTV, AOL, and Tivo to work on a consumer device. So I looked around on their site, and <a href="http://jobs.netflix.com/DetailFlix.asp?flix1168">here&#8217;s the job listing</a>. So who knows if it&#8217;ll see the light of day, but it would appear that the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118006,00.asp">Tivo/Netflix collaboration that was floating around during 2004</a> is still in process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re <a href="http://blog.ning.com/2006/01/were_looking_for_the_newest_me.html">looking for a new developer at Ning</a>.Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://jobs.ning.com/group.php?FAQGroup:title=Development#faq-651075">complete description</a>. Like Gina says, the team is fantastic. Everyone here knows their shit inside and out, including an ops team that I&#8217;ve just simply never seen the equal to before. The egineers are all fantastic. The project is interesting. The area is great (the offices are in downtown Palo Alto, how much ass does that kick?) It&#8217;s got the whole shebang.
If you&#8217;re the kind of person who hops out of bed in the middle of the night sometimes because you think you have a solution to the problem you were working on during the day, we might have a job for you. Drop us a line.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reclusive mobile technology pundit and Internet crackpot Russell Beattie <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008772.html">posted recently about the increasing number of sensationalist posts</a> out in the bloggosphere. What does it mean? Well I for one think it spells out doom. DOOOM!!!! Doomy doomy doom spreading all over the place. And then a light lunch. Won&#8217;t someone please think about the children!</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s see if that gets me up on <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>. Got some name calling, sensationalism. Right, need someone to blame. How about <a href="http://nate.calc.org/webalbum/fun/images/osama%20bin%20laden%20(bert%20is%20evil">Evil Bert</a>_jpg.jpg)? The <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20060124">Userfriendly linked in the comments to Russ&#8217;s post</a> is hysterical too, check that out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/">Chicken</a> every once in a while, particularly when fooling around with web stuff. They have some kick ass extensions : <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/http.html">basic HTTP</a>, <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/spiffy.html">more featurefull web server</a>, <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/ssax.html">XML query and generation</a>. I first ran across it looking at some <a href="http://www.double.co.nz/scheme/modal-web-server.html">modal web programming samples</a> and have continued to like it ever since. However I just &#8216;apt-get chicken&#8217; installed the environment on my Ubuntu system only to find that the build was very very much out of date. Most of the extensions I installed failed to load into the interpreter cause names have changed or the extensions use new features. So I downloaded Chicken 2.2 source and installed from that in about 15 seconds.  Just figured I would post in case anyone run across problems with Chicken on Ubuntu when trying to just use chicken-setup to install eggs. If you&#8217;re pointed at the same repositories I am you probably got a 1.6 build from 2004, that&#8217;s the problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I don&#8217;t agree with the overall conclusion, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sriram/archive/2006/01/15/lisp_is_sin.aspx">this essay points to a number of great resources and ties together a line of discussion about Lisp and Scheme very well</a>. I agree with trying to make programming accessable to a larger audience (<a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/12/raising_collect.html">especially after hearing Doug Egelbart speak the other day</a>), but the flip side of that is that a lot of the people programming are not really &#8220;computer folk&#8221;. It would be great to have someone interested in creating their own wep application be able to do so without being a programmer in the traditional sense, but once that&#8217;s possible people probably won&#8217;t start calling themselves programmers once we start using sufficiently abstracted tools.</p>

<p>So from that end I can see a lot of the points that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">Joel has made</a>. Many current programmers exist in some kind of nether region. They&#8217;re not domain experts in any outside field, but they&#8217;re not equipped to solve the hard problems of computer science or engineering either. That&#8217;s just an artifact of the current state of the art of computer programming not being good enough that the average user can pick up the tools and do what they want. It&#8217;s my hope that we evolve away from the middleman programmers being necessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been getting pinged on IM this morning about my reaction to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/20/ning-rip/">Mike  from TechCrunch ripping into Ning today</a>. I&#8217;ve spoken to Mike a  few times and always got the impression he&#8217;s the kind of person who  honestly speaks his mind. So sometimes of course we&#8217;re going to be on  the receiving end of some criticism, goes with the territory, and I  don&#8217;t come even vaguely close to having a problem with it.</p>

<p>Gina (CEO at Ning) already commented on the post to try to work through  some of the areas where there might be issues. I want to comment on one  specific area that I think is a complete misconception however: that no  one is using Ning. That&#8217;s just not true at all.  We&#8217;re adding  applications and users every day, they&#8217;re just not necessarily users  from among the blogging public that normally frequents new application  and service releases.  They&#8217;re people who come to the site because they  have an application they want to build, not because they hop from  platform to platform and toolset to toolset trying out everything they  can get their hands on.</p>

<p>As a result a lot of our communication and recent improvements have been  focused on that class of users.  We&#8217;re most interested in making the  site make sense to someone who arrives with the question &#8220;How can I  create an application that helps my chess club track the results of  games?&#8221;  Not folks who come with the question &#8220;How does this compare to  Jot?&#8221; or &#8220;Why would I use this instead of setting up my own server?&#8221;  So  unfortunately we leave lots of questions the techies have unanswered in  trying to make the site approachable for the casual user.</p>

<p>We want to make a <strong>new</strong> service, something that allows people who couldn&#8217;t  get their application online before to easily clone and setup the site  they want.  That results in something that isn&#8217;t necessarily compelling  for the kind of person who spends their life online and knows how to  setup a server and database.  We don&#8217;t want to be appealing to everyone,  we want to be compelling for a group of users who currently aren&#8217;t being  served very well.  Those folks aren&#8217;t talking about mashups or web  services APIs, and they&#8217;ll look at you funny if you mention those terms.   Figuring out how to give them the tools they need to make their site  without imposing too much burden on them is our focus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t use Flash normally, but I installed it (with the <a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">flashblock plugin for Firefox</a> of course) so that I can fool around with <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, which renders views in little flash applets. Cool, as much as I don&#8217;t like Flash normally it&#8217;s a nice path to transition to richer functionality on the client side later on, so it makes sense in this context. The problem was that I wasn&#8217;t getting any text in Flash. I found <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Installation_Instructions">the answer on the OpenLaszlo wiki</a> quickly enough, the font that Flash uses is in the ghostscript package:</p>

<blockquote><p>apt-get install gsfonts-x11</p></blockquote>

<p>Mmmm, graphs with labels now. Peachy. And of course I&#8217;ve spent some time mucking around with <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> as well. But we don&#8217;t need to talk about that. I have just one thing to say: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=robot+chicken">Robot Chicken</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting article over at OnLamp called <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/12/no_oss_community.html?page=1">There Is No Open Source Community</a>. Some excellent points in there, the central being that open source is not driven by ideological crusaders, but by the straightforward economic benefic of participants. I would disagree with the title of the article however. There is an open source community, definitely. It isn&#8217;t what companies should be focused on while evaluating open source, it isn&#8217;t the major driving contribution to the continued success of open source projects. But it is there and it does play a role in the environment. To say that it&#8217;s been giving too much attention isn&#8217;t probably right either, just that the time given it is out of line with the time spent looking at the basic economics of the environment. Given that, the article is an excellent attempt to start demystifying a subject that&#8217;s been clouded with way too much rhetoric on both sides of the argument.</p>
