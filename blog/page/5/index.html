  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t use Flash normally, but I installed it (with the <a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">flashblock plugin for Firefox</a> of course) so that I can fool around with <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, which renders views in little flash applets. Cool, as much as I don&#8217;t like Flash normally it&#8217;s a nice path to transition to richer functionality on the client side later on, so it makes sense in this context. The problem was that I wasn&#8217;t getting any text in Flash. I found <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Installation_Instructions">the answer on the OpenLaszlo wiki</a> quickly enough, the font that Flash uses is in the ghostscript package:</p>

<blockquote><p>apt-get install gsfonts-x11</p></blockquote>

<p>Mmmm, graphs with labels now. Peachy. And of course I&#8217;ve spent some time mucking around with <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> as well. But we don&#8217;t need to talk about that. I have just one thing to say: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=robot+chicken">Robot Chicken</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting article over at OnLamp called <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/12/no_oss_community.html?page=1">There Is No Open Source Community</a>. Some excellent points in there, the central being that open source is not driven by ideological crusaders, but by the straightforward economic benefic of participants. I would disagree with the title of the article however. There is an open source community, definitely. It isn&#8217;t what companies should be focused on while evaluating open source, it isn&#8217;t the major driving contribution to the continued success of open source projects. But it is there and it does play a role in the environment. To say that it&#8217;s been giving too much attention isn&#8217;t probably right either, just that the time given it is out of line with the time spent looking at the basic economics of the environment. Given that, the article is an excellent attempt to start demystifying a subject that&#8217;s been clouded with way too much rhetoric on both sides of the argument.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aww yea, starting up the <a href="http://engadget.com/2006/01/12/new-zealands-rakon-develops-worlds-smallest-gps-receiver/">talk about implanted electronics</a> is a sure way to get my attention. Although knowing GPS you could probably get the chip implanted subcutaneous but then need a large dish antenna grafted to your forehead in order to use it, and it would still only work outside under clear conditions. I wonder if maybe I could just plan to hook it up to the adamantium in the skeletal grafts I have planned and use that for reception? I wonder where I&#8217;ll have to store the maps to go along with it&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to think about it.</p>

<p>Update: Russ just pasted me <a href="http://images.southparkstudios.com/media/images/101/satelite_dish.gif">this South Park image</a> to go along with the post, and I just wanted to share. Fricking hysterical.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the cooler features of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress 2.0</a> is supposed to be the <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet plugin for spam filtering</a>. The last couple of days must have put me on all the spam target lists. I just cleared out about 150 spam comments over the last three hours, and don&#8217;t really feel like having to do that too often. So I turned on the Akismet plugin to see how that works out. I already had a <a href="http://miker.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com account</a> (required for the API key), so setup was easy. Take that Cialis hawking freaks!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We failed in <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=600">the quest for 100 cups of coffee in 48 hours</a>. We both made it up to 75 however, which is a pretty respectable showing. I think 100 is possible, we just need to schedule it out better.  Both of us stopped for a while yesterday, while we probably could have kept going if we didn&#8217;t have things to do. So next attempt (and yes! there will be another attempt) will be scheduled on something like vacation days, or a weekend at least. The espresso certainly helped out to keep the volume of liquid down, we&#8217;ll probably include more of that next time. Keeping meals simple but frequent made a huge difference for me. And antacid, lots and lots of antacid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to pause for a while last night so that I could get some work done. I just couldn&#8217;t concentrate after 36 cups in 24 hours. I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/">back at it for a little while now though</a>. Hopefully I&#8217;ll at least make 75 cups. I got no sleep last night, so this is as much of a survival technique as a continuation of the challenge.  20 cups over the next 6 hours.. that sounds doable. Someone yesterday suggested antacids, fantastic suggestion. So I&#8217;ve layed down a preemptive layer of those this morning.  Those Tums chewables in assorted tropical fruit flavors are actually really good. I would eat them like candy if I had them around all the time. The white ones are my favorites, not sure what flavor it&#8217;s supposed to be but it&#8217;s damn good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think &#8220;choked down&#8221; would be an appropriate description for how I handled the last cup. And it was definitely shaking. I don&#8217;t like my coffee shaking. So I just setup <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/84313597/">cup 20</a> and then I&#8217;m taking a pause for at least a little while. We started at 5:30pm on Sunday. Will we make 100 cups by 5:30pm on Tuesday? It&#8217;s looking a little iffy. I remain optimistic however - the challenge will continue tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=600">mentioned the other day that I wanted to drink 100 cups of coffee in 48 hours</a>. <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003314.html">Diego was down with it</a>. And we&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008731.html">encouraged, insulted, applauded, and dismissed in Russ&#8217;s comments</a>. It&#8217;s stupid, it&#8217;s pointless, it&#8217;s dangerous&#8230; so of course we just have to do it. The challenge has started!! 100 cups of coffee in 48 hours. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker">Photos getting posted to FLickr</a> as the madness unfolds. To those who encouraged us, thanks! To those who said it can&#8217;t be done.. maybe you&#8217;re right we&#8217;ll see. But we&#8217;re not afraid to try! To those who called us idiots, well, you folks may have a point. But we&#8217;ll be higly caffeinated idiots, so it&#8217;s all good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started using <a href="http://www.43things.com">43Things</a> finally, and one of my goals is to <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/301170">drink 100 cups of coffee</a>. This is in homage to <a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Capsules/4ACV16/">the Futurama episode where Fry drinks 100 cups of coffee</a> and reaches some kind of enlightenment. Sure, it&#8217;s a cartoon and all, but it still looked like fun. And I think it&#8217;s important to have goals, no matter how inane they might be. Most people say something like &#8220;you know it is possible to overdose on caffeine?&#8221; or &#8220;that would probably kill you&#8221;. Generally discouraging remarks. But thanks to Wikipedia I think I might be looking at a plausible goal. Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine entry</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LD50">LD</a>50 of caffeine is estimated between 13 and 19 grams for oral administration for an average adult. The LD50 of caffeine is dependent on weight and individual sensitivity and estimated to be about 150 to 200 mg per kg of body mass, roughly 140 to 180 cups of coffee for an average adult taken within a limited timeframe that is dependent on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life#Half-life_in_chemistry">half-life</a>. The half-life, or time it takes for the amount of caffeine in the blood to decrease by 50%, ranges from 3.5 to 10 hours. In adults the half-life is generally around 5 hours. However, contraceptive pills increase this to around 12 hours, and, for women over 3 months pregnant, it varies from 10 to 18 hours. In infants and young children, the half-life may be longer than in adults. With common coffee and a very rare half-life of 100 hours, it would require 3 cups of coffee every hour for 100 hours just to reach LD50.</p></blockquote>

<p>3 cups of coffee every hour for 100 hours, see that? And my goal is just 2 cups of coffee for 48 hours. That should be well below the lethal dosage. I just got a large capacity coffee maker for home, I&#8217;m thinking this would be a great way to test it out. 2006 has been a great year so far and we&#8217;re not even a week in. How much would it rock to knock down a long standing goal before the end of January? A lot, that&#8217;s how much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just updated to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress 2.0</a> for this blog. Normally the next thing people say is &#8220;great, now update the templates!&#8221; You know what? No. I&#8217;m not even going to try this time.</p>

<p>Normally I say to myself &#8220;Hey, they&#8217;re right! It&#8217;s about time I learned how to do some layout.&#8221; And every time I try I just rediscover that I suck at layout. It&#8217;s not what I do. I&#8217;m not going to come up with anything tolerable (unless you count the time I just stripped all the formattting out all together). I don&#8217;t ask you to write kernel drivers for me, do I? So I&#8217;m not writing CSS for you. I just think that&#8217;s fair.</p>

<p>Every time I end up wasting big chunks of time and telling myself I&#8217;m just going to live with the default format. Most people read the stuff via feed anyway and probably have no idea what my blog looks like. What if you really just have a completely violent reaction to the default formatting for Wordpress? Try out browsing through something like <a href="http://www.skweezer.net">Skweezer</a>. The results are pretty much what my last attempt at CSS ended up looking like, so you&#8217;re not missing anything.</p>
