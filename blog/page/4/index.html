Apparently we have enough free time that we should be able to host folks whenever they feel like stopping by, but Kevin was just too busy to attend <a href="http://kalsey.com/2006/02/visit_ning/">the meetup he was instrumental in organizing</a>. Burton, come on, we got cupcakes and everything! I almost cried, but it was okay. A bunch of folks from the Facebook showed up, including <a href="http://www.okdork.com/">Noah</a>, who&#8217;s birthday is this Friday by the way. So if you see him at the TechCrunch BBQ make sure to make him drink a shot in celebration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.sklar.com/blog/">David</a> sent a link to <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4412806662713775705">this video, Monkey vs. Robot</a>, this morning. If there&#8217;s anything more funny than a person in a robot suit fighting with a person in aÂ  monkey suit, it&#8217;s a Monkey vs. Robot music video complete with crayon style title shots. We have a bit of a monkey fixation going on, which started with a rereading of the classic Onion story, <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30420">Super Monkey Collider Loses Funding</a>. Which was followed by an extended brainstorming session regarding what one could do with a large group of monkeys if one weren&#8217;t planning to slam them together at high speed. Let me tell you, with some of the big brains we have around Ning, the sky is the limit when it comes to monkey technology. Monkey based power backup systems, the million monkey literature project, and the monkey crossbar switching fabric. Great projects, I can&#8217;t wait till we get started on them! The video made me realize however that we were overlooking the use of robots&#8230;. with the <a href="http://news.com.com/Sony+puts+Aibo+to+sleep/2100-1041_3-6031649.html">Aibo folks out of work</a>, maybe we can pick them up to work on systems for the datacenter. They call me crazy because I dare to dream. Dream of a race of robotic atomic supermonsters that drink blood&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/">Diego</a>&#8217;s brother is in town, and he brought with him many treats composed primarily of <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche">dulce de leche</a>. Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t read spanish, neither can I. But here&#8217;s a rough translation for dulce de leche: really fucking good. It&#8217;s kinda like caramel, but not quite. Kinda got a frosting-ish/pudding-ish consistency sorta. It&#8217;s one of those things you apparently just have to experience to understand. If someone offers you something and mentions dulce de leche, take it. It&#8217;ll send you straight into diabetic coma, but it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I frequently tell people that I can sleep just about anywhere if I&#8217;m tired enough, they don&#8217;t believe me. We have a lot going on at Ning, so I&#8217;ve had a few chances to exercise that ability in the last few days. Diego snapped a pic of me sleeping in my chair with people wandering around:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/97374473/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/37/97374473_af254951d1.jpg" alt="naptime" /></a></p>

<p>Not a fantastic nap, but it gets the job done. I&#8217;m thinking about trying out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">crazy ass polyphasic sleep thing</a> where you only sleep 3 or 4 hours a day in short naps. I&#8217;m only sleeping four hours a day as it is, if there&#8217;s a way to make it more effective might as well give it a try, right? And no, the 4 hours of sleep a day has <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=601">nothing to do with the coffee</a>. It started way before then. It&#8217;s insomnia. I&#8217;m usually up all night thinking about coffee.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just saw the new look at <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a>, very nice! The search results are much much snappier than I can remember them being for a good long while. Some folks are complaining about <a href="http://www.makeyougohmm.com/?p=2926">a lack of new features</a>, but I read <a href="http://www.feedster.com/blog/2006/02/06/new-feedster-sitenew-features/">the entry about the release</a> as saying &#8220;New site, new features coming soon&#8221;. Personally I would rather just have a site that works for search than a feature rich site that sometimes tells me the load is too high. Cause you know when I&#8217;m really gonna want those results? When there&#8217;s a news event, during which the load is normally high.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russ and I were talking about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008792.html">the SMS.ac thing</a> last night on the way to MoMo. Today RCR Wireless <a href="http://www.rcrnews.com/news.cms?newsId=25553">picked up the story</a>, with this quote from the SMS.ac folks:</p>

<blockquote><p>In essence, we have a fiduciary duty to protect our company, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bull fucking shit! You had a fiduciary duty to not be complete fucktards in the first place, but apparently that wasn&#8217;t in the cards was it? Now you&#8217;re trying to rewrite history in an attempt to salvage your reputation? Well suing people who write about your misdeeds is not the way to do it. Ceasing activities that indicate fucktarditude (of which the cease and decist letter is one) is the way to salvage your reputation. And then you get people to say good things about you. Anyone have a form letter for &#8220;cease and decist fucktarditude&#8221;? I have a need for one.</p>

<p>Update: for SMS.ac, here&#8217;s some help in tracking down all those nasty nasty detractors from your sterling public image:</p>

<p>And the list goes on and on, just check the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sms.ac+scam">Google search results for &#8220;SMS.ac scam&#8221;</a>.

I&#8217;m betting it leads to somewhere around San Diego&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A bunch of folks seized on <a href="http://kalsey.com/blog/2006/02/those_pesky_customers/">the point that Adam calls out in his post</a>, that we took the Ning sign down to keep folks from randomly dropping in. Somehow that&#8217;s equated to not wanting to talk to our customers. Still trying to figure that one out. If we took the firewall down around our office network and took the encryption off our wireless network would that help also? Are people randomly dropping by Cingular and Microsoft just to chat the folks up?</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line apparently &#8220;solving problems in a way that delivers value to your customers&#8221; was replaced with &#8220;talking to a whole bunch of bloggers on whatever schedule they feel like keeping&#8221; as the core tenant of building a company. Maybe that&#8217;s <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/web_20_compact_definition.html">the real definition of Web 2.0</a>? The personal network as platform? The blogosphere as platform? Ahhh, yes, it all makes sense now. I was misreading the &#8220;network&#8221; in those definitions as &#8220;Internet&#8221;. Stupid me.</p>

<p>If you have something you as a customer would like to tell <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> about, there&#8217;s a bunch of email addresses on the <a href="http://www.ning.com/about-us.html">About Us</a> page,  the <a href="http://developerdiscussion.ning.com/">Developer Discussion board</a>, an <a href="http://developerdiscussion.ning.com/?action=message&amp;id=274954">IRC channel</a>, and <a href="http://lists.ning.com/mailman/listinfo/developers">a mailing list</a>. We love to hear from you. If you really feel compelled to show up at the office on your own schedule, don&#8217;t be too surprised if I show up at your house unannounced as a &#8220;customer of your blog&#8221; to discuss things with you as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/cgi-bin/blog.cgi/2006/01/30#van_slides">slides from Van Jacobson&#8217;s LCA2006 presentation</a> are online. They talk about an evolution to the Linux networking stack targeted at taking into account multicore systems. If I had to summarize the presentation I would steal the title from slide 16: &#8220;The end of the wire isn&#8217;t the end of the net&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>On a uni-processor it doesn&#8217;t matter, but on a multi-processor the protocol work should be done on the processor that&#8217;s going to consume the data.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means ISR and Softint should do almost nothing and Socket should do everything.</p>

<p>The slides are excellent and lay out the issue very clearly, but I would also recommend checking out <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/cgi-bin/blog.cgi/2006/01/27#vj_channels">DaveM&#8217;s comments on net channels</a>. It was his writeup that turned me on to the presentation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I&#8217;m not at all looking, I keep <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/MikeRowehl.txt">a copy of my resume up online</a>. Why? Because sometimes a recruiter will call and drop a nice nugget of info to you. That&#8217;s exactly what happened this morning. I got a call from a recruiter for <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> looking for Linux programmers. There&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/07/27/netflix-close-to-offering-online-movie-downloads/">speculation going on for a little while about how Netflix will deliver their on demand download service</a>. The recruiter said the project included a team of engineers from ReplayTV, AOL, and Tivo to work on a consumer device. So I looked around on their site, and <a href="http://jobs.netflix.com/DetailFlix.asp?flix1168">here&#8217;s the job listing</a>. So who knows if it&#8217;ll see the light of day, but it would appear that the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118006,00.asp">Tivo/Netflix collaboration that was floating around during 2004</a> is still in process.</p>

Like Gina says, the team is fantastic. Everyone here knows their shit inside and out, including an ops team that I&#8217;ve just simply never seen the equal to before. The egineers are all fantastic. The project is interesting. The area is great (the offices are in downtown Palo Alto, how much ass does that kick?) It&#8217;s got the whole shebang.
If you&#8217;re the kind of person who hops out of bed in the middle of the night sometimes because you think you have a solution to the problem you were working on during the day, we might have a job for you. Drop us a line.</p>
