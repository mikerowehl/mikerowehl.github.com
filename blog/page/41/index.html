  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve started a new app as part of <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">Open Palm Environment</a>. This time it&#8217;s a <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/openpalmenv/db-download/">plugin for pilot-db</a>. <a href="http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/">Pilot-DB</a> is a very popular open source database program for Palm handhelds. It allows the user to create their own databases and fill in the records on their PDA. There are existing databases for all types of information, like yearly wine reviews, state capitals, Internet RFCs, bus schedules, etc. I&#8217;m hoping that if we make it easy for people to create databases with active links, we&#8217;ll end up with databases of <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a> content with links to download the full text, or large databases with open source titles that can be downloaded on demand.</p>

<p>Currently the plugin is just an example that downloads a hardcoded URL and installs whatever it finds there as if it were an app/database. With just a bit of tweaking it&#8217;ll look for a field named &#8220;URL&#8221; in the current record, and use that as the source. I think that providing a plugin for an existing DB product might work out better than the standalone app (palm-torrent) which would also require some proprietary database format of its own. Only time will tell. Something I need to figure out still is how to give good feedback to the user. Most of the Win* functions that palm-torrent uses to draw information about the protocol progress and give installation feedback were causing errors when I used them within the plugin. So if anyone out there has mucked with plugins on the Palm before, in particular pilot-db plugins, please take a look at that and give some info about how to provide a user with progress info.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw the demo at Defcon last summer, apparently now the <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/003202.html">tool for cracking Cisco LEAP</a> has been released. There&#8217;s been a lot of work on replacing WEP in the standard 802.11 stack with a more secure and infrastructure friendly system. Cisco LEAP was one of the contenders, apparently it didn&#8217;t fare too well. However, based on the presentations at Defcon, none of the offerings were doing very well. Tools like <a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a> (for detecting networks) and <a href="http://airsnort.shmoo.com/">AirSnort</a> (for cracking WEP) have been around for a long time. So the existence of tools like this isn&#8217;t really surprizing. The interesting part is that WEP needs to be replaced cause it was insecure, and the replacements have ended up displaying major issues as well. General opinion is that most vendors saw a potential market advantage in being the first mover for implementing a replacement. So all these equiptment vendors raced off to fill the void without performing any sort of diligence, and now they&#8217;re getting spanked in the market cause their replacements are crap. Sure, it&#8217;s hard to get security right. But this time the problem seems to be just pure greed. Everyone jumped in before they were really ready.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brighthand has <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/article/Wi-Fi_Memory_Stick_Review">a review of an 802.11 Memory Stick</a> with drivers for PalmOS 5 devices. That means I should be able to use it with my Clie, very cool. Recently I&#8217;ve been considering getting a new handheld to find out how much use I could get out of WiFi, and this is a nice low cost alternative. It should at least help me figure out from where I can get free or low cost coverage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/002983.html">According to SmartMobs</a> there&#8217;s a fundraiser in San Francisco for a new organization called <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a>. They seem to be into some interesting stuff. This is from their about page on their website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Public Knowledge is a new public-interest advocacy organization dedicated to fortifying and defending a vibrant information commons. This Washington, D.C. based group works with wide spectrum of stakeholders - libraries, educators, scientists, artists, musicians, journalists, consumers, software programmers, civic groups and enlightened businesses - to promote the core conviction that some fundamental democratic principles and cultural values - openness, access, and the capacity to create and compete - must be given new embodiment in the digital age.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m one of them software programmer people, I&#8217;m registered. Maybe I&#8217;ll see some of you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Slashdot linked to the <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/macwarriors/projects/trailblazer/">TrailBlazer</a> project a little while ago. TrailBlazer is a nice visual layout for browser history that should make it easier to get back to a site if you&#8217;ve forgotten to bookmark it. It seems like an excellent idea, but I figured that there would already be a <a href="http://www.mozdev.org/categories/">plugin for Mozilla</a> to provide some sort of enhanced history features. But there isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m actually considering dabbling in Mozilla based development&#8230; maybe this would be a good place to start hacking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Clay Shirky has a <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html">post titled Situated Software</a> available online. There are some excellent general points in there, but I&#8217;m left with a nagging feeling about the piece as a whole. I think there are some aspects which he captures well, but there are other areas which I think are still major hang-ups for the software community as a whole.  Allow me to give an example. I do something I call software prototyping. For some people this makes infinite sense right off the bat, but most say something like &#8220;What do you mean by prototyping? What do you prototype?&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t really matter what I prototype, because prototyping properly done is all about a discovery and exploration process not about particular technologies. In the course of prototyping I end up implementing a lot of small and relatively pointed systems. At one point in the essay Clay says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Businesses routinely ask teams of well-paid people to put hundreds of hours of work creating a single PowerPoint deck that will be looked at in a single meeting. The idea that software should be built for many users, or last for many years, are cultural assumptions not required by the software itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just concentrating on an area that I shouldn&#8217;t be, but I&#8217;ve written applications to be used in EXACTLY the same sense. I&#8217;ve written programs which were meant to be used just for a single presentation. And if that presentation went well the understanding was that the application would be developed out if needed. I&#8217;ve also done plenty of programming on small systems meant to be used by limited groups, like 4 people working on a shared website. I think that the general availability of open source programs has made it very easy to cobble together example applications and simple limited use solutions.</p>

<p>I think these usages have always existed to some degree. And I think that Clay&#8217;s point about the &#8220;that won&#8217;t scale&#8221; argument is well placed. That argument has killed a lot of worthwhile discussion. But there&#8217;s another area, the &#8220;that already exists&#8221; argument of good software engineering. I get crap from experienced programmers all the time because I build applications with an eye toward user needs, and not an eye toward existing implementations. And it is hard to balance these two requirements. Sometimes the right way to deal with a problem is to slightly tweak an existing application, sometimes the problem requires a different outlook altogether. How does one know when they&#8217;re taking the proper approach to servicing a subgroup of users and when they&#8217;re simply &#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221; without justification? I think this is an area that will remain unresolved for a long time. Hopefully the end scarcity that he talks about will spur some reversal of this tyranny of software engineering. I would certainly like to see more engineers in a position where they feel they can experiment with solutions before having to commit. This does require a major ethos change, but I think it would be for the best.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, if you haven&#8217;t seen <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>, which is linked to at the beginning of the post, it&#8217;s a very interesting read. I don&#8217;t think I had run across that before.</p>
