  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jaron Lanier is <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/03/jaron_lanier_up.html">speaking in Palo Alto</a> on Friday April 23rd. The talk is supposed to be an update to <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge74.html">One Half Of A Manifesto</a>, an article written during 2000 in which he examines the beliefs of what he calls &#8220;cybernetic totalism&#8221;. He argues that the belief that Moore&#8217;s law and artificial intelligence will bring about some new class of humanity is just a form of intellectual laziness no more grounded in reality than any other religious dogma. I particularly enjoyed this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Before you tell me that it will be overwhelmingly obvious when the superintelligent new cyber-species arrives, visit a dog show. Or a gathering of people who believe they have been abducted by aliens in UFOs. People are demonstrably insane when it comes to assessing non-human sentience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certainly sounds like an interesting time, especially so because I can&#8217;t really figure out on which side of this debate I lie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris Pirillo has posted a <a href="http://gnomedex.com/updates/2004-04.php#009917">blogroll of Gnomedex 4 attendees</a>. The list is still pretty short (the conf is still a LONG way off :-) but there are already some interesting blogs on there. I even dropped the <a href="http://rpc.blogrolling.com/rss.php?r=01a2b5cd7c11e1a5f86e415f7258b15c">RSS feed version</a> into my Bloglines subscriptions so I can check out the blogs of new people as they join. An excellent way to find people with like interests before we get out there. There&#8217;s supposed to be an open bar the whole time this year. Making a good impression in advance is necessary so as to preemptively counteract the poor impression that stumbling around spewing technoweenie jargon will make.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a <a href="http://www.double.co.nz/scheme/modal-web-server.html">three part article about web programming with Scheme</a> linked off the <a href="http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/">Finding Lisp blog</a>. The articles themselves are very good, and they led me to <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/index.html">Chicken Scheme</a>, an interesting Scheme implementation I was able to get running on my ancient laptop so I could play with something on the plane trip home. It includes what seems to be an interesting <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/manual/manual-Z-H-51.html#%_chap_7">mechanism to support extension</a>, something I haven&#8217;t seen in other implementations yet. Chicken provides a cover script that can be used to create, build, and install extensions called &#8220;eggs&#8221;. Getting the extra modules needed to do web programming was a cinch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s some interesting commentary about the difference between licensing software and purchasing it in <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6710">Why Free Software Matters</a>. It&#8217;s certainly easy to forget just how much of what we do with computers actually ends up having a lot of strings attached. I would like to relate the discussion about licenses and open standards back to the Trusted Computing initiative I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=238">brought up again yesterday</a>. There are a lot of points which people respond to with the example that Sean gives: &#8220;So what? I run MS Word/Windows. It does what I want. Why should I care? They can&#8217;t come into my house and take it away from me. Get that microphone out of my face.&#8221; This is the issue with the TCPA that I have. Under the proposed model, they wouldn&#8217;t have to come into your house to take it away. They would be able to make it so that you couldn&#8217;t use the software unless you were using a set of software that the vendor approves of, and it provides mechanisms so that the vendor can switch the functions of the software and disable it at their will. The model makes it so that the vendor not only can keep your information from you by putting it into a format they don&#8217;t give you the details for, but makes it so that they can cryptographically seal you off from your information. The TCPA model builds into the software provisioning system mechanisms to formalize all these protections. Vendors would no longer have to rely on &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221; in their formats and legal protections of licensing, TCPA would provide them with the tools to enforce their desires using the computer architecture. They&#8217;re techniques that the vendors already try to leverage against us, and blessing the behavior by supporting it explicitly is something I feel would just lead to grosser abuses.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an article titled <a href="http://www.totaltele.com/telcorevolutions/bm5.shtml">Separating network and communications infrastructure</a> up at <a href="http://www.totaltele.com/telcorevolutions/">telco revolutions</a>. I happened across the article during some random wandering, but it sums up exactly how I think about providers. Check this out:</p>

<blockquote><p>Organisations should stop searching for killer applications. Instead, they should seek killer business cases that treat networks as an independent resource that is fundamental to developing value-add as well as open standard communications applications while lowering infrastructure total cost of ownership.</p></blockquote>

<p>Right on. I&#8217;ve said things like that before, but I apply the principles to telcom service providers and not just ITOs. I think the argument extends quite well. It&#8217;s the end-to-end principle applied to business models. Making the nodes of a network smart is not very good for the network itself. It&#8217;s better to keep the internal parts of a network dumb and to put all the logic at the edges. It&#8217;s why I think telecoms trying to &#8220;move up the value chain&#8221; with respect to providing data services is a bad idea.</p>

<time datetime="2004-04-12T05:39:27-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 12<span>th</span>, 2004</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Intel has formally announced the next version of the XScale series of processors <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1565846,00.asp">according to ExtremeTech</a>. There are some cool features in there, it sounds like a good processor. But what really disturbs me is that Intel calls this the &#8220;Wireless Trusted Platform&#8221;, which I think has to mean that it implements <a href="http://www.trustedcomputing.org/home">the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance</a> specifications for Trusted Computing. It only makes sense, Intel is a founding member of that organization. I&#8217;m not a big fan of trusted computing the way it has been proposed. Sure, there are lots of good applications it could be used for. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://invisiblog.com/1c801df4aee49232/article/0df117d5d9b32aea8bc23194ecc270ec">anonymous blog called Unlimited Freedom</a> (<a href="http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:-TKIk_sivx8J:invisiblog.com/1c801df4aee49232/article/0df117d5d9b32aea8bc23194ecc270ec&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google Cache</a>) which gives some of the beneficial applications that could be built on top of TCPA recommendations. But I think the technology would be used to limit the freedoms of consumers more than it would be used to provide new applications. That&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t think a trusted computing effort wouldn&#8217;t be a welcome addition to the technology menagerie that is the current Internet. I just think that the suggested architecture skews too heavily toward protecting content providers without much consideration for consumer rights. And as <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lessig comments with more eloquence than I</a>, content producers already have a lot of legal protections on their side. Do they really need more mechanism and code protections?</p>

<p>There are some sites opposing the TCPA as well, such as <a href="http://www.againsttcpa.com/">AgainstTCPA.com</a>. I was able to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=130">attend the class on Trusted Computing by Seth Schoen</a> back in January. I think this is an issue that everyone should be educated about, although I have no good option to present for how to do it. Even if you don&#8217;t agree with me, please, go and read some of the info from either side of the debate. Educated people are usually harder to fool. Even if this gets used widely and ends up being an issue, perhaps an educated public will prevent it from being abused too badly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve started a new app as part of <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">Open Palm Environment</a>. This time it&#8217;s a <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/openpalmenv/db-download/">plugin for pilot-db</a>. <a href="http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/">Pilot-DB</a> is a very popular open source database program for Palm handhelds. It allows the user to create their own databases and fill in the records on their PDA. There are existing databases for all types of information, like yearly wine reviews, state capitals, Internet RFCs, bus schedules, etc. I&#8217;m hoping that if we make it easy for people to create databases with active links, we&#8217;ll end up with databases of <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a> content with links to download the full text, or large databases with open source titles that can be downloaded on demand.</p>

<p>Currently the plugin is just an example that downloads a hardcoded URL and installs whatever it finds there as if it were an app/database. With just a bit of tweaking it&#8217;ll look for a field named &#8220;URL&#8221; in the current record, and use that as the source. I think that providing a plugin for an existing DB product might work out better than the standalone app (palm-torrent) which would also require some proprietary database format of its own. Only time will tell. Something I need to figure out still is how to give good feedback to the user. Most of the Win* functions that palm-torrent uses to draw information about the protocol progress and give installation feedback were causing errors when I used them within the plugin. So if anyone out there has mucked with plugins on the Palm before, in particular pilot-db plugins, please take a look at that and give some info about how to provide a user with progress info.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw the demo at Defcon last summer, apparently now the <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/003202.html">tool for cracking Cisco LEAP</a> has been released. There&#8217;s been a lot of work on replacing WEP in the standard 802.11 stack with a more secure and infrastructure friendly system. Cisco LEAP was one of the contenders, apparently it didn&#8217;t fare too well. However, based on the presentations at Defcon, none of the offerings were doing very well. Tools like <a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a> (for detecting networks) and <a href="http://airsnort.shmoo.com/">AirSnort</a> (for cracking WEP) have been around for a long time. So the existence of tools like this isn&#8217;t really surprizing. The interesting part is that WEP needs to be replaced cause it was insecure, and the replacements have ended up displaying major issues as well. General opinion is that most vendors saw a potential market advantage in being the first mover for implementing a replacement. So all these equiptment vendors raced off to fill the void without performing any sort of diligence, and now they&#8217;re getting spanked in the market cause their replacements are crap. Sure, it&#8217;s hard to get security right. But this time the problem seems to be just pure greed. Everyone jumped in before they were really ready.</p>
