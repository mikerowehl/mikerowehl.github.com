  <div class="entry-content"><p>We now have Oren Michels in the trenches with us at Feedster!! I&#8217;m really excited about it cause hopefully it means I&#8217;ll have more time to get down and dirty in the code. I&#8217;ll be working on some of the projects that we didn&#8217;t have enough hacker-hours available for before (which is really what I&#8217;m best at anyway) as well as continuing to service the external relationships I&#8217;m already engaged in. Oren has joined as the Vice President of Engineering, so he&#8217;ll be taking over the higher level stuff.  Stuff that I simply didn&#8217;t have the skills to do, and that those who did didn&#8217;t have the time to do. Oren has been around the block a few times, and I&#8217;m sure that working for him will be as educational as it will be rewarding. Welcome aboard Oren!</p>

<p>So what is some of this stuff that I&#8217;ll be working on? There&#8217;s still some front end work to be done, some of which requires some QA and feedback from you out there in the blogosphere. For example, we&#8217;ve fixed up the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/tutorials/claimfeed/">feed claiming</a> to fix some bugs, but we&#8217;re not sure yet if we&#8217;ve squashed all of them. So if you&#8217;ve tried to claim your feed before and ran in to problems, please give it another try. If you have some issues with it email me at miker at feedster dot com and I&#8217;ll do my best to help you out. Some information that would really help out in getting problems taken care of quickly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your Feedster login (name only, don&#8217;t include your password)</p></li>
<li><p>The URL for the feed you&#8217;re trying to claim</p></li>
<li><p>What blogging software you&#8217;re using</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been running around quite a bit, and haven&#8217;t posted about a bunch of things that I wanted to. There are a few things I want to at least throw out there though. The first is that I want to point people toward the <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/archives/2005/03/feedster_corpor.html">post that Rafer put up</a> about <a href="http://steveshu.typepad.com/steve_shus_weblog/2005/03/perspectives_on.html">the common interpretation</a> of the <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/03/corporate_blogg.html">Feedster reaction</a> to the still-ongoing <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/03/whose_voice_is.html">issues that Niall had with one of his blog posts</a>. I just want to point it out here as well, cause I think the reaction was misinterpreted by many. As for my own reaction to the issue, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=440">already posted about why I think the policy is important</a>. On the overall issues I have to admit that I have a reaction somewhat like what <a href="http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/03/09/niall_kennedy_and_the_spectre_of_being_dooced.php">Stowe Boyd expresses</a>. There is a dangerous precedent at work here, and it&#8217;s not the kind of thing that one person can fight alone. Corporate culture encourages an environment which is really pretty unhealthy as a whole. How do we attempt to change that environment without forcing some people to martyr themselves for the cause? How do we do so without the companies those people work at also having to martyr themselves? Because there definitely was risk to Technorati as well, they&#8217;re judged by some rather unhealthy standards by the rest of the business environment. This is a sea change move to try to uninstall a widespread and flawed set of social norms. I have no idea how one would go about trying to do it. But I do know that Niall is an exceptional person to know in the real world, and it would be unfortunate if he were only able to partially express himself online for fear of negatively reflecting on his employer.</p>

<p>By the way, I&#8217;ve added a disclaimer to the header of my HTML pages. Those of you reading this as a feed won&#8217;t see that.  So to cover my own ass in RSS as well I&#8217;ll restate it thusly: &#8220;The views expressed on this weblog are mine alone. Mine! Not yours! They do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/03/whose_voice_is.html">issues that Niall Kennedy has had regarding this blog postings</a> definitely surprised me. I didn&#8217;t expect Technorati to have the reaction to the postings that it did, even if there was some flack from those companies and projects pictured in the image Niall posted (which by the way I liked two days ago, and am now considering getting made into a full size poster given the effect that it had - I consider the current conversation evidence that his image was good art). I would have expected the reaction by Technorati to be something more like telling the responding companies &#8220;Hey, Niall just works here, we don&#8217;t own him.  If you have issue with what he said please direct your comments to him.&#8221;  Seems perfectly rational to me. For some additional commentary and a great running timeline of how it went down check out <a href="http://www.buzzhit.com/2005/03/technorati-gags-community-managers.html">Tony Gentile&#8217;s post</a>.</p>

<p>But no matter what side my personal opinion might lie, I think the episode just underscores the need for <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=369">blogging policy to be stated up front by corporations</a>. <a href="http://www.reasonableman.com/">Charles Smith</a> from <a href="http://www.pheedo.com">Pheedo</a> gave a presentation at the <a href="http://www.ebig.org/sig/sig.aspx?SIGid=36">eBig RSS SIG</a> about the need for corporations to lay down their policy up front with respect to blogging by employees. If this kind off issue can happen at Technorati it can happen anywhere. Where you draw the line as a corporation is completely up to you, but it&#8217;s only fair to lay down the rules in advance so that no one is caught off guard. Feedster has a <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/corporate_policies/index.html">blogging policy</a>, and we&#8217;ve put it up online for those who want something to start with for their own policy. Everyone should have one, particularly those with employees who would like to carry on conversations online but may be afraid to do so unless specifically permitted.</p>

<p>Of course, these views about the issue, artistic leanings, and recommendations are entirely my own, and have nothing to do with Feedster at all. Even though they&#8217;re in the Feedster category of my blog. Trust me, they just don&#8217;t. This also isn&#8217;t legal advice.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.symbiandiaries.com/ewan/">Ewan Spence</a> (who I know from #mobitopia on irc.freenode.net) has started a new podcast called <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/mobiles/">The Mobiles Show</a>. The interviews are great, the information is timely and well delivered, I&#8217;ve definitely  found a new show to add to my subscriptions! Thanks for the excellent info Ewan, I&#8217;m looking forward to more of it. There are two episodes up right now, and the first was recorded completely on a mobile device. Definitely interesting. Given all the discussion that was going on a while ago about mobile recording kit I think there would be a lot of interest in a system that allowed people to record simple bits and pieces and upload them right away. Think about the soundseeing tours that Adam Curry did, around that time there was a lot of discussion about how to create podcasts while walking around or commuting or otherwise engaged in some other activity. A simple audio production tool for a handset (and this could be as simple as a start/stop recorder with the ability to clip out bits of audio) together with services like <a href="http://www.audioblog.com/">Audioblog</a> could be pretty compelling for that group of users. Personally, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about <a href="http://www.videoblogging.info/">video</a> in addition to that audio, and how to get handsets doing that bit well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an excellent bit of commentary about innovation and the end to end design principle of interconnected networks in the audio from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail349.html">Larry Lessig at the SDForum Distinguished Speaker series</a>. Here&#8217;s a quote that really stuck out for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>We want a simple network and smart applications that run this network. The consequence of this design, which was selected solely because it allowed innovation without coordination among the network owners. The consequence of this design is to produce something like a neutral network. A network that can not know and therefor can not discriminate among applications that are placed on this network. So long as the applications going through the transport layer obey the standard protocols that the internet and physical layer need to facilitate communication it will run on this network. And you need no permission of the network owner. So this architecture guarantees that outsiders always have the right to innovate in this particular space. They have the right to innovate equally. Innovate equally here means that they have the right to innovate in something held in common. The right to innovate is held in common, and it&#8217;s that we should think of as the innovation common. Innovation common here is the right that people hold equally in the context of an end to end network to build applications and services for that network. That right is guaranteed by an architectural design and it inspires because of it&#8217;s egalitarian character an extraordinary range of innovation which otherwise would not occur.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what the mobile network providers aren&#8217;t doing. I&#8217;ve made comments about this kind of thing before (<a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=239">Separating Infrastructure</a>, <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=275">Mobile Data Services and Innovation</a>, and <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=385">Reopening Mobile and Open</a>). This kind of issue is the reason why people cite 802.11 and meshes of local area networking technologies as competitive with cellular. It has NOTHING to do with technology. Stop making technology arguments against it. So what if it&#8217;s not available everywhere, and it can&#8217;t do handoff, and it doesn&#8217;t tie into the voice network. That does not matter for the core argument. Because the unlicensed technologies are nondiscriminatory and interconnected with the Internet (big I), applications and services which address those shortcomings can be developed by anyone. Just like any disruptive innovation, the <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/040101/disruption.html">disruptive technology almost always takes root in a very undemanding application</a>. Wireless LAN technologies will be disruptive to cellular unless the cellular providers take steps to make their network innovation friendly. There might be a short term win for cellular providers in having the integrated stack. But once the technology is mature enough the game changes. The temporary win of the integrated play is just that of an immature industry. Here, this is from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail135.html">Clayton Christensen in Capturing the Upside</a> (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/transcripts/135/transcript-print135-1.html">transcript</a>) which describes a rough parallel from the PC industry:</p>

<blockquote><p>So here the rough stages of value added in the computer industry, and during the first two decades, it was essentially dominated by vertically integrated companies because they had to be integrated given the way you had to compete at the time.  We could actually insert right in here “Apple Computer.”  (Let me go back to the prior slide.)  Do you remember in the early years of the PC industry Apple with its proprietary architecture?  Those Macs were so much better than the IBM’s.  They were so much more convenient to use, they rarely crashed, and the IBM’s were kludgy machines that crashed a lot, because in a sense, that open architecture was prematurely modular.</p></blockquote>

<p>But then as the functionality got more than good enough, then there was scope, and you could back off of the frontier of what was technologically possible, and the PC industry flipped to a modular architecture.  And the vendor of the proprietary system, Apple continues probably to make the neatest computers in the world, but they become a niche player because as the industry disintegrates like this, it’s kind of like you ran the whole industry through a baloney slicer, and it became dominated by a horizontally stratified population of independent companies who could work together at arm’s length interfacing by industry standards.</p>

<p>The integration of the mobile industry is essential at this point because the services mostly suck. They&#8217;re not good enough yet, and even the best of services leave the average user confounded and the expert user livid. But once the services are able to fulfill a level of capability that surpasses the average users basic needs, the value shifts out of the basic infrastructure. If the next generation of networks is approaching as rapidly as the folks at CTIA would have us believe, that day should be coming soon. It&#8217;s a tipping point too, once the infrastructure fulfills base requirements users come flooding in and stepping up the demand for associated services. Services at this scope can&#8217;t be delivered in a walled garden. This can&#8217;t be a top down, the industry needs to be allowed to disintegrate to provide the ability to fulfill on the services that the infrastructure enables.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The announcement for the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/02/march-mobile-monday.html">March Mobile Monday is up</a>. The topic this time is Mobile Gaming, inspired in large part by the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com">Game Developers Conference</a> being in town at the same time. We&#8217;re going to be over at <a href="http://www.dimension7.com">Dimension7</a> again, cause that&#8217;s right down Folsom from Moscone and should be convenient for all the conference goers.  Here&#8217;s the essential info:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What: March Mobile Monday (Mobile Gaming)</p></li>
<li><p>When: March 7th, 2005 7:00pm</p></li>
<li><p>Where: Dimension7 (150 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA)</p></li>
<li><p>Who: Anyone interested in mobility</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: Nothing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The Mobile Monday events have been going really well, and I expect this one to keep up the trend of steady significant growth. Given that the montly events are going so well, we&#8217;ve been thinking about doing something on a grander scale. Something more like a conference than an evening event. Say a day long conference with multiple speakers, where we can give a speaking spot to some of the people we can&#8217;t fit into these smaller events as well as get prepared for the larger audience some of the more well known personalities are sure to draw. We&#8217;re just getting together some early stage plans now, but as always we&#8217;re looking for whatever help we can find. Just like the evening events, I would like the whole conf to be free to attendees. That could be hard to setup, but if <a href="http://www.bloggercon.com/">BloggerCon</a> can do it I think we can as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a few minutes ago <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/">Fagan</a> popped up on IM and said &#8220;http://geourl.org/ back up.&#8221;  Woohoo!!!! Music to my ears.  <a href="http://www.geourl.com">GeoURL</a> is a service that keeps track of physical locations to go along with web resources. So thanks to GeoURL you can see <a href="http://geourl.org/near?p=http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">web resources near me in the real world</a>. Apparently <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2005/02/25/001178.html">Ask Bjoern Hansen is responsible for the resurrection</a>. Thanks Ask! Of course, being the mobility wonk that I am, I would love a neighbors lookup function based on coordinates rather than existing resources. Tie something like <a href="http://www.tagsurf.com">TagSurf</a> (which allows tagging based on URLs) into the GeoURL lookup. Pull your GPS coords, find URLs of nearby sources, use URLs to pull comments out of Tagsurf. All we need is a layer of FOAF filtering on those results and we&#8217;ve got a decent componentized recommendation system. And I think everyone knows how much Mike hates the silo. Multiple services, acting together, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

<p>Update: I parsed Ask Bjoern Hansen as Ask &#8220;Bjoern Hansen&#8221;, and that&#8217;s not what it is at all. It&#8217;s Ask Bjoern Hansen all as one, his first name is Ask.  Ooops, sorry Ask! Thanks for the correction Fagan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris pointed me to an interview today, and I downloaded the MP3 and tossed it onto my Shuffle almost without thinking about it. Why was I able to do this action naturally and in the manner I choose?  Without switching off my main desktop machine?  Because the 0.98rc1 release of <a href="http://www.blinkenlights.ch/cgi-bin/fm.pl?get=ipode">GNUpod</a> includes the necessary changes to support the iPod Shuffle. It was crippled for a while, and I had to use this attrocious bag of drivers misnamed an operating system in order to do so. But now I can download audio when I want and put them on my device using the programs I choose to. Yay! Thank you GNUpod authors, you rock!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://106miles.blogspot.com/2005/02/march-106-announcement.html">March meeting of 106miles</a> has been announced. The guest is Jeff Winner, former VP of Engineering at Friendster and current principal in venture accelerator Alacrity Partners, the topic is &#8220;Fundamentals of Financing for Founders: the current funding climate in Silicon Valley&#8221;. The <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=419">last meeting was fantastic</a>, definitely check it out if you get a chance.  They need to make sure they capacity plan correctly, so if you&#8217;re planning to come email jpark at commerce.net.  I&#8217;m not putting the location in here so that people don&#8217;t just show up, like they do with the <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/">Future Salon</a> events. But I will tell you it&#8217;s on March 9th at 7:00pm and on the peninsula.</p>
