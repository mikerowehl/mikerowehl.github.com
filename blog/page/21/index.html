  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook">Russ</a> and I are going to be <a href="http://106miles.blogspot.com/2005/03/april-106-topic.html">presenting at 106Miles in April</a>. The topic is &#8220;Every Business Needs a Mobile Strategy&#8221;, and as much as possible I would like to encourage discussion on this one. So lets start out beforehand and figure out what topics we want to hit when we get together at the meeting. Russ and I have been running <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a> meetings here in the Bay Area, and the response has been simply fantastic. One of the most well respected conferences that I know of, <a href="http://www.demo.com/demofall/">DEMO</a>, merged the mobile and main tracks of their conference because it seems like the two are now inseparable:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the six years of DEMOmobile, wireless technology has advanced the digital lifestyle and become an integral part of most every aspect of computing. That is why, starting this year, DEMOmobile becomes DEMOfall. Join industry leaders during 2 days of ground-breaking presentations, where we&#8217;ll explore wireless innovations in the context of broader technology markets.</p></blockquote>

<p>But still there are <a href="http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/Feb2005/1055.htm">voices shouting caution just as loudly</a>, even from within the industry:</p>

<blockquote><p>The myth of mobile maturity: T-Mobile denounced the notion of maturity, even in voice services. Global mobile users are forecast to double from 1 billion at Cannes last year to 2 billion by end 2005. US customer growth was around 14% last year. (T-Mobile USA customers increased 32%). In European countries, penetration is moving beyond 100%. More important, uses and usage of mobile are immature everywhere, and mobile is just now entering the broadband revolution.</p></blockquote>

<p>At a startup company, risk and uncertainly are constant companions. Conflicting reports of what needs to be done are certainly nothing new, but how can a startup company use this particular situation to best advantage?</p>

<p>As has been learned painfully and repeatedly over the past few years, having a mobile strategy does not mean just figuring out how to slap a WAP or XHTML front end onto whatever your application is. The mobile experience is a <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/2005/01/taking-my-desktop-everywhere-you-can.html">fundamentally different experience than the desktop</a>. One example of the difference is that most people use their mobiles in short bursts during the day, to fill up small chunks of time standing in line or waiting for a train or bus. It&#8217;s a much less immersive experience than sitting down in front of a desktop system for a long stretch of work. Another is that their mobile device is an intensely personal device for many. Their PC might be provided by their employer at the office, or shared by the family at home, but in general their mobile handset is their own. The opportunity to personalize is of much greater interest than many expected, just take a look at the <a href="http://www.textually.org/ringtonia/">thriving ringtone market</a>. I&#8217;m quite the mobile booster normally, but I wouldn&#8217;t have pegged that market as a winner until I saw it happen.</p>

<p>The rules in the area are still being learned, and startup companies are in the position to grow their services in a way that meshes with the new interaction modes instead of simply allowing for them. I would like to know the particular questions that people have about mobility, and where should Russ and I start? Do you want an overview of the technologies (Symbian vs. Palm vs. Brew vs. J2ME)? Delivering an application via WAP/XHTML compared to delivering a native application? Or more of the general overall issues like I described above? The intrinsic differences between mobile and online usage? Different application architectures enabled by mobility (use of asyncronous notifications, location based applications)?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> has been helping out with the <a href="http://workerbeesblog.blogspot.com/2005/03/now-cat-can-really-be-let-out-of-bag.html">Bloghercon effort</a> that <a href="http://workerbeesblog.blogspot.com/">Elisa</a> has bee driving. I wasn&#8217;t sure if they wanted to make info about the effort public yet, but apparently is was announced this past week and <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=bloghercon&amp;sort=date">discussion is underway</a>. They&#8217;re not sure yet if men will be welcome at the session yet, which I admit I don&#8217;t agree with. But I do agree with a lot of the stuff that <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2005/03/blogihericon_co.html">Charlene says</a> about the effort. Although I can come up with a dozen or so women who blog faster than I can say them normally, a lot of the other points in there I agree with. Jessica Baumgart recently <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jkbaumga/2005/03/11#a3227">posted some points as well</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my story about getting noticed from just about a year ago. For about 3 years I was working for a company in Palo Alto doing Linux embedded systems work. We did some pretty hardcore stuff, and I learned a ton in the process. When it was time to move on I felt that I had a really strong set of skills, and that now that I was in Silicon Valley and had learned a ton about working at and with a startup company, that I was ready to strike off on my own and do some consulting for a while. I wanted to get exposed to a whole bunch of new ideas floating around in the environment, and I figured that a boatload of technical ability could just cary me around to all the places I wanted to go. I was wrong, no one came around beating a path to my door to hand over a part of the project they were working on. Eventually, after a whole bunch of painful arguments and me not understanding why no one was paying attention to the things I was saying, Elle eventually showed me what I needed to do to get tied into the environment I needed to be a part of. And amazingly enough it had nothing to do with knowing how to write a plugin for a dynamically typed interpreted language or how to capture snapshots of serial interfaces for debugging. There is a group of people for whom that kind of cred opens doors, but I had &#8220;shifted my audience&#8221; so to speak, and I needed to learn how to talk to them. And all the yelling in the world, no matter how valid it might have been, would have gotten the attention of the people I wanted attention from. It&#8217;s a common mistake apparently, and one that geeks make all the time. I ran headlong into it, I admit it. But it&#8217;s not only a mistake that geeks make, it&#8217;s a problem general  to shifting communities. The techniques and models that work in one area don&#8217;t work in another. Sometimes the right thing to do is to change the way things work, sometimes the right thing to do is adapt personally. Sometimes the right thing lies somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>So my question to the Bloghercon folks would first be are you looking to get noticed by the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/live/top100.html">Technorati 100</a>? Because that&#8217;s going to take a much different strategy than trying to form an alternate network more friendly to the interactions of women within the blogging community. If you&#8217;re looking to change the way that things are done, make sure that you include some of the people making the tools.  The tools in part shape the way you can interact, and part of the reason the link reigns supreme in this environment is because all the tools are made to respect them. It&#8217;s not like you have to <a href="http://mena.typepad.com/about.html">look far</a> for a woman very unfluential in the way that blogging tools are made. If you want some woman to talk about online communities where female participants have enjoyed as much success as the men, the <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/10/11/the_gender_profile_of_wikipedia.html">Wikipedia</a> is a great place to start. I would also personally recommend <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/">Anita Wilhelm</a>, <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a>, and <a href="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/">Betsy Devine</a>. And I would love to attend, if I&#8217;m allowed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t finished the test, the tags in my posts don&#8217;t seem to be getting picked up by Technorati right now for some reason, but I just posted the source to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/tag.php.txt">a simple redirect script</a> to use when tagging. There&#8217;s some <a href="http://uncorked.wachob.com/node/38">concern over linking to Technorati with each tag</a>. Technorati knows this, and allows the tag URLs to point anywhere and they still process them. The problem is that then your tag links don&#8217;t really point anywhere useful. So what about pointing the URLs at yourself? I have that tag.php script sitting on my site so that I can link to something like <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/tag.php/entertainment">http://www.bitsplitter.net/tag.php/entertainment</a>. Technorati should pick up the end part of that URL and index the post. But I control the redirect, so that I can change it should I want people clicking on my link to go somewhere else in the future. I also made the tags potentially multileveled, so that I could toss in a link like <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/tag.php/photo/106miles">http://www.bitsplitter.net/tag.php/photo/106miles</a> and it&#8217;ll go to a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/106miles">photo page at Flickr</a> instead of <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/106miles">Technorati tag summary page</a>. Of course it&#8217;s a pain in the ass to have to deal with this now, but say <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> eventually grows this function (and eventually other publishing engines, it just starts with Wordpress cause that&#8217;s what rocks the most). Redirect as a standard function, admin interface to redirect locations, and editing tools that allow tagging posts without having to manually enter HTML - that could be dealable I think. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">link to the basics about Technorati tags</a> for those who have no idea what I&#8217;m on about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We now have Oren Michels in the trenches with us at Feedster!! I&#8217;m really excited about it cause hopefully it means I&#8217;ll have more time to get down and dirty in the code. I&#8217;ll be working on some of the projects that we didn&#8217;t have enough hacker-hours available for before (which is really what I&#8217;m best at anyway) as well as continuing to service the external relationships I&#8217;m already engaged in. Oren has joined as the Vice President of Engineering, so he&#8217;ll be taking over the higher level stuff.  Stuff that I simply didn&#8217;t have the skills to do, and that those who did didn&#8217;t have the time to do. Oren has been around the block a few times, and I&#8217;m sure that working for him will be as educational as it will be rewarding. Welcome aboard Oren!</p>

<p>So what is some of this stuff that I&#8217;ll be working on? There&#8217;s still some front end work to be done, some of which requires some QA and feedback from you out there in the blogosphere. For example, we&#8217;ve fixed up the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/tutorials/claimfeed/">feed claiming</a> to fix some bugs, but we&#8217;re not sure yet if we&#8217;ve squashed all of them. So if you&#8217;ve tried to claim your feed before and ran in to problems, please give it another try. If you have some issues with it email me at miker at feedster dot com and I&#8217;ll do my best to help you out. Some information that would really help out in getting problems taken care of quickly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your Feedster login (name only, don&#8217;t include your password)</p></li>
<li><p>The URL for the feed you&#8217;re trying to claim</p></li>
<li><p>What blogging software you&#8217;re using</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been running around quite a bit, and haven&#8217;t posted about a bunch of things that I wanted to. There are a few things I want to at least throw out there though. The first is that I want to point people toward the <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/archives/2005/03/feedster_corpor.html">post that Rafer put up</a> about <a href="http://steveshu.typepad.com/steve_shus_weblog/2005/03/perspectives_on.html">the common interpretation</a> of the <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/03/corporate_blogg.html">Feedster reaction</a> to the still-ongoing <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/03/whose_voice_is.html">issues that Niall had with one of his blog posts</a>. I just want to point it out here as well, cause I think the reaction was misinterpreted by many. As for my own reaction to the issue, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=440">already posted about why I think the policy is important</a>. On the overall issues I have to admit that I have a reaction somewhat like what <a href="http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/03/09/niall_kennedy_and_the_spectre_of_being_dooced.php">Stowe Boyd expresses</a>. There is a dangerous precedent at work here, and it&#8217;s not the kind of thing that one person can fight alone. Corporate culture encourages an environment which is really pretty unhealthy as a whole. How do we attempt to change that environment without forcing some people to martyr themselves for the cause? How do we do so without the companies those people work at also having to martyr themselves? Because there definitely was risk to Technorati as well, they&#8217;re judged by some rather unhealthy standards by the rest of the business environment. This is a sea change move to try to uninstall a widespread and flawed set of social norms. I have no idea how one would go about trying to do it. But I do know that Niall is an exceptional person to know in the real world, and it would be unfortunate if he were only able to partially express himself online for fear of negatively reflecting on his employer.</p>

<p>By the way, I&#8217;ve added a disclaimer to the header of my HTML pages. Those of you reading this as a feed won&#8217;t see that.  So to cover my own ass in RSS as well I&#8217;ll restate it thusly: &#8220;The views expressed on this weblog are mine alone. Mine! Not yours! They do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/03/whose_voice_is.html">issues that Niall Kennedy has had regarding this blog postings</a> definitely surprised me. I didn&#8217;t expect Technorati to have the reaction to the postings that it did, even if there was some flack from those companies and projects pictured in the image Niall posted (which by the way I liked two days ago, and am now considering getting made into a full size poster given the effect that it had - I consider the current conversation evidence that his image was good art). I would have expected the reaction by Technorati to be something more like telling the responding companies &#8220;Hey, Niall just works here, we don&#8217;t own him.  If you have issue with what he said please direct your comments to him.&#8221;  Seems perfectly rational to me. For some additional commentary and a great running timeline of how it went down check out <a href="http://www.buzzhit.com/2005/03/technorati-gags-community-managers.html">Tony Gentile&#8217;s post</a>.</p>

<p>But no matter what side my personal opinion might lie, I think the episode just underscores the need for <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=369">blogging policy to be stated up front by corporations</a>. <a href="http://www.reasonableman.com/">Charles Smith</a> from <a href="http://www.pheedo.com">Pheedo</a> gave a presentation at the <a href="http://www.ebig.org/sig/sig.aspx?SIGid=36">eBig RSS SIG</a> about the need for corporations to lay down their policy up front with respect to blogging by employees. If this kind off issue can happen at Technorati it can happen anywhere. Where you draw the line as a corporation is completely up to you, but it&#8217;s only fair to lay down the rules in advance so that no one is caught off guard. Feedster has a <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/corporate_policies/index.html">blogging policy</a>, and we&#8217;ve put it up online for those who want something to start with for their own policy. Everyone should have one, particularly those with employees who would like to carry on conversations online but may be afraid to do so unless specifically permitted.</p>

<p>Of course, these views about the issue, artistic leanings, and recommendations are entirely my own, and have nothing to do with Feedster at all. Even though they&#8217;re in the Feedster category of my blog. Trust me, they just don&#8217;t. This also isn&#8217;t legal advice.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.symbiandiaries.com/ewan/">Ewan Spence</a> (who I know from #mobitopia on irc.freenode.net) has started a new podcast called <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/mobiles/">The Mobiles Show</a>. The interviews are great, the information is timely and well delivered, I&#8217;ve definitely  found a new show to add to my subscriptions! Thanks for the excellent info Ewan, I&#8217;m looking forward to more of it. There are two episodes up right now, and the first was recorded completely on a mobile device. Definitely interesting. Given all the discussion that was going on a while ago about mobile recording kit I think there would be a lot of interest in a system that allowed people to record simple bits and pieces and upload them right away. Think about the soundseeing tours that Adam Curry did, around that time there was a lot of discussion about how to create podcasts while walking around or commuting or otherwise engaged in some other activity. A simple audio production tool for a handset (and this could be as simple as a start/stop recorder with the ability to clip out bits of audio) together with services like <a href="http://www.audioblog.com/">Audioblog</a> could be pretty compelling for that group of users. Personally, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about <a href="http://www.videoblogging.info/">video</a> in addition to that audio, and how to get handsets doing that bit well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an excellent bit of commentary about innovation and the end to end design principle of interconnected networks in the audio from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail349.html">Larry Lessig at the SDForum Distinguished Speaker series</a>. Here&#8217;s a quote that really stuck out for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>We want a simple network and smart applications that run this network. The consequence of this design, which was selected solely because it allowed innovation without coordination among the network owners. The consequence of this design is to produce something like a neutral network. A network that can not know and therefor can not discriminate among applications that are placed on this network. So long as the applications going through the transport layer obey the standard protocols that the internet and physical layer need to facilitate communication it will run on this network. And you need no permission of the network owner. So this architecture guarantees that outsiders always have the right to innovate in this particular space. They have the right to innovate equally. Innovate equally here means that they have the right to innovate in something held in common. The right to innovate is held in common, and it&#8217;s that we should think of as the innovation common. Innovation common here is the right that people hold equally in the context of an end to end network to build applications and services for that network. That right is guaranteed by an architectural design and it inspires because of it&#8217;s egalitarian character an extraordinary range of innovation which otherwise would not occur.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what the mobile network providers aren&#8217;t doing. I&#8217;ve made comments about this kind of thing before (<a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=239">Separating Infrastructure</a>, <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=275">Mobile Data Services and Innovation</a>, and <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=385">Reopening Mobile and Open</a>). This kind of issue is the reason why people cite 802.11 and meshes of local area networking technologies as competitive with cellular. It has NOTHING to do with technology. Stop making technology arguments against it. So what if it&#8217;s not available everywhere, and it can&#8217;t do handoff, and it doesn&#8217;t tie into the voice network. That does not matter for the core argument. Because the unlicensed technologies are nondiscriminatory and interconnected with the Internet (big I), applications and services which address those shortcomings can be developed by anyone. Just like any disruptive innovation, the <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/040101/disruption.html">disruptive technology almost always takes root in a very undemanding application</a>. Wireless LAN technologies will be disruptive to cellular unless the cellular providers take steps to make their network innovation friendly. There might be a short term win for cellular providers in having the integrated stack. But once the technology is mature enough the game changes. The temporary win of the integrated play is just that of an immature industry. Here, this is from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail135.html">Clayton Christensen in Capturing the Upside</a> (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/transcripts/135/transcript-print135-1.html">transcript</a>) which describes a rough parallel from the PC industry:</p>

<blockquote><p>So here the rough stages of value added in the computer industry, and during the first two decades, it was essentially dominated by vertically integrated companies because they had to be integrated given the way you had to compete at the time.  We could actually insert right in here “Apple Computer.”  (Let me go back to the prior slide.)  Do you remember in the early years of the PC industry Apple with its proprietary architecture?  Those Macs were so much better than the IBM’s.  They were so much more convenient to use, they rarely crashed, and the IBM’s were kludgy machines that crashed a lot, because in a sense, that open architecture was prematurely modular.</p></blockquote>

<p>But then as the functionality got more than good enough, then there was scope, and you could back off of the frontier of what was technologically possible, and the PC industry flipped to a modular architecture.  And the vendor of the proprietary system, Apple continues probably to make the neatest computers in the world, but they become a niche player because as the industry disintegrates like this, it’s kind of like you ran the whole industry through a baloney slicer, and it became dominated by a horizontally stratified population of independent companies who could work together at arm’s length interfacing by industry standards.</p>

<p>The integration of the mobile industry is essential at this point because the services mostly suck. They&#8217;re not good enough yet, and even the best of services leave the average user confounded and the expert user livid. But once the services are able to fulfill a level of capability that surpasses the average users basic needs, the value shifts out of the basic infrastructure. If the next generation of networks is approaching as rapidly as the folks at CTIA would have us believe, that day should be coming soon. It&#8217;s a tipping point too, once the infrastructure fulfills base requirements users come flooding in and stepping up the demand for associated services. Services at this scope can&#8217;t be delivered in a walled garden. This can&#8217;t be a top down, the industry needs to be allowed to disintegrate to provide the ability to fulfill on the services that the infrastructure enables.</p>
