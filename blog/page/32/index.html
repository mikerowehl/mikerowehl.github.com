  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/000525.html">post over at Future Now</a> with a pointer to a new paper titled <a href="http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/SR-869_Infrastructure_New_Geog.pdf">Infrastructure for the New Geography</a> (PDF). I think it does a great job of laying down some of the possible benefits of having geographic data available. Not just being able to include information about where a photo was taken when you upload it to your album, but having a general geographic search engine that operates in the way that Google or Yahoo do for text content. Sorry for the short post, but I didn&#8217;t want to let this one slip by, it&#8217;s definitely worth the time. Go read it. NOW! Git goin&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org">Bay Area Mobility Forum</a> has been going pretty well, but there hasn&#8217;t been all that much feedback or much ongoing discussion on the blog.  So I setup a new <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> for it. For those who haven&#8217;t used it before, the Wireless Ink folks have a site where you can go and create your own website, with the major differentiator being that the site works via just about every mobile browser in a  phone or PDA. They also have an emulator so that you can use the sites from a normal desktop browser. To launch the desktop version just <a href="javascript:void(0">click here</a>;) and the site should come up in a popup. Alternatively you can enter winksite.com/mikerowehl/bamf in your wap/xhtml browser to bring up the site from a mobile device. Through the site you can get to the syndicated feed from the mobilityforum.org blog, syndicated version of other mobile  related feeds, links to mobile sites, guestbook, post notes, and a chat area. I have no idea how it&#8217;ll work out. I figure that if most of you are interested in mobility, you normally have some kind of browser with you and you&#8217;re looking to use it. So maybe we can capture some of those extra minutes here and there and get some other online forms of communication going.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bill brought up some excellent topics at his <a href="http://billday.com/2004/08/21/bamf-j2me-at-five-slides">presentation at BAMF this weekend</a>. The one that struck me the most was his mention of SIP as a major item for future development of mobile applications. Given that right before the meeting I was blogging that I wanted &#8221;<a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=328">a service that respects my mobile device not as a remote and minimal information terminal, but as a first class node within a worldwide network</a>&#8221; that really grabbed my attention. I was somewhat familiar with SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) from the Voice Over IP side. SIP is used in some VOIP implementations, and has been around for a while. I wasn&#8217;t at all familiar with the proposed uses within the mobile realm. For a quick techie overview of the protocols, which should make sense to anyone familiar with basic networking, check out <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/voice/sipsols/biggulp/bgsipov.htm">this overview from Cisco</a>. For information about how SIP fits into mobile applications, check out the <a href="http://nds1.forum.nokia.com/nnds/ForumDownloadServlet?id=5039&amp;name=SIP%5FFAQ%5Fv1%5F0%5Fen%2Epdf">FAQ from Forum Nokia</a>. Just fucking fantastic stuff. They address issues of IM and presence over the mobile networks and programmed handset to handset communication.</p>

<p>&#8220;So what?&#8221; you say. You really aren&#8217;t impressed by handset to handset communication, and you really have no need for messaging or presence. Okay, no problem there. This set of features isn&#8217;t for everyone. But it also enables a whole other set of applications that I think are mostly being overlooked right now - non-handset devices out on the cellular network. We&#8217;re seeing IP functionality merging down into the core of devices like stereo systems, video entertainment systems, security products, and home appliances. Most of these assume they get hooked into a home network of some sort, in general they&#8217;re stuck tethered to your home, and have to rely on a third party provider to facilitate the rendezvous so that you can communicate with them when you&#8217;re not at home (or a lot of technical expertise to make it so that you can communicate with them on your own). The information in the FAQ makes it sound like SIP would bring us a long way toward mobile devices that could act not only as a consumer of service, but a server for new features as well. Sounds like some kick ass stuff. In particular I would love to experiment with IM and presence that was uniform on mobile and desktop systems. I use IM as a major part of my workday, and I would like to be able to sign in to IM when I&#8217;m wandering around. Mark myself as &#8220;available, but on my mobile.&#8221; Sure, some services are setup so that I can use them from my mobile. Take <a href="http://mymobile.aol.com/portal/im/userguides.html">AIM for instance</a>, they have a few methods of using AIM from mobiles. That&#8217;s a step in the right direction, and gives me partial connectivity, but AIM is only one of the services I use. I might be a hot mobile studmuffin, but not everyone is going to switch to AIM just so that they can talk to me. What I would like to be able to do is hook my <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> server up to my mobile device, so that I can sign on to the IM account I want via SMS, not just the one my provider has server side hookups for. SIP seems to be a step in the right direction as far as I&#8217;m concerned, especially with relation to these kinds of issues. Move some of the logic off the gateways and out to the edges, keep the network dumb and have it just route uniform packets. Just like on that big Internet thing, where intelligence at the edges seems to be working quite well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/08/meeting-reminder.html">first meeting of BAMF</a>. Unfortunately we ended up needing to collect some money to cover the space. Michael O&#8217;Rourke was very generous in offering their space at <a href="http://www.dimension7.com/">Dimension 7</a> and we just need to cover the costs of setting the place up, cleaning up after it&#8217;s done, and use of their AV equipment. I looked around some to see if I could find a sponsor, but no one wanted to sponsor the first meeting of an informal group. Given that a bunch of us volunteered our own time to get this set up, and that the presenter is a volunteer, and that the cost is only $10, I&#8217;m hoping no one has any problems with that. Cause if they do I might have to smack them. That always gets things off on the wrong foot so I&#8217;m hoping to avoid it.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the event. I&#8217;ve been following mobile tech for a long time, but being involved with BAMF has got me looking a lot more at fostering the mobile community as a whole. One aspect that I&#8217;m noticing even more than I used to is the gap between the people inside the industry and the proposed users of the services and technology. Technologies seem to get developed and then &#8220;thrown over the wall&#8221; to customers. With the service providers in particular this seems to be true. They do a big roll out of MMS and cameraphone, sit back and watch the numbers, and hope they line up with expectations. Quite often the services don&#8217;t work out as expected. But that&#8217;s okay for big established companies like the service providers (AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon). They have the resources to just pick something else and try again. And there is a problem there as far as I&#8217;m concerned. Relatively random guessing is a bad way to pursue next generation technology. The really powerful aspects of mobility are NOT highly related to the old telecom industry. They&#8217;re really a completely different industry that just happens to be trapped within the existing framework of spectrum licenses and carrier exchange agreements. Eventually the industry will break out of the constraints imposed on it, the market always finds ways to make sure that maximal value is being delivered. I would love that to happen through service providers working more closely with entrepreneurs and startups to explore applications in some new areas. But even if that never comes to pass, I&#8217;m sure something will deliver me a service that respects my mobile device not as a remote and minimal information terminal, but as a first class node within a worldwide network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got back from the first <a href="http://eric.blognews.com/blog/_archives/2004/8/13/123275.html">LobbyCon in San Francisco</a>, thanks to Eric Rice for taking the initiative and getting everyone together. I personally had a really good time. I think it was very successful at recreating exactly what goes on in the lobby of tech confs. There was lots of geeky talk going on, I got to meet some people I know of from their online presence, and ran into some people who I don&#8217;t normally get a chance to talk to. Apparently <a href="http://www.jluster.org/node/266">Jonas was there for a while, but really didn&#8217;t like the venue</a> so he took off. That&#8217;s unfortunate, I would have liked to get a chance to talk to him. But that&#8217;s what happens when you try to do something different. If you&#8217;re doing it right, you should get a reaction. Hopefully there are a bunch of positives, but unfortunately there will be negatives as well. The important factor is that there is  something polarizing and not just a lukewarm mix meant to please the widest audience possible.</p>

<p>In that respect I think it was a success. I&#8217;ve gone to a bunch of different Meetup events around the area, the Weblogger Meetups in particular. And for some of them I managed to get a decent group to attend, though the only really large scale one was due to Shellen dragging a decent number of the Blogger crew out with him. But once I stopped personally beating the bushes to bring people out <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=123">no one showed up at all</a>, and that was really lame. So I started going to organized confs and events around the area, but that gets to be a pretty expensive habit. Most of the low key local events attract a lot of the same audience each time however. And the really interesting part is running into new people, which happens mostly at the confs, and those do tend to really suck cash. I figured there had to be some alternative.</p>

<p>Most of the social tools we&#8217;re using these days do a great job of facilitating conversation and making space elastic. Given that I think there is a place for events like this. Events that aren&#8217;t normally scheduled meetings on a given topic, but more someone just deciding to plant a flag in a random lobby and declaring it a discussion point. It might help to keep the events fresh and the participants from getting bored, allows the fringe events to take place (instead of getting subsumed by the majority vote for a different topic or venue), and hopefully will result in involving people who wouldn&#8217;t normally be willing or able to get involved. These might not actually be LobbyCons at all, but just the reintroduction of a normal healthy social life to those of us who spend way too much time sitting in front of a monitor. Sure, the organization is a bit more strongly electronically mediated (well, not when compared to Japanese teens organizing an adhoc social event) and includes a bit more WiFi while it&#8217;s actually going on. But essentially it&#8217;s meeting down at the neighborhood pub to shoot the shit over a few drinks. Our neighborhood is larger, but the fluidity of the activity should be the same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Eric Rice as proposed the first <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/m2m/index.cgi?lobbycon">LobbyCon</a>, to be held <a href="http://eric.blognews.com/blog/_archives/2004/7/29/114849.html">tomorrow night (August 12th) at 7:30pm in the W Hotel lobby in San Francisco</a>. I guess I&#8217;ve been hacking too much, cause I almost missed this. Sean Bonner <a href="http://www.seanbonner.com/blog/archives/000692.php#000692">posted the initial idea as LobbyCon</a> after BlogOn. I had much the same impression of BlogOn as Sean did, and we spoke about it afterward at the dinner. We have all the tools at our disposal to organize a somewhat ad-hoc conference, providing many of the advantages that we currently get from the larger events. I think it sounds like an excellent idea, but I&#8217;m normally told that my guerrilla style events just wouldn&#8217;t work. I would love for that to be wrong, so I&#8217;m going to the event tomorrow night to try to contribute what I can. Hope to see some of you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve made the arrangements for <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/08/first-meeting-of-bamf.html">the first Bay Area Mobility Forum meeting</a>. It&#8217;s Saturday August 21st at 2:00pm at 150 Folsom Street in San Francisco. I would like to personally thank Michael O&#8217;Rourke at <a href="http://www.dimension7.com/">Dimension 7 Studios</a> for helping out with a location to host the event.</p>

<p>So what is the mobility forum? The group is still forming, so I can&#8217;t give a definite answer there. I&#8217;ll give my overview of what I would like to see done. We can start from <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/06/forum-focus.html">Russ&#8217;s initial post</a> and work out from there. The confusion about the market is something that really hit home for me. I have been working for the past few years with <a href="http://www.mycasanetwork.com/">a company trying to deploy a rather advanced mobile application</a>. Confusion was the name of the game as far as that went. Service providers seemed to be bouncing around rather randomly trying to figure out how to monetize data networks that were already operating near full capacity and exhibiting maintenance problems. End users in general were unaware of the technology, and faced with a deluge of nearly incomprehensible and often contradictory information when they did attempt to get info about mobile data services. And then there were the developers staring out from the inside, wondering why so few people were adopting technology that was so obviously useful and publicly available.</p>

<p>So why would I be involved in the Bay Area Mobility Forum if it seems like mobility is generally confusing and often frustrating? Especially given that I&#8217;m not nearly as heavily involved in it as I used to be? Because I think that mobile applications have a lot of potential. Not just getting corporate email while on the road or finding the nearest restaurant. I think that mobile technology has the potential to connect people in ways that weren&#8217;t possible before, to people who weren&#8217;t reachable before. It has the potential to make people feel safer, closer, and more involved in each other&#8217;s lives. There is the potential to bring all the advantages of the Internet (currently mostly available only to people with computers, while sitting at those computers) to the rest of the world&#8217;s population. But most importantly, I want new applications to use myself.</p>

<p>In order for that to happen I think there need to be some major changes in the way that businesses view the mobile network. Although there have been some great advances in mobile technology over the last few years, deploying a new application is still a painful process. I personally believe this stems from the mobile data networks not being built on the same principles as the Internet overall. Something needs to be done to ease the cost of deploying an application so that experimentation and innovation in mobile services can proceed. That might be changes to the network itself, changes to policy, or just different methods of interacting with equipment vendors and service providers. My overall goal in helping out with the forum is determining what can be done to lower the bar for others looking to deploy new apps and services.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m over at <a href="http://www.defcon.org">DEFCON</a> listening to a presentation on <a href="http://www.freehaven.net/tor/">Tor</a>. The presentation is pretty interesting. The presenter is pretty funny at points. He&#8217;s using the term &#8220;sending a Guido&#8221; to paraphrase strong arming someone into giving you info they don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s an interesting turn of phrase. Plus the connotation is that the design of the system takes into account that there is a degree of &#8220;social capital&#8221; expenditure to attacking most anonymous systems. You can &#8220;call in a favor&#8221; to get info, but once the capital required is high enough the attack is no longer feasible. Sounds kind of like social software, but twisted somewhat. Maybe it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m aware of the diffusion of social  issues into software design, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve heard the standard attack cost argument applied to calling in social favors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeremy Zawodny has a <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002277.html">post about RSS scaling problems</a>. Something that came up as a partial solution at one of the blogger meetups was <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mogul-http-delta-10.txt">the HTTP delta proposal</a>. It&#8217;s specifically meant to address this issues:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry.</p></blockquote>

<p>From what I understand there isn&#8217;t an implementation of this proposal out in the wild. It seems like it would have applicability in more and more places however, so maybe it&#8217;s about time. This just addresses the bandwidth efficiency however, which is NOT currently most of the concern. Bandwidth is relatively cheap. There&#8217;s also scalability in terms of computing power required on the server dishing out the RSS. And requiring the server to calculate the differences between the last version that a client has and the current version might eat up more in processing power than it saves in bandwidth. Right now I&#8217;m off into the area of wild speculation however, so don&#8217;t trust what you read here. What I&#8217;m really saying is that here&#8217;s a potential scaling answer. And who knows, if implemented properly on the server side perhaps it could solve both bandwidth and processor cycles.</p>

<p>A lot of the comments in there really ring true, especially given <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=321">my thoughts in relation to the recent BlogOn event</a>. BlogOn was a great event mind you, and I would go again if I had the chance, even if just for the interaction with other attendees before, between, and after sessions. But I would have really liked to see more of the kinds of information that comes through in this interview. I particularly liked the answer to question #2 from the first session:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think that the more that individuals can realize how their unique skills and resources and opportunities (themselves or combined with their founding team) can come together in a tangible way that delivers value to customers, the greater their chance of success. I&#8217;m not talking about entrepreneurship as a selfish quest for identity - but the need to pour what you know and care about and are good at into a healthy venture.</p></blockquote>

<p>I would personally love to see an event focused on these kinds of issues. Not really where the next big thing is, but where are we now and what can we do with it? The technologies enable new forms of interaction and new methods of communicating, sure. But now what? What do these new forms mean to the business owner or entrepreneur? In what business directions should we be looking? I think Tom does a great job of laying down a business overview here, and I get the feeling that more directed questioning on any one topic would turn up a wealth of great info. I would love to hear him speak at an event. So there&#8217;s my vote.</p>
