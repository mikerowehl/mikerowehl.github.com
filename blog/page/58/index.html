  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just signed up for the <a href="https://www.vlab.org/204.cfm?eventID=40">Existing Opportunities in the Security Market</a> event being held over at Stanford. The bullet list of topics for the discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are there still untapped opportunities in the information security market?</p></li>
<li><p>What does the move toward a risk mitigation-based ROI approach mean for security vendors?</p></li>
<li><p>How do corporate security officers and IT directors assess risk within their own IT environments?</p></li>
<li><p>What role do IT security products play in overall enterprise risk management?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It sounds like it could be pretty interesting. I did work for a while as the security manager for a pretty large startup down in Passadena, and I learned a hell of a lot in the process. Even among the most competent and insightful of the information technology workers, security is something of a black art. I think a lot of the issues stem from security directly straddling both financial and information technology roles. This is true with just about any technology work, but I see it most pronounced with security. Most people still start their security work at the &#8220;how can I secure this system?&#8221; question. When in actuality the first security question should be something along the lines of &#8220;what is the risk of running this system and how much am I willing to pay to assuage that risk?&#8221; I think that&#8217;s what most of those bullet points up there are all about. I thank one of the security consultants I worked with down in LA for pointing out to me that the real role of security within an organization isn&#8217;t securing systems, it&#8217;s managing risk. So Chris, if you end up reading this, thanks for opening my eyes to that so early on.</p>

This year end summary provides a great opportunity to spin through the top items of the year and review ones I was too busy to dig into the first time around.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/000504.html">Entry in Seth Finkelstein&#8217;s blog</a> pondering why it is that people keep blogs. He mentions some of the common reasons in there, like exposure to a new audience if you&#8217;re running a business related blog, and the simple need to communicate which is fulfilled by a daily diary. I actually did a whole lot of thinking along these lines before I wrote the first version of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>. I know a lot of reasons showed up once I started blogging that I didn&#8217;t expect at first. Maintaining my blog has actually helped me organize my thoughts and keep something of a schedule. It provides a great regime for me to stick to in processing the news I read and trying to fit the new content into my world view. It encourages some thoughtful introspection where before there was absolutely none.</p>

<p>But even if all the blogs were mostly just mundane drivel, as <a href="http://www.streettech.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=376">Nate seems to think a lot of them might be</a>, I actually don t think they inherently can&#8217;t be useful. I wrote up an <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/blogging_for_nerds.html">article kinda thing</a> laying down some thoughts I had along the line of how lots and lots of meaningless drivel can add up to something useful. Just take a look at projects like <a href="http://www.everything2.com/">Everything2</a> and their effort to node everything. To a degree, blogs can be viewed as the same type of node network, just not under central control. Now, I admit that the value of the node network itself is still very dubious. But it is at least one tick mark in favor of just &#8220;writing about everything&#8221;. This human society of ours is still very much based on social policy and morality. And at the end of the day, social policy and morality boil down the sum of public opinion. So even the most mundane and droll opinion is significant. Especially if it can be counted and analyzed because the author has chosen to share the info.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a great document titled <a href="http://www.kniggit.net/wwol26.html">The Wonderful World of Linux 2.6</a> that I just got finished reading over. An excellent summary of all the things to look for (and to look out for) in the new kernel release. I&#8217;ve been running the 2.6test series for a while and I&#8217;ve had good luck with it so far. Tonight I&#8217;m about to upgrade myself to the official 2.6 release. What I would really like to do is find the time to play around with the embedded Linux changes. At one point I did get Linux running on my girlfriends old Handspring, using the <a href="http://palm-linux.sourceforge.net/">uCLinux port with the palm loader</a>. And I dug around for a while and found the old version of xcopilot in the uCLinux repository and played with that. But I never had enough time to really get into learning about the uCLinux specific stuff. Now that the core kernel has options to support all of those changes, I really have to dedicate some time to learning about them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031222174158852">a post over at Groklaw</a> with Linus&#8217;s response to the files that SCO says were coppied. Basically, it looks like bunk. Which is what a lot of us expected. SCO has tried sighting files which are so heavily standardized that any implementation would look the same. But still, there are very telltale mistakes in the Linux version which make it appear that the files were written to try to impement the interfaces by a novice programmer, not coppied from a 20 year old codebase. I hope SCO just gets completely blasted out of the water and we can forget about their annoying charade. If they can&#8217;t succeed in running their business, they can at least go out with some dignity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve released verion 1.7 of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>, although I suspect the change won&#8217;t really affect most people. I expanded the amount of memory available for processing the blog list. There used to be a limit of 10 blogs, now it&#8217;ll use a lot more (31 is the limit of my testing so far). Why would one need that many blogs? Well, I actually spoke to some of the people who work over at Blogger.com last week, and the people who were interested in using the app have 20 blogs or more. So of course I fixed up the app. Hopefully it would negatively affect anyone, and this way the <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> crew maybe wander around and tell people how ph4t Vagablog is. Probably not, but I am allowed to hope, aren&#8217;t I?</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;re a normal user and for some reason 1.7 isn&#8217;t working out for you, you can always just use 1.6, you&#8217;re not missing anything unless you have 10 blogs attached to a single account. Let <a href="mailto:vagablog@bitsplitter.net">us know about the issue</a> of course, what OS version you&#8217;re running, what device. I would really appreciate that. I&#8217;ll mark it down as something to clean up in the future. But unless you&#8217;re getting crazy with the cheeze whiz, you shouldn&#8217;t need 1.7 anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally found <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/latest.htm">the location on the USGS site</a> that has realtime maps of earthquake activity, so I was able to verify the shaking that I felt. It still hasn&#8217;t shown up on the list of quakes, but at least the map there told me there was a big quake in central California. And other people in San Francisco said they felt it too. Ah, an <a href="http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/neic_crah.html">update from the USGS site</a>. It&#8217;s really really official now. I feel validated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting here reading news and suddenly my monitor start swaying from side to side. Afraid my cheap cardtable/desk is about to give way I hop up, but feel unsteady on my feet. The blinds are swaying back and forth, and I can see the sliding doors on the closets shifting some. Earthquake? I&#8217;m not quite sure. Maybe just some odd settling in my old appartment building. So I think &#8220;I&#8217;ll check online&#8221;. But then realize I have no idea where to find news quite that immediate. I know it&#8217;s out there somewhere. But am I seeing nothing in blogs and news sites cause it was a localized event? Or because the sites just haven&#8217;t been updated yet?</p>
