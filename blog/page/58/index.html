  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally found <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/latest.htm">the location on the USGS site</a> that has realtime maps of earthquake activity, so I was able to verify the shaking that I felt. It still hasn&#8217;t shown up on the list of quakes, but at least the map there told me there was a big quake in central California. And other people in San Francisco said they felt it too. Ah, an <a href="http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/neic_crah.html">update from the USGS site</a>. It&#8217;s really really official now. I feel validated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting here reading news and suddenly my monitor start swaying from side to side. Afraid my cheap cardtable/desk is about to give way I hop up, but feel unsteady on my feet. The blinds are swaying back and forth, and I can see the sliding doors on the closets shifting some. Earthquake? I&#8217;m not quite sure. Maybe just some odd settling in my old appartment building. So I think &#8220;I&#8217;ll check online&#8221;. But then realize I have no idea where to find news quite that immediate. I know it&#8217;s out there somewhere. But am I seeing nothing in blogs and news sites cause it was a localized event? Or because the sites just haven&#8217;t been updated yet?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000156.php">an interesting entry in John Battelle&#8217;s blog</a> about adding a blogging mechanism that allows readers to optionally expose their reading habbits so that others can somewhat &#8220;read over their shoulder&#8221; (my own term for it). I&#8217;ve been interested in this for a while, mostly looking it from the knowledge management end. The closest that I&#8217;ve seen so far is the properly applied use of trackbacks. Trackback is a mechanism that allows blog A to send a message to blog B, with the message containing information for blog B about a referencing entry in blog A. The theory is that readers of blog B will then be able to read what others have posted on the topic. Trackbacks are far from universal however, and they only let one blog know about another, not about the general habbits of the readers at large. It would be nice to see a way for the mostly passive readers of blogs be able to participate in knowledge creation. I thought I remembered systems aimed at this type of thing, but a quick web search didn&#8217;t turn up anything along the lines of what I thought was out there. Maybe the projects were completely killed. Or maybe I&#8217;m just crazy. Either way, I think it would be worth experimenting with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jim Bray <a href="http://as220.org/jb/weblog/Cellphone/index.html#Ussp-push">hacked up the ussp-push tool</a> I have up on <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/hacking/bluez-rfcomm-obex.html">unrooted.net</a> and made a .deb out of it, should be a nice easy install path now. I made that available a long time ago, and apparently it&#8217;s still what people pick up pretty frequently.</p>

<p>Getting the email from Jim made me really think about the whole Bluetooth situation more than I have in a few months now. I&#8217;ve stopped following BlueZ for the most part. I have systems at my appartment setup so that I can backup and restore my t68i, and get a network connection with my Palm devices, but for the most part all the new Bluetooth functions just aren&#8217;t very usefull. They&#8217;re a pain because I can never tell what is going to work with which devices, and I&#8217;m a lot more knowledgeable than most when it comes to this stuff. But unless I&#8217;m using bluetooth to hook two Linux systems together, almost nothing is guaranteed to work. I wish the problem was just Linux Bluetooth, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be. My father tried to get a Bluetooth dongle setup with his Windows system so that he could get a network connection using his Tungsten, but also no luck there. I can&#8217;t help but think that the Bluetooth people have just really missed their opportunity for mass adoption. There might be a chance that they can recover some point down the line. Say if there are very pointed applications that get Bluetooth radios out and in use, and the software ends up supporting extra features that then see wider adoption. But the commonly sighted stats that the Bluetooth people are proud of is that there are millions of radios deployed. Great, but how many of those radios are in real use? And how many are being used in the way that the user really intended them to be? Most of the stories that I hear from others mirror my own experience. That others can get some Bluetooth features working, but not too many. And that many users with Bluetooth enabled devices have never even turned on the radio before (I base this off of Clie, Tungsten, and t68i users, many of whom have never used the Bluetooth functions in their devices at all).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/participate/schedule/">schedule posted at the Fedora site</a>. Sure RedHat may have moved it&#8217;s support to only the enterprize versions, but I still think the Fedora version is going to rock. I just wish I had a test system free so that I could muck around with the new releases and maybe help out some. The release plans for integration of the 2.6 version of the kernel, which I think is very cool. Guess I&#8217;ll have to wait till it stabilizes some&#8230;. aww man.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.itwales.com/cgi/showsite/showpage.cgi?998973">an interview with Alan Cox at ITWales.com</a>. He talks about patent law in Europe and open source for businesses. If he ends up doing user interface work instead of kernel work when he goes back to RedHat it could be really interesting. Projects like Gnome and KDE are rolling along, but they no longer have the big splashes that they used to. Maybe because they&#8217;re somewhat established now, and the things they end up doing just don&#8217;t seem as exciting as the initial steps did. But Cox participating in the desktop end might have a lot of impact, and reinvigorate whatever area he decides to participate in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a link to <a href="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2281736">this article</a> in <a href="http://evhead.com/">Evan Williams blog</a>. It takes a look at the social, political, and scientific networking which was commonly done in coffeehouses, and compares that interaction with what currently happens through the Internet. I had heard plenty about the use of coffeehouses as seats of political revolution, but I hadn&#8217;t heard of their use in scientific circles till I read this. There is a lot of parallelism between the role that coffeehouses provided and the role that weblogs and websites serve today, but I think that online interaction serves a role much less important than it could. If we take a look at the strong communities that did grow around coffeehouses, and around some strong scientific networking figures like <a href="http://www.paulerdos.com/">Paul Erdos</a>, the effects of the Internet seem much more subdued. The Internet has done great in terms of facilitating exchange of information, and it certainly has allowed for the formation of community where there wasn&#8217;t the critical mass before. It has allowed for great advances, I just think it should be going further.</p>

<p>I think the issue could be that the standard coffee-house gathering style, when available, is just more appealing than online interaction. When online communities grow they don&#8217;t always connect with the real world equivalents. To use a recent example, the <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/">Weblogger Meetup</a> here in the Bay Area is quite poorly attended. I emailed a bunch of people and we had a decent turnout last month. But previous months it&#8217;s been quite dead. There are a lot of bloggers in the Bay Area, why are the meetups so poorly attended? I think one reason is that people in the area already have an outlet for their geekiness. Meetup offers people a way to use the internet to form real world social connections. But in the Bay Area people already have those social connections in place. They don&#8217;t need to go online to find a place to geek out over networking protocols and obscure copyright laws and regulations. At least some of their friends are already deep enough into those topics that they can get their fill during normal interaction.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s primarily in places where the real world network is thin that supplementing it with online gathering tools is really necessary. And I don&#8217;t mean that this only happens in places where there are few people overall. The geeky meetups in New York might be very well attended. But I think that boils down to the same reason. The social network surrounding high tech topics can be quite thin. Which is quite different than here in San Francisco, where you can hardly walk a block without hearing someone talking about how to schedule DNS zone transfers or arguing over the decision to use qmail. I think that people have such a fill of geek topics during the average day that they don&#8217;t seek out online community unless they&#8217;re really extreme cases. I think the same kind of thing probably happens in other areas with other concentrations as well (Hollywood and movies, Detroit and automobiles, Manhattan and finance, etc.) The Internet does a great job of creating communities, but they&#8217;re still restricted communities. The online versions don&#8217;t commonly attract interest from the real world nexus participants. This frequently leaves online communities as rather weak appendages when compared to the overall body of knowledge and social networks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100287">an article at TheFeature</a> describing the challenges in billing presented by cellular services trying to create personalized service packages. It sounds like a great solution that Portal Software has come up with, but I still think this is a step in the wrong direction. I just don&#8217;t want my cellular provider to have a hand in everything I do on the cellular network. The new billing system at least sounds like it could be flexable, so it shouldn&#8217;t cause too many issues too soon. But what happens when the cellular usage patterns start to defy the object model presented by the software? It could end up in new technologies not getting implemented because of the infrastructure implications.</p>

<p>It could be possible that the software allows for a completely fluid set of associations, but I&#8217;m betting that this also puts the cellular provider in charge of who can be a third party in the billing process. Something that&#8217;s already started with data services IMO (ever try to get a server component that can send MMS messages to any cell phone?) and is causing trouble in that space. This would just further extend the stranglehold that cellular providers have over their customers. If anyone has a pointer to some details about how the third party billing associations are setup and utilized within the Portal Software solution, please <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">drop me a line</a>.</p>
