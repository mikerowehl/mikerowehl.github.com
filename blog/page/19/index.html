  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard that the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/5968">&#8220;Just&#8221; Use HTTP</a> session by Sam Ruby was good (it was the first day of ETech, which I missed).  Not to fear! The <a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/etcon/">slides for the session</a> are online. They talk about a bunch of issues that go in and around trying to use HTTP - character encodings, URL encodings, defaults, case of specifiers, where markup is valid in documents. Working with RSS one quickly becomes intimately familiar with the differences between XML processing as practiced between components of your own application and processing of documents out on the Internet.  Notice I don&#8217;t say XML processing out on the Internet. Apparently there&#8217;s no such thing. So many documents out there are nonvalidating so often that it&#8217;s not even worth trying to process them with a standard XML parser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gregory Blake is one of the latest to <a href="http://www.ezoons.com/2005/03/17/blogger_feedster_spammers_useless.html">complain about all the garbage postings coming out of blogspot.com</a>. That issue was part of the motivation for putting up the changes yesterday to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=464">detect result sets dominated by single sources</a>. Of course that only helps if you&#8217;re using the website for your searches. But there are a bunch of other tools (like <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>) that provide shortcuts for subscribing to search feeds. In order to exclude blogspot all you have to do is append -site:blogspot.com to your searches. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of what that would look like in NetNewsWire 2.0 beta:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/images/subwobloglines.jpg" alt="Subscribe to a search excluding bloglines" /></p>

<p>We&#8217;re actually <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/archives/131-Turning-Blogspot-Off.html">considering turning blogspot.com off by default</a> because of how bad the results are in some areas. Rafer has some <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/archives/2005/03/feedster_blogge.html">additional commentary</a>. It would be really unfortunate to have to turn off that whole domain just to clean up the results. It would get rid of spam, but it would also get rid of good content. There are some great blogs over there (<a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a>, <a href="http://tedshelton.blogspot.com/">Ted Shelton</a>, <a href="http://reinventioninc.blogspot.com/">re:invention</a>, <a href="http://106miles.blogspot.com">106Miles</a>, <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/">Small Busines Trends</a>, <a href="http://jurvetson.blogspot.com/">Steve Jurvetson</a>, and <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/">Anita Wilhelm</a> - just to give the blogspot blogs I&#8217;m currently subscribed to). So my personal preference would be to not turn off the blogspot.com results by default, and ask everyone to bear with us while Google takes care of the issues with the content of the blogspot domain and we tune our spam detection. But please let us know what you think. Blogspot.com excluded by default?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is my post from the plane on the way home from ETech.  It was just a day trip, so we&#8217;re headed back to Menlo Park already.  It would have been great to hang out for longer, but there&#8217;s feeds to get indexed and tools to get written. I wanted to get my overall impressions down. Something that Niall said at one point is that he likes to try to put stuff online that really gives people a feel for what living in Silicon Valley is like. I think that&#8217;s a great goal to have at times, sharing the experience. So here&#8217;s my post trying to sum up what it&#8217;s like to go to ETech. Understanding of course that my take on the whole thing might be biased because I&#8217;m working with a relatively well known company right now, and I went with Russ, who&#8217;s apparently a rock star these days (thanks for introducing me to everyone Russ!).</p>

<p>So my impression going in was that I would have really strongly pointed takeaway from each of the sessions.  And really, I didn&#8217;t find that.  The sessions were interesting, there was good content in there, and it triggered a lot of new ideas and connections. And really many of the sessions were kinda mushy.  If I take a look through the notes I posted on my blog, there is no clear bullet point (or even set of 3 to 6 bullet points) behind most of the sessions that I attended.  There was also quite a bit of just general marketing and information dispersal activity.  I take the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=458">Mobile Computing on the Edge</a> talk from Nokia as an example here.  It was good info, I&#8217;m just not really sure it belonged at the &#8220;Emerging Technologies&#8221; conference.  What they were talking about was really evolving most of the technologies under discussion.  I expected a whole bunch of &#8220;this is a demo of some of the ideas we&#8217;ve been playing with in the labs&#8221; kinda sessions.  And while we did get a pinch of that in the Python on Series 60 session (which by the way I think might have been my favorite) in general it was mostly talk about how to evolve tagging and folksonomies and web services. A good discussion, but not quite what I expected.  I would rate the talks good, but not spectacular.</p>

<p>Now, the people. Yea, that was spectacular. And this is really where I think heading out there with someone who&#8217;s already tied into the group somewhat really helped out.  I had met about twenty of the people at the conference face to face previously, and talked to another ten or so of them online.  But I met about 40 people just because Russ would pull me over and go &#8220;hey, have you met &#8230;.&#8221; Which was great, cause while I have no trouble walking up to strangers and introducing myself, it&#8217;s nice to have a bit of common ground to work out from when first meeting.  And the people there were really very interesting. #mobitpians, and people working on Haskel based open source application server developers and mobile tools, and a whole bunch of bloggers.</p>

<p>So what was it like sitting in the sessions and wandering around in the hallways and lobby?  One of the most important things is so make sure that you have your laptop and the right tools to take part in everything going on.  As I was listening to the sessions I would write down little bits of what stuck out for me for my posts, pull up web pages mentioned, IM with other people in the audience, listen to the IRC channel, and every once in a while refresh the tags pages/feedster search/attention aggregator page.  It really was like being awash in information.  And I know I only caught bits and pieces of what went through those rooms during the day.  But I skimmed out the top 10% (or however much it ends up being) of the stuff that relates to what I&#8217;m doing or interested in, and now I have a bunch of new people to talk to about the stuff.  For the sessions that have notes available from the presenters, or that have audio available at some point, I might go back through and reskim after letting this sink in for a while.  But in general it was the whole experience of skimming the bits and peices out and then trying to match them up to what others had that was the most interesting.  Mostly they were mismatches, I just tend not to take the same kinds of stuff away as most other people do.  I think that&#8217;s probably a good thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We pushed out some changes to the front end at Feedster.  For example, take a look at <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;limit=15&amp;q=slashdot&amp;sort=date">this search for &#8220;slashdot&#8221;</a>. If the results haven&#8217;t changed by the time you read that, you get a hint on the top of the results page saying that most of the results are from a single source.  Namely slashdot.org. And it gives you some links there to either exclude the site, or list only results from that site. The underlying features necessary to do that have been in there, but now we detect the condition and give some links to do what we think someone would want to do in response.  We&#8217;ve been getting lots of feedback that some searches are dominated by a single source, and in general they&#8217;re a source that would better be ignored. So here&#8217;s a way to filter the results easily when that happens. And it&#8217;s discoverable, not a hidden option that someone has to go looking for, it&#8217;s right there when you need it most (hopefully). So does that work out well?  Let us know. Are there other conditions we should be picking up?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6484">The Easier, Faster Route to Building Mobile Applications: Using the Best of Existing Approaches and Overcoming Current Limitations</a></p>

<p>Rodney from <a href="http://www.mfoundry.com/">MFoundry</a> presented, I know him from <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a>.</p>

<p>Typical lifecycle: development -> application testing -> device testing &lt; - > porting</p>

<p>You can optionally also go through certification and signing, and then on to provisioning.</p>

<p>Be prepared to buy phones! for testing by the way, you won&#8217;t make it anywhere talking to the carrier without running on the actual hardware.</p>

<p>The MFoundry model is Development -> application testing -> provisioning.</p>

<p>Two ways to get things onto phone, which really boil down to one, you download it.  Called OTA (Over The Air) - that just means you download it.</p>

<p>Available applciation technologies (US) - 75% J2ME, 20% BREW, 5% other (PalmOS, .Net CF, SymbianOS)</p>

<p>WAP, it&#8217;s easy to do, there&#8217;s a lot of support for it, low cost, flexible, poor user experience. Compare that with applications, which have good graphics , threading, caching, and has a good user interface.  But it&#8217;s more expensive, there&#8217;s a lot of training to do, porting, and to update you have to install a new version (compared to an online service, no update needed there).  Applications are for serious developers only, but WAP is a suboptimal solution.</p>

<p>MWorks is the mFoundry approach, best of both.  Development is done in XML and published to the server for download. There&#8217;s some software running on the phone, MRE (moblet runtime environment). Super tiny, 52k. MIL, moblet instruction language, is all that it understands.</p>

<p>MRE &lt; -> mWorks Service &lt; -> Content/Databases/Web Services</p>

<p>mWorks Services.  XML is a bloated format, lots of overhead. The primary role of the mWorks services is compression, encoding. If you&#8217;re interested, W3C, WAP Binary XML is the standard to check out. They call it binary XML in their version, bXML, which gets better compression than the spec version.</p>

<p>They use Eclipse for development, they have a plugin. The other side is the mWorks portal, which isn&#8217;t that compelling for smaller shops, but for the enterprise it&#8217;s very interesting.  Portal still is under development, going public in the next month or two.</p>

<p>The current version has full coverage of MIDP 1.0. Everything available through MIDP 1.0 is exposed via the XML language. That means there&#8217;s a lot that isn&#8217;t accessable from the phone functions, so this is not the platform for you if you&#8217;re doing a game. This is good for portals and data applications.</p>

<p>Use ME for SE emulation, a version of ME running on top of Java.</p>

<p>The interface for MFoundry by default looks much more like a &#8220;media player&#8221; than the default Brew or Java look.  Mostly forms based.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an XML parser, by the same people who did MEforSE.</p>

<p>So how do you develop?  It all start with a .mil file.  MIL is a declarative language. Screen description, options (buttons), http service. You can upload an XSL filter to the server to run to compress the information.</p>

<p>So you have information on the device, you want to put it on the screen.  For an imperative language you would use a foreach, in MIL you use XPath. You have a tag called a repeater, that repeats markup for each node that matches an expression.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in developing, they&#8217;re offering a beta program for early developers.  All the tools are free.</p>

<p>People always suggesting things to do, WS is our way of saying &#8220;Great, those sound like great ideas, show us!&#8221; Also want to test the waters, the way that any project has a particular flavor they want to find out what kind of project the Yahoo APIs will turn into.</p>

<p>obLink: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com">http://developer.yahoo.com</a></p>

<p>Docs, SDK, Wiki, Blog, Lists. REST interface to search can be seen as just the first step, there will be more.</p>

<p>5,000 queries/day/service, IP restricted. Non-Commercial use. IP based so that you can share applications with friends, you should be able to distribute your app without causing the user to go sign up for a login or anything. If you go over your limit, you get locked out for a day.</p>

<p>Example app: <a href="http://buzz.progphp.com/">ImageSearchBuzz</a> (<a href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/33-Buzzing-the-Yahoo!-Search-Web-Services.html">desc</a>)</p>

<p>You can actually get RSS out of Yahoo searches.  The same service that outputs the API results can output RSS.  Actually, RSS is available already for the Yahoo search pages. <a href="http://api.search.yahoo.com/WebSearchService/rss/webSearch.xml?appid=yahoosearchwebrss&amp;query=bitsplitter&amp;adult_ok=1">like this</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently somewhere there&#8217;s a query based on longitute and lattitude, it&#8217;s in the documentation somewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/7020">Erik Smartt</a> about Mobile Python.</p>

<p>Apparently you can take a photo from the script, I missed what the UI looks like though.</p>

<p>import camera
i = camera.take_photo()
f.write(i)</p>

<p>I tried this out with the version of python I have and it doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s a camera module.  Maybe there&#8217;s an update?</p>

<p>The default interface to python is driven by a python script, default.py.  You can hack that to make it look whatever way you want. Erik has a tabbed interface for his version. Showed off OpenGL python also.  The code is ugly and eventually crashes the phone, but it works.</p>

<p>So what if you like scripting, but don&#8217;t like python? Someone else had sent him a demo of Perl 5.8.6 on Symbian.</p>

<p>What if you were running a webserver and mod_perl and mod_python?  With access to the hardware, access to the local from a remote browser is pretty interesting. For instance, browsing from another phone.</p>

<p>Nokia continuing to develop, focus on next gen devices and modules for core device functionality. Location info. Not looking at XML parsers and generic Python functions.</p>

<p>Question about supporting other series of devices.  Will it support series 80?  Erik says he has no idea. The port of python itself is rather generic, done as a port to Symbian.  But in order to finish up the interface it needed to be hooked into Series 60 specific stuff.</p>

<p>Someone asked about a central place to share code, Erik said there isn&#8217;t anything yet.</p>

<p>The ability to make adhoc connections that make sense to you, late binding communities. Have seen evolution of platforms and technologies that make this work over the last few years. The edge is where unexpected things happen. The center is stodgy. Nothing dynamic and interesting happens at the center.  At the edge you get communities coming together dynamically. In order to make the edge work they&#8217;ve been evolving technologies, like Java. We&#8217;re starting to see the ease of use that makes the edge available to everyone (mom).  Reliability and robustness. Performance systems that can deliver the interactions required. Scalable solutioins, partly on the device, partly back in the server room.  Also want to run disconnected. Management is bringing about tied together systems, no system admin needed, Mom can play with these things without having to be a PC expert.</p>

<p>Industry opportunities. Java, lots of devices and operators out there. Lots of vendors do. Distribution, you need to get your application out to the edge. Nokia has Preminet for that.</p>

<p>C++, Python, Java, Flash, XML stackup on the slide now.</p>

<p>Multichannel connections on the edge. Web service, Data sync, Peer to peer, Event/SMS. Bluetooth, GSM, WiFi. These should switch around as necessary.  As a developer you should have access to all these, and you should be able to tell when you switch so that you can adapt. Security environemtns, like Liberty. SMS is tied into the programming infrastructure, you can tie into events in either direction. Most interesting right now is peer 2 peer. Bluetooth and IR he mentions.. but that&#8217;s NOT all.  We want peer to peer over wide area connections! SIP! Please.  Peer 2 Peer is not just local area.</p>

<p>Middleware on the edge. It&#8217;s made a big difference in the server so far.  New is to do middleware on the device (gaming engines). You can create middleware services (API or background service) and load them directly onto the device. You can put connections to your systems right on the device. SAP is looking at this. &#8220;Exposee the value of the backend&#8230;.&#8221; Game companies also looking at this (IR chat an example). This is a new marketplace.</p>

<p>Managing the edge. Complete management infrastructure.  This is what frees mom from having to do admin.  Real time monitoring. Push and pull software (you can push without user intervention).  Reatime inspection. Remote provisioning.</p>

<p>Lots of opportunities at the edge. Go to forum nokia.</p>

<p>This was much more of a marketing pitch than I had hoped for. Awww man, I was hoping for more.</p>

<p>Cobbled together a lab, teachers loved it, trouble was there was no fileserver.  District has a &#8220;master plan&#8221;, but they currently don&#8217;t have fileservers.  Tried pen drives, but that wasn&#8217;t optimal.  Learned about wikis.  Didn&#8217;t want it out in the public. District didn&#8217;t like to have servers on the premisis.  Would need their own tech support.  Ran across instiki.  Teachers have ibooks, instiki is installed in there, they got a bit of training and configured it to use rendezvous. The work lives on the ibook, the teacher can close the book down and take the work home with them to review.</p>

<p>Teachers and students have been able to pick it up very quickly.  When the teacher shuts down the work is safe. Problems are with the teachers laptop going to sleep, the laptop not being there when teachers are out.</p>

<p>What would be intesting?  Having the lesson plan populate template pages for the class and each student. There is a student information silo however, this is a general problem with any tool you want to use in a school.  SchoolTool is an open source project to create an admin platform for schools. Untimately aimed at developing world.  Web services, hackable. Once you have the services open source tying together a wiki and the online admin info is simple.</p>

<p>SchoolBell is a calendar system for small groups of all types.  It&#8217;s been pulled out of SchoolTool and released on it&#8217;s own.</p>
