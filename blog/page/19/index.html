  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got a note from JD that <a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/03/ourmedia_is_her.html">Ourmedia is live today</a>! The timing is great. There&#8217;s a lot of attention going into podcasting and videoblogging, and I think a free platform for sharable and reusable media could potentially help to shift the attention away from traditional broadcast and into the realm of peer-produced content. Elle and I both helped out on the metadata definition parts during the early stages as well as some early testing (I&#8217;m <a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/7">user number 7</a>). The project is meant to provide a place for people to store the media they want to share with others. Some of the most compelling examples I heard were citizen jounalism and politcal ads. They have both <a href="http://ourmedia.org/videos">video</a> and <a href="http://ourmedia.org/audios">audio</a> content up, and if you sign up for an account you can upload your own. A lot of the ideas that <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Larry Lessig</a> talks about in Free Culture really helped to drive my motivation in paying attention to and helping out with projects like this. Curious what those ideas are?  Check out <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/">a free copy of Free Culture</a> or one of the movies explaining the importance of having works out in public and available for reuse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people blog about the famous people they run into when they go to confs like <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETech</a>, so I&#8217;m gonna blog about some of the people you might not know who I ran into at the conference instead, and some of the kick ass stuff they&#8217;re working on.</p>

<p>Albert Drouart (<a href="http://www.tomosoftware.com/">Tomo Software</a>, <a href="http://www.soracity.com/">Sora</a>) - Albert pinged Russ and I cause he&#8217;s looking to start a <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">MobileMonday</a> in LA.  Tomo is working on something that seems like a merger of MMORPG and alternate reality gaming, the beta is called <a href="http://www.soracity.com/">Sora</a>.  They have a &#8220;virtual world&#8221; that runs like a simulation of a large set of rules.  You have a persona/avatar that you control by setting preferences (Does my avatar like to ski? Or gamble?  What kinds of clothes does it wear? What kinds of possions does it have?) that guide the progression through the world.  The game is basically there running on the server all the time, and you connect to check up on your alternate persona and make changes if you want.  I think it sounds pretty interesting.  It seems to hit that sweet spot of providing a &#8220;rich game&#8221; but without making you sit there for hours playing it at a time.  Little slices
of updates, little tweeks here and there.  But an expansive world that&#8217;s being exposed to you bit by bit.  Really reminded me of what Tom said about <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101405&amp;sh=game%20rich&amp;ref=6273661">Casual Gaming</a> not needing to be shallow. Nice! Albert, it was great to meet you.  Good luck setting up the new Mobile Monday, and keep us posted!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.allthings.mp">Anthony Eden</a> (<a href="http://www.tagsurf.com">Tagsurf</a>, <a href="http://www.get.mp/">dotMP</a>) - I&#8217;ve exchanged emails with Anthony before, I got a developer key for Tagsurf so that I could play around with a few things.  Anthony is working on some projects with Russ, but also involved in the dotMP top level domain. I had read about what they were doing, but apparently I didn&#8217;t really grok it.  After talking to Anthony I have a completely different take on what the service provides.  For the geeks, they have a system which allows them to setup the dotMP TLD for you and provision email, blogging, and WAP/XHTML serving.  For the non-geeks it provides a way for you to personalise your online activities.  For those of you who have seen the WINKsite style services, this is a similar set of features with a TLD tied to it.  It could potentially add a layer of virtualizatioin to the online service component of any carrier
service offering.  It&#8217;s interesting stuff for the geeks, and probably would be of value to the nongeeks, but it&#8217;ll take figuring out how to simplify the value proposition so that people who aren&#8217;t already in the industry will understand it.  Hell, even I glossed over it the first few times I read about it and then stopped paying attention.  Apparently the press they got at the start wasn&#8217;t
that great, the authors were enthusiastic but unfortunately a bit underinformed.  I think the service is worth another look, even if for no other reason than Anthony is an obviously very smart guy who&#8217;s enthusiastic about what they&#8217;re doing. If you buy into the concept of <a href="http://www.buzzhit.com/2005/03/speculating-on-yahoo-ypn-and.html">building a microcontent stack</a> that folks like Tony Gentile have mentioned before, the dotMP project represents a big chuck of the stack for mobile devices.</p>

<p>Ewan Spence (<a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/">AllAboutSymbian</a>, <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/mobiles/">The Mobiles Show</a>) and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/98881922@N00/">Crow</a>- Ewan I know from #mobitopia on freenode.net IRC, but this is the first time I&#8217;ve met him in real life.  Ewan participates in <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com">AllAboutSymbian</a>, a great community site, and has been extending into doing podcasts recently (I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=439">commented about them a little while ago</a>, I really liked the first few episodes).  Ewan grabbed me to talk about the Mobile Monday events in the US, and we recorded a bit of audio that may show up in one of their future shows.  He&#8217;s also going to be doing a rock podcast, showcasing unsigned bands from his home area for <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/">The Podcast Network</a>. Sounds like some of the stuff that <a href="http://www.ericrice.com">Eric Rice</a> was talking about with his &#8220;bringing podcasting to the people&#8221; kinda rants.  Maybe these two should hook up? We&#8217;ll have to see if we can get Ewan to visit us over in the Bay Area at some point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nick showed up today with some funky <a href="http://www.techspot.com/story12866.html">running shoes that adjust in the field</a>. Being a geek I just had to take some pictures.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos8.flickr.com/6799585_c7a89a0e06_o.jpg" alt="View of the little motors" />
<img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/6799689_b5a57d6338_o.jpg" alt="View of the controls" /></p>

<p>When you push the buttons on the side you can see the little motors spin on the bottom and adjust the chambers. There&#8217;s a battery housed over the motor. It has embedded sensors as well apparently, and also adjusts as you run to compensate for changing conditions. It even comes with an instruction manual:</p>

<p><img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/6799803_417f532ab0_o.jpg" alt="Instruction manual" /></p>

<p>So does that make Nick a cyborg (in the <a href="http://wearcam.org/index.html">Steve Mann</a> sense) when he goes out running? Depends where you draw the line of course, but it certainly is a step in the right direction. You can take that as a pun or not, your choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read about <a href="http://rnd.historicalfact.com/phonetags/">PhoneTags</a> that BBC has setup. It&#8217;s an app that allows you to &#8220;bookmark&#8221; a song from your mobile and then go tag and rate the song later on from a desktop. Although the tagging and rating are cool, what has me really jazzed is the interaction style. It&#8217;s a perfect example of the &#8220;situated computing&#8221; interaction style that I&#8217;ve been talking about. Because your mobile is always with you and always attached to the network, it&#8217;s a perfect way to mark a particular instance in time. Which the BBC is able to then map back to a particular track. And all the expect is a simple &#8220;X&#8221; single character text message to mark the spot, minimal amount of intrusion and effort at that particular instance. And you&#8217;re motivated to go back and check out what the name of that cool song was, at which point you can tag and rate it if you want. Sexy. I like this a lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made the <a href="http://www.ri.gov/news/pr_publist.php">Rhode Island Government Press Releases</a> <a href="http://www.feedster.com/fotd.php">feed of the day at Feedster</a> today. Because everyone should be intimately familiar with the goings on in the smallest state in the US? No, not at all. I put it up because I wanted to showcase a use of RSS somewhere outside of the geekery I&#8217;ve been involved in all week long (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with geekery mind you!). Here&#8217;s some of the description from the <a href="http://www2.sec.state.ri.us/rss/">RSS info page on the Rhode Island website</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Much of the information maintained by the Office of Secretary of State is constantly updated. For citizens to get new information, they need to visit different webpages regularly. By making this data available over RSS, you can now get all this information placed at your fingertips.</p></blockquote>

<p>There also a <a href="http://www.ri.gov/rex/feeds/feeds.php?mcat=3">list of feeds at the Rhode Island eGovernment Exchange</a> if you would like to see more. Makes sense, it&#8217;s a great idea. The problem is that not many people are using newsreaders, what use is RSS to the average web browser? This is where having services built around RSS embedded in tools like <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">My Yahoo!</a> can help to really extend the reach. If you already use the My Yahoo! page as your homepage, which a lot of even the non-technical folks out there do, you can add the info from that Rhode Island feed by clicking on this button: <a href="http://add.my.yahoo.com/rss?url=http://www.ri.gov/rss/1/pressrelease.rss"><img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/my/addtomyyahoo2.gif" alt="Add to MyYahoo!" /></a>.</p>

<p>On the Internet at large there&#8217;s an iterative process of breaking information down into smaller channels and then providing more powerful tools to built it back up, and it&#8217;s definitely still going on. Once the information is broken down and marked up there&#8217;s a lot more that can be done with it than simple display directly in a web  browser. The Rhode Island site has some <a href="http://egov.sec.state.ri.us/Projects/web_data_sharing/resources">pointers to a good set of information</a> for publishers interested in RSS.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard that the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/5968">&#8220;Just&#8221; Use HTTP</a> session by Sam Ruby was good (it was the first day of ETech, which I missed).  Not to fear! The <a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/etcon/">slides for the session</a> are online. They talk about a bunch of issues that go in and around trying to use HTTP - character encodings, URL encodings, defaults, case of specifiers, where markup is valid in documents. Working with RSS one quickly becomes intimately familiar with the differences between XML processing as practiced between components of your own application and processing of documents out on the Internet.  Notice I don&#8217;t say XML processing out on the Internet. Apparently there&#8217;s no such thing. So many documents out there are nonvalidating so often that it&#8217;s not even worth trying to process them with a standard XML parser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gregory Blake is one of the latest to <a href="http://www.ezoons.com/2005/03/17/blogger_feedster_spammers_useless.html">complain about all the garbage postings coming out of blogspot.com</a>. That issue was part of the motivation for putting up the changes yesterday to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=464">detect result sets dominated by single sources</a>. Of course that only helps if you&#8217;re using the website for your searches. But there are a bunch of other tools (like <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>) that provide shortcuts for subscribing to search feeds. In order to exclude blogspot all you have to do is append -site:blogspot.com to your searches. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of what that would look like in NetNewsWire 2.0 beta:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/images/subwobloglines.jpg" alt="Subscribe to a search excluding bloglines" /></p>

<p>We&#8217;re actually <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/archives/131-Turning-Blogspot-Off.html">considering turning blogspot.com off by default</a> because of how bad the results are in some areas. Rafer has some <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/archives/2005/03/feedster_blogge.html">additional commentary</a>. It would be really unfortunate to have to turn off that whole domain just to clean up the results. It would get rid of spam, but it would also get rid of good content. There are some great blogs over there (<a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a>, <a href="http://tedshelton.blogspot.com/">Ted Shelton</a>, <a href="http://reinventioninc.blogspot.com/">re:invention</a>, <a href="http://106miles.blogspot.com">106Miles</a>, <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/">Small Busines Trends</a>, <a href="http://jurvetson.blogspot.com/">Steve Jurvetson</a>, and <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/">Anita Wilhelm</a> - just to give the blogspot blogs I&#8217;m currently subscribed to). So my personal preference would be to not turn off the blogspot.com results by default, and ask everyone to bear with us while Google takes care of the issues with the content of the blogspot domain and we tune our spam detection. But please let us know what you think. Blogspot.com excluded by default?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is my post from the plane on the way home from ETech.  It was just a day trip, so we&#8217;re headed back to Menlo Park already.  It would have been great to hang out for longer, but there&#8217;s feeds to get indexed and tools to get written. I wanted to get my overall impressions down. Something that Niall said at one point is that he likes to try to put stuff online that really gives people a feel for what living in Silicon Valley is like. I think that&#8217;s a great goal to have at times, sharing the experience. So here&#8217;s my post trying to sum up what it&#8217;s like to go to ETech. Understanding of course that my take on the whole thing might be biased because I&#8217;m working with a relatively well known company right now, and I went with Russ, who&#8217;s apparently a rock star these days (thanks for introducing me to everyone Russ!).</p>

<p>So my impression going in was that I would have really strongly pointed takeaway from each of the sessions.  And really, I didn&#8217;t find that.  The sessions were interesting, there was good content in there, and it triggered a lot of new ideas and connections. And really many of the sessions were kinda mushy.  If I take a look through the notes I posted on my blog, there is no clear bullet point (or even set of 3 to 6 bullet points) behind most of the sessions that I attended.  There was also quite a bit of just general marketing and information dispersal activity.  I take the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=458">Mobile Computing on the Edge</a> talk from Nokia as an example here.  It was good info, I&#8217;m just not really sure it belonged at the &#8220;Emerging Technologies&#8221; conference.  What they were talking about was really evolving most of the technologies under discussion.  I expected a whole bunch of &#8220;this is a demo of some of the ideas we&#8217;ve been playing with in the labs&#8221; kinda sessions.  And while we did get a pinch of that in the Python on Series 60 session (which by the way I think might have been my favorite) in general it was mostly talk about how to evolve tagging and folksonomies and web services. A good discussion, but not quite what I expected.  I would rate the talks good, but not spectacular.</p>

<p>Now, the people. Yea, that was spectacular. And this is really where I think heading out there with someone who&#8217;s already tied into the group somewhat really helped out.  I had met about twenty of the people at the conference face to face previously, and talked to another ten or so of them online.  But I met about 40 people just because Russ would pull me over and go &#8220;hey, have you met &#8230;.&#8221; Which was great, cause while I have no trouble walking up to strangers and introducing myself, it&#8217;s nice to have a bit of common ground to work out from when first meeting.  And the people there were really very interesting. #mobitpians, and people working on Haskel based open source application server developers and mobile tools, and a whole bunch of bloggers.</p>

<p>So what was it like sitting in the sessions and wandering around in the hallways and lobby?  One of the most important things is so make sure that you have your laptop and the right tools to take part in everything going on.  As I was listening to the sessions I would write down little bits of what stuck out for me for my posts, pull up web pages mentioned, IM with other people in the audience, listen to the IRC channel, and every once in a while refresh the tags pages/feedster search/attention aggregator page.  It really was like being awash in information.  And I know I only caught bits and pieces of what went through those rooms during the day.  But I skimmed out the top 10% (or however much it ends up being) of the stuff that relates to what I&#8217;m doing or interested in, and now I have a bunch of new people to talk to about the stuff.  For the sessions that have notes available from the presenters, or that have audio available at some point, I might go back through and reskim after letting this sink in for a while.  But in general it was the whole experience of skimming the bits and peices out and then trying to match them up to what others had that was the most interesting.  Mostly they were mismatches, I just tend not to take the same kinds of stuff away as most other people do.  I think that&#8217;s probably a good thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We pushed out some changes to the front end at Feedster.  For example, take a look at <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;limit=15&amp;q=slashdot&amp;sort=date">this search for &#8220;slashdot&#8221;</a>. If the results haven&#8217;t changed by the time you read that, you get a hint on the top of the results page saying that most of the results are from a single source.  Namely slashdot.org. And it gives you some links there to either exclude the site, or list only results from that site. The underlying features necessary to do that have been in there, but now we detect the condition and give some links to do what we think someone would want to do in response.  We&#8217;ve been getting lots of feedback that some searches are dominated by a single source, and in general they&#8217;re a source that would better be ignored. So here&#8217;s a way to filter the results easily when that happens. And it&#8217;s discoverable, not a hidden option that someone has to go looking for, it&#8217;s right there when you need it most (hopefully). So does that work out well?  Let us know. Are there other conditions we should be picking up?</p>
