  <div class="entry-content"><p>We pushed out some changes to the front end at Feedster.  For example, take a look at <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;limit=15&amp;q=slashdot&amp;sort=date">this search for &#8220;slashdot&#8221;</a>. If the results haven&#8217;t changed by the time you read that, you get a hint on the top of the results page saying that most of the results are from a single source.  Namely slashdot.org. And it gives you some links there to either exclude the site, or list only results from that site. The underlying features necessary to do that have been in there, but now we detect the condition and give some links to do what we think someone would want to do in response.  We&#8217;ve been getting lots of feedback that some searches are dominated by a single source, and in general they&#8217;re a source that would better be ignored. So here&#8217;s a way to filter the results easily when that happens. And it&#8217;s discoverable, not a hidden option that someone has to go looking for, it&#8217;s right there when you need it most (hopefully). So does that work out well?  Let us know. Are there other conditions we should be picking up?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6484">The Easier, Faster Route to Building Mobile Applications: Using the Best of Existing Approaches and Overcoming Current Limitations</a></p>

<p>Rodney from <a href="http://www.mfoundry.com/">MFoundry</a> presented, I know him from <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a>.</p>

<p>Typical lifecycle: development -> application testing -> device testing &lt; - > porting</p>

<p>You can optionally also go through certification and signing, and then on to provisioning.</p>

<p>Be prepared to buy phones! for testing by the way, you won&#8217;t make it anywhere talking to the carrier without running on the actual hardware.</p>

<p>The MFoundry model is Development -> application testing -> provisioning.</p>

<p>Two ways to get things onto phone, which really boil down to one, you download it.  Called OTA (Over The Air) - that just means you download it.</p>

<p>Available applciation technologies (US) - 75% J2ME, 20% BREW, 5% other (PalmOS, .Net CF, SymbianOS)</p>

<p>WAP, it&#8217;s easy to do, there&#8217;s a lot of support for it, low cost, flexible, poor user experience. Compare that with applications, which have good graphics , threading, caching, and has a good user interface.  But it&#8217;s more expensive, there&#8217;s a lot of training to do, porting, and to update you have to install a new version (compared to an online service, no update needed there).  Applications are for serious developers only, but WAP is a suboptimal solution.</p>

<p>MWorks is the mFoundry approach, best of both.  Development is done in XML and published to the server for download. There&#8217;s some software running on the phone, MRE (moblet runtime environment). Super tiny, 52k. MIL, moblet instruction language, is all that it understands.</p>

<p>MRE &lt; -> mWorks Service &lt; -> Content/Databases/Web Services</p>

<p>mWorks Services.  XML is a bloated format, lots of overhead. The primary role of the mWorks services is compression, encoding. If you&#8217;re interested, W3C, WAP Binary XML is the standard to check out. They call it binary XML in their version, bXML, which gets better compression than the spec version.</p>

<p>They use Eclipse for development, they have a plugin. The other side is the mWorks portal, which isn&#8217;t that compelling for smaller shops, but for the enterprise it&#8217;s very interesting.  Portal still is under development, going public in the next month or two.</p>

<p>The current version has full coverage of MIDP 1.0. Everything available through MIDP 1.0 is exposed via the XML language. That means there&#8217;s a lot that isn&#8217;t accessable from the phone functions, so this is not the platform for you if you&#8217;re doing a game. This is good for portals and data applications.</p>

<p>Use ME for SE emulation, a version of ME running on top of Java.</p>

<p>The interface for MFoundry by default looks much more like a &#8220;media player&#8221; than the default Brew or Java look.  Mostly forms based.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an XML parser, by the same people who did MEforSE.</p>

<p>So how do you develop?  It all start with a .mil file.  MIL is a declarative language. Screen description, options (buttons), http service. You can upload an XSL filter to the server to run to compress the information.</p>

<p>So you have information on the device, you want to put it on the screen.  For an imperative language you would use a foreach, in MIL you use XPath. You have a tag called a repeater, that repeats markup for each node that matches an expression.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in developing, they&#8217;re offering a beta program for early developers.  All the tools are free.</p>

<p>People always suggesting things to do, WS is our way of saying &#8220;Great, those sound like great ideas, show us!&#8221; Also want to test the waters, the way that any project has a particular flavor they want to find out what kind of project the Yahoo APIs will turn into.</p>

<p>obLink: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com">http://developer.yahoo.com</a></p>

<p>Docs, SDK, Wiki, Blog, Lists. REST interface to search can be seen as just the first step, there will be more.</p>

<p>5,000 queries/day/service, IP restricted. Non-Commercial use. IP based so that you can share applications with friends, you should be able to distribute your app without causing the user to go sign up for a login or anything. If you go over your limit, you get locked out for a day.</p>

<p>Example app: <a href="http://buzz.progphp.com/">ImageSearchBuzz</a> (<a href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/33-Buzzing-the-Yahoo!-Search-Web-Services.html">desc</a>)</p>

<p>You can actually get RSS out of Yahoo searches.  The same service that outputs the API results can output RSS.  Actually, RSS is available already for the Yahoo search pages. <a href="http://api.search.yahoo.com/WebSearchService/rss/webSearch.xml?appid=yahoosearchwebrss&amp;query=bitsplitter&amp;adult_ok=1">like this</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently somewhere there&#8217;s a query based on longitute and lattitude, it&#8217;s in the documentation somewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/7020">Erik Smartt</a> about Mobile Python.</p>

<p>Apparently you can take a photo from the script, I missed what the UI looks like though.</p>

<p>import camera
i = camera.take_photo()
f.write(i)</p>

<p>I tried this out with the version of python I have and it doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s a camera module.  Maybe there&#8217;s an update?</p>

<p>The default interface to python is driven by a python script, default.py.  You can hack that to make it look whatever way you want. Erik has a tabbed interface for his version. Showed off OpenGL python also.  The code is ugly and eventually crashes the phone, but it works.</p>

<p>So what if you like scripting, but don&#8217;t like python? Someone else had sent him a demo of Perl 5.8.6 on Symbian.</p>

<p>What if you were running a webserver and mod_perl and mod_python?  With access to the hardware, access to the local from a remote browser is pretty interesting. For instance, browsing from another phone.</p>

<p>Nokia continuing to develop, focus on next gen devices and modules for core device functionality. Location info. Not looking at XML parsers and generic Python functions.</p>

<p>Question about supporting other series of devices.  Will it support series 80?  Erik says he has no idea. The port of python itself is rather generic, done as a port to Symbian.  But in order to finish up the interface it needed to be hooked into Series 60 specific stuff.</p>

<p>Someone asked about a central place to share code, Erik said there isn&#8217;t anything yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6343">Mobile Computing On the Edge</a></p>

<p>The ability to make adhoc connections that make sense to you, late binding communities. Have seen evolution of platforms and technologies that make this work over the last few years. The edge is where unexpected things happen. The center is stodgy. Nothing dynamic and interesting happens at the center.  At the edge you get communities coming together dynamically. In order to make the edge work they&#8217;ve been evolving technologies, like Java. We&#8217;re starting to see the ease of use that makes the edge available to everyone (mom).  Reliability and robustness. Performance systems that can deliver the interactions required. Scalable solutioins, partly on the device, partly back in the server room.  Also want to run disconnected. Management is bringing about tied together systems, no system admin needed, Mom can play with these things without having to be a PC expert.</p>

<p>Industry opportunities. Java, lots of devices and operators out there. Lots of vendors do. Distribution, you need to get your application out to the edge. Nokia has Preminet for that.</p>

<p>C++, Python, Java, Flash, XML stackup on the slide now.</p>

<p>Multichannel connections on the edge. Web service, Data sync, Peer to peer, Event/SMS. Bluetooth, GSM, WiFi. These should switch around as necessary.  As a developer you should have access to all these, and you should be able to tell when you switch so that you can adapt. Security environemtns, like Liberty. SMS is tied into the programming infrastructure, you can tie into events in either direction. Most interesting right now is peer 2 peer. Bluetooth and IR he mentions.. but that&#8217;s NOT all.  We want peer to peer over wide area connections! SIP! Please.  Peer 2 Peer is not just local area.</p>

<p>Middleware on the edge. It&#8217;s made a big difference in the server so far.  New is to do middleware on the device (gaming engines). You can create middleware services (API or background service) and load them directly onto the device. You can put connections to your systems right on the device. SAP is looking at this. &#8220;Exposee the value of the backend&#8230;.&#8221; Game companies also looking at this (IR chat an example). This is a new marketplace.</p>

<p>Managing the edge. Complete management infrastructure.  This is what frees mom from having to do admin.  Real time monitoring. Push and pull software (you can push without user intervention).  Reatime inspection. Remote provisioning.</p>

<p>Lots of opportunities at the edge. Go to forum nokia.</p>

<p>This was much more of a marketing pitch than I had hoped for. Awww man, I was hoping for more.</p>

<p>Cobbled together a lab, teachers loved it, trouble was there was no fileserver.  District has a &#8220;master plan&#8221;, but they currently don&#8217;t have fileservers.  Tried pen drives, but that wasn&#8217;t optimal.  Learned about wikis.  Didn&#8217;t want it out in the public. District didn&#8217;t like to have servers on the premisis.  Would need their own tech support.  Ran across instiki.  Teachers have ibooks, instiki is installed in there, they got a bit of training and configured it to use rendezvous. The work lives on the ibook, the teacher can close the book down and take the work home with them to review.</p>

<p>Teachers and students have been able to pick it up very quickly.  When the teacher shuts down the work is safe. Problems are with the teachers laptop going to sleep, the laptop not being there when teachers are out.</p>

<p>What would be intesting?  Having the lesson plan populate template pages for the class and each student. There is a student information silo however, this is a general problem with any tool you want to use in a school.  SchoolTool is an open source project to create an admin platform for schools. Untimately aimed at developing world.  Web services, hackable. Once you have the services open source tying together a wiki and the online admin info is simple.</p>

<p>SchoolBell is a calendar system for small groups of all types.  It&#8217;s been pulled out of SchoolTool and released on it&#8217;s own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6113">talk that Clay gave</a> mentioned the hackability of cell phones as a platform. Good to hear in an environment like this. Having Python released is a step in the right direction, but I think for the most part people just laugh still when I talk about lowering the barrier for people to experiment with their phones. There are some great hacks that are showing up, but they&#8217;re the exception and relatively few and far between. It&#8217;s not enough to just have the ability to play with this stuff, it&#8217;s making it easy to do so. Lots of people with good ideas about how to make mobility more useful and pervasive currently ARE NOT working on mobility. They&#8217;re doing all the things that would be made more interesting by adding a mobile component. And they&#8217;re not going to take weeks to figure out how to write simple little shims to make their phone interact with everything else online. Lowering the barrier allows those people with ideas (instead of just time) to participate in evolving the medium.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6329">Folksonomies</a></p>

<p>Why did you add it? What did you see that you didn&#8217;t expect?</p>

<p>Tags are more like noting properties than putting in buckets.</p>

<p>Originally built in text file with links, and starting putting a short text after the link, so he could ie. find all wifi links. That was the first use of tags.  And then he built the web version of it, and it was still single user. Later decided to make it multiplayer. Interesting that there&#8217;s behavior of the group that has nothing to do with categories.  Example is the &#8220;toread&#8221; tag.</p>

<p>Missed the question.</p>

<p>Some things have a clear category, for others it&#8217;s very nebulous. Contrasting the need for consensus in wikipedia with &#8220;everyone having their own space&#8221; in del.icio.us. Contrast between people tagging photos for their own use for &#8220;ETech2005&#8221; when everyone else wants photos OF ETech 2005, and the pull between personal use and group use for something like Flickr.</p>

<p>Talk about the &#8220;circle in square&#8221; photos, tags which become a root for community and conversations. Another example was the glow project, pictures of stuff that&#8217;s glowing. Why the difference between groups and tags?  Groups have permissions, different controls.</p>

<p>Canter asks about connecting tags together. How can we move tags around.  Talk about exchanging database dumps at the minimum.  That data is useful in many places. Joshua says 190K tags about, a lot of them single use. Provide tools to allow people to &#8220;trim the hedges&#8221;.  As for shared tags, there are different axis of what you&#8217;re tagging, why, when it happens, who it&#8217;s for. In flickr you tag mostly for you, technorati tagging is mostly for others.  Not all tags are the same thing.  Saying they should all plug together doesn&#8217;t make too much sense, impedence mismatch.</p>

<p>A small group of domain experts can&#8217;t compete with a large group of self monitoring people when it comes to creating a category system.  Paid people also act much different than volunteers.</p>

<p>How much metadata do we need about tags?  Who created it, what tool created it, language, etc?</p>

<p>If you encumber them it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Tags are popular because they&#8217;re easy, have a low barrier to use. Flickr says that analysis is fine, but requiring more from the user is bad.</p>

 Wikipedia addresses the original dream of the internet: people sharing information. The early services worked well for a while. There were some problems though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>quality control</p></li>
<li><p>the information is the view of one individual</p></li>
<li><p>Author fatigue, the author gets bored and the page is a dead spot on the web</p></li>
</ul>


<p>wikicities, 170 communities online, free license. For profit, portion of profits to to wikimedia foundation. Having the information for the community managed via wiki overcomes those major problems that plagued sites like geocities. Relies on the kind of social model that arose from the Wikipedia. Software does not enforce social rules, the rules aren&#8217;t even set down in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wikipedia is a social innovation.</p></li>
<li><p>This social innocation will spread to other areas beyond encyclo</p></li>
<li><p>Software which enables colloboration is the future of the net</p></li>
</ul>
