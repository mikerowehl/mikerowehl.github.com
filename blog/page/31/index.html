  <div class="entry-content"><p>Elle and I are over at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> in Tahoe.  Absolutely beautiful out here. I would be happy to be here just on vacation, and having the conf is just a nice bonus. Last night was the welcome dinner, and I spent a bunch of time talking to <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/">Bill Flitter</a> and <a href="http://www.ericrice.com/">Eric Rice</a>, and I think we&#8217;re going to try to get together a bunch of people for a microcontent BOF at some point.  During lunch or in the evening at some point. So if you&#8217;re interested in something of the sort either snag me directly and let me know (if you don&#8217;t know me already, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/334172/">a picture up on Flickr</a>, and I still look like that, except now I have short hair), or leave a comment here, or send an email.</p>

<p>The first panel is pretty interesting.  <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> is casting the talks, and they&#8217;ll have them available for download, so I&#8217;m not going to provide too much detail.  There are some interesting points in here.  Chris DiBona is moderating, and talking about functionality migrating from the desktop up to servers. Ties together this conversation with service based computing in general.  That was off towards the front. Another good point from Grifter was that switching platforms is just a temporary solution. Windows gets owned cause there are lots of Windows systems and very few Linux boxes, and hackers want to get as many boxes as they can without extra effort so they focus on Windows. If everyone switched to Linux it would get owned instead.</p>

<p>A good general overview, but if you work in or with security there probably isn&#8217;t anything new.  It&#8217;s the &#8220;how do we make users aware of security or make it so that they don&#8217;t need to be aware&#8221; conversation, which is a good one to have, but probably familiar to most who are already practitioners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So obviously I&#8217;ve been pretty busy, hardly any updates over the last month. It&#8217;s not just that I&#8217;ve had a whole bunch of random crap going on either, I&#8217;ve started a company! I&#8217;ve had the consulting business that I&#8217;ve been doing for a while, but this is a real entrepreneurial venture this time around. There certainly is a difference, although I&#8217;m sure that a year ago I hadn&#8217;t put enough thought into it to know what those differences would be. The main difference is that &#8220;good enough&#8221; isn&#8217;t good enough when you start an incorporated business. You need to start with figuring out how you figure out things so that later on when someone asks you there&#8217;s an answer for why things are the way they are. (Yes, it hurt as much to write that sentence as it does to read it). It means that something that would normally you would just slap together a working demo for is now going to take about an order of magnitude longer.  And it&#8217;ll definitely be more frusterating in the short term.  How frusterating seems to depend on how much you have to unlearn in order to successfully self evaluate.  First you must forget all you know, or think you know.  Eventually you realize that you are learning stuff along the way and you just reset your expectations.  Kinda like sitting on a mountain and meditating on the meaning of life for a few dozen years until you get to step outside of time and let all the years you spent in ignorance and suffering recede into vagueness.  In the business version they call this &#8220;the exit event&#8221; instead of enlightenment, but from what I can tell they&#8217;re exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m taking a break for a few days and heading off to <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</a>.  Or Geeks Gone Wild.  Or whatever it&#8217;s called.  I don&#8217;t care as long as there are cool people there to hang out with.  I can&#8217;t say that it&#8217;ll be time away from the computer, cause it&#8217;ll probably just be time in front of the same screen just sitting in a different location. I was looking around for BOF or breakout sessions during the conf, but haven&#8217;t run into anything yet. So I spun through the links that <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> was kind enough to provide me and trackbacked a bunch of people who say they&#8217;re going. Possible ideas for breakout sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mobility</p></li>
<li><p>Linux/Open Source</p></li>
<li><p>Micro-content (seeing as <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/09/missing_gnomede.html">Marc can&#8217;t make it</a> someone should be carrying the torch)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So if you&#8217;re going to be out there and are interested in a small intimate conversation on a specific topic hop on in. We&#8217;ll try to plan something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/09/september-bamf-meeting-is-set.html">September BAMF meeting is this weekend</a>. Details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When: Sat September 25th, 2:00pm</p></li>
<li><p>Where: Dimension 7 Studios, 150 Folsom Street, San Francisco</p></li>
<li><p>Who: Anyone interested in mobile and telecom</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: $10</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll be there of course. The topic looks pretty interesting -  Ray Rischpater talking about BREW.  I know very little about BREW, this should be a great chance to learn a lot in a very short period. Last time the conversation after the meeting was great, and I&#8217;m hoping for the same this time around.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/09/discussion-topics.html">post meant to collect possible topics for discussion</a>, so if you have something you would like to discuss just add a comment there. I personally had no problem at all with the free mingling at the end of the last meeting, but there were people who did. Maybe they&#8217;re just the ones who aren&#8217;t really that into the topic in general, I expected a few people to jump right into that thread and post some comments. I&#8217;ll kick it off after I&#8217;m done with this post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/000525.html">post over at Future Now</a> with a pointer to a new paper titled <a href="http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/SR-869_Infrastructure_New_Geog.pdf">Infrastructure for the New Geography</a> (PDF). I think it does a great job of laying down some of the possible benefits of having geographic data available. Not just being able to include information about where a photo was taken when you upload it to your album, but having a general geographic search engine that operates in the way that Google or Yahoo do for text content. Sorry for the short post, but I didn&#8217;t want to let this one slip by, it&#8217;s definitely worth the time. Go read it. NOW! Git goin&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org">Bay Area Mobility Forum</a> has been going pretty well, but there hasn&#8217;t been all that much feedback or much ongoing discussion on the blog.  So I setup a new <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> for it. For those who haven&#8217;t used it before, the Wireless Ink folks have a site where you can go and create your own website, with the major differentiator being that the site works via just about every mobile browser in a  phone or PDA. They also have an emulator so that you can use the sites from a normal desktop browser. To launch the desktop version just <a href="javascript:void(0">click here</a>;) and the site should come up in a popup. Alternatively you can enter winksite.com/mikerowehl/bamf in your wap/xhtml browser to bring up the site from a mobile device. Through the site you can get to the syndicated feed from the mobilityforum.org blog, syndicated version of other mobile  related feeds, links to mobile sites, guestbook, post notes, and a chat area. I have no idea how it&#8217;ll work out. I figure that if most of you are interested in mobility, you normally have some kind of browser with you and you&#8217;re looking to use it. So maybe we can capture some of those extra minutes here and there and get some other online forms of communication going.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bill brought up some excellent topics at his <a href="http://billday.com/2004/08/21/bamf-j2me-at-five-slides">presentation at BAMF this weekend</a>. The one that struck me the most was his mention of SIP as a major item for future development of mobile applications. Given that right before the meeting I was blogging that I wanted &#8221;<a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=328">a service that respects my mobile device not as a remote and minimal information terminal, but as a first class node within a worldwide network</a>&#8221; that really grabbed my attention. I was somewhat familiar with SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) from the Voice Over IP side. SIP is used in some VOIP implementations, and has been around for a while. I wasn&#8217;t at all familiar with the proposed uses within the mobile realm. For a quick techie overview of the protocols, which should make sense to anyone familiar with basic networking, check out <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/voice/sipsols/biggulp/bgsipov.htm">this overview from Cisco</a>. For information about how SIP fits into mobile applications, check out the <a href="http://nds1.forum.nokia.com/nnds/ForumDownloadServlet?id=5039&amp;name=SIP%5FFAQ%5Fv1%5F0%5Fen%2Epdf">FAQ from Forum Nokia</a>. Just fucking fantastic stuff. They address issues of IM and presence over the mobile networks and programmed handset to handset communication.</p>

<p>&#8220;So what?&#8221; you say. You really aren&#8217;t impressed by handset to handset communication, and you really have no need for messaging or presence. Okay, no problem there. This set of features isn&#8217;t for everyone. But it also enables a whole other set of applications that I think are mostly being overlooked right now - non-handset devices out on the cellular network. We&#8217;re seeing IP functionality merging down into the core of devices like stereo systems, video entertainment systems, security products, and home appliances. Most of these assume they get hooked into a home network of some sort, in general they&#8217;re stuck tethered to your home, and have to rely on a third party provider to facilitate the rendezvous so that you can communicate with them when you&#8217;re not at home (or a lot of technical expertise to make it so that you can communicate with them on your own). The information in the FAQ makes it sound like SIP would bring us a long way toward mobile devices that could act not only as a consumer of service, but a server for new features as well. Sounds like some kick ass stuff. In particular I would love to experiment with IM and presence that was uniform on mobile and desktop systems. I use IM as a major part of my workday, and I would like to be able to sign in to IM when I&#8217;m wandering around. Mark myself as &#8220;available, but on my mobile.&#8221; Sure, some services are setup so that I can use them from my mobile. Take <a href="http://mymobile.aol.com/portal/im/userguides.html">AIM for instance</a>, they have a few methods of using AIM from mobiles. That&#8217;s a step in the right direction, and gives me partial connectivity, but AIM is only one of the services I use. I might be a hot mobile studmuffin, but not everyone is going to switch to AIM just so that they can talk to me. What I would like to be able to do is hook my <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> server up to my mobile device, so that I can sign on to the IM account I want via SMS, not just the one my provider has server side hookups for. SIP seems to be a step in the right direction as far as I&#8217;m concerned, especially with relation to these kinds of issues. Move some of the logic off the gateways and out to the edges, keep the network dumb and have it just route uniform packets. Just like on that big Internet thing, where intelligence at the edges seems to be working quite well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/08/meeting-reminder.html">first meeting of BAMF</a>. Unfortunately we ended up needing to collect some money to cover the space. Michael O&#8217;Rourke was very generous in offering their space at <a href="http://www.dimension7.com/">Dimension 7</a> and we just need to cover the costs of setting the place up, cleaning up after it&#8217;s done, and use of their AV equipment. I looked around some to see if I could find a sponsor, but no one wanted to sponsor the first meeting of an informal group. Given that a bunch of us volunteered our own time to get this set up, and that the presenter is a volunteer, and that the cost is only $10, I&#8217;m hoping no one has any problems with that. Cause if they do I might have to smack them. That always gets things off on the wrong foot so I&#8217;m hoping to avoid it.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the event. I&#8217;ve been following mobile tech for a long time, but being involved with BAMF has got me looking a lot more at fostering the mobile community as a whole. One aspect that I&#8217;m noticing even more than I used to is the gap between the people inside the industry and the proposed users of the services and technology. Technologies seem to get developed and then &#8220;thrown over the wall&#8221; to customers. With the service providers in particular this seems to be true. They do a big roll out of MMS and cameraphone, sit back and watch the numbers, and hope they line up with expectations. Quite often the services don&#8217;t work out as expected. But that&#8217;s okay for big established companies like the service providers (AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon). They have the resources to just pick something else and try again. And there is a problem there as far as I&#8217;m concerned. Relatively random guessing is a bad way to pursue next generation technology. The really powerful aspects of mobility are NOT highly related to the old telecom industry. They&#8217;re really a completely different industry that just happens to be trapped within the existing framework of spectrum licenses and carrier exchange agreements. Eventually the industry will break out of the constraints imposed on it, the market always finds ways to make sure that maximal value is being delivered. I would love that to happen through service providers working more closely with entrepreneurs and startups to explore applications in some new areas. But even if that never comes to pass, I&#8217;m sure something will deliver me a service that respects my mobile device not as a remote and minimal information terminal, but as a first class node within a worldwide network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got back from the first <a href="http://eric.blognews.com/blog/_archives/2004/8/13/123275.html">LobbyCon in San Francisco</a>, thanks to Eric Rice for taking the initiative and getting everyone together. I personally had a really good time. I think it was very successful at recreating exactly what goes on in the lobby of tech confs. There was lots of geeky talk going on, I got to meet some people I know of from their online presence, and ran into some people who I don&#8217;t normally get a chance to talk to. Apparently <a href="http://www.jluster.org/node/266">Jonas was there for a while, but really didn&#8217;t like the venue</a> so he took off. That&#8217;s unfortunate, I would have liked to get a chance to talk to him. But that&#8217;s what happens when you try to do something different. If you&#8217;re doing it right, you should get a reaction. Hopefully there are a bunch of positives, but unfortunately there will be negatives as well. The important factor is that there is  something polarizing and not just a lukewarm mix meant to please the widest audience possible.</p>

<p>In that respect I think it was a success. I&#8217;ve gone to a bunch of different Meetup events around the area, the Weblogger Meetups in particular. And for some of them I managed to get a decent group to attend, though the only really large scale one was due to Shellen dragging a decent number of the Blogger crew out with him. But once I stopped personally beating the bushes to bring people out <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=123">no one showed up at all</a>, and that was really lame. So I started going to organized confs and events around the area, but that gets to be a pretty expensive habit. Most of the low key local events attract a lot of the same audience each time however. And the really interesting part is running into new people, which happens mostly at the confs, and those do tend to really suck cash. I figured there had to be some alternative.</p>

<p>Most of the social tools we&#8217;re using these days do a great job of facilitating conversation and making space elastic. Given that I think there is a place for events like this. Events that aren&#8217;t normally scheduled meetings on a given topic, but more someone just deciding to plant a flag in a random lobby and declaring it a discussion point. It might help to keep the events fresh and the participants from getting bored, allows the fringe events to take place (instead of getting subsumed by the majority vote for a different topic or venue), and hopefully will result in involving people who wouldn&#8217;t normally be willing or able to get involved. These might not actually be LobbyCons at all, but just the reintroduction of a normal healthy social life to those of us who spend way too much time sitting in front of a monitor. Sure, the organization is a bit more strongly electronically mediated (well, not when compared to Japanese teens organizing an adhoc social event) and includes a bit more WiFi while it&#8217;s actually going on. But essentially it&#8217;s meeting down at the neighborhood pub to shoot the shit over a few drinks. Our neighborhood is larger, but the fluidity of the activity should be the same.</p>
