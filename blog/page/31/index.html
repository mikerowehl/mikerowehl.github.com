And Gnomedex has a <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/contact/submissions.phtml">submit info page</a> but they some some stuff about making decisions to publish stuff. So I&#8217;m assuming that isn&#8217;t realtime either. So here&#8217;s a post to either leave pointers to your resources, or submit trackbacks.  We have an IRC channel going on <a href="http://www.freenode.net">Freenode</a>, channel #gnomedex. Here&#8217;s some of the stuff people in IRC have posted:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://my.yahoo.com/s/gnomedex.html">Attendee Links</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The session actually wandered over a whole bunch of different areas. And it was good. They talked about how to provide more info to users, categorizations, enclosures and what they mean both technically and how it changes user practices, will video or audio blogging really change the medium. Ross popped in at a bunch of point with comments like &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s hard to do, but it has user benefits. If it&#8217;s what the users would like, if it would deliver benefit we should be talking about it.&#8221; I spoke to <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Ross</a> for a long time last night. It was excellent to hear from him both last night in person and to have his voice on the panel. Pick up this session and listen to it (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Elle and I are over at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> in Tahoe.  Absolutely beautiful out here. I would be happy to be here just on vacation, and having the conf is just a nice bonus. Last night was the welcome dinner, and I spent a bunch of time talking to <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/">Bill Flitter</a> and <a href="http://www.ericrice.com/">Eric Rice</a>, and I think we&#8217;re going to try to get together a bunch of people for a microcontent BOF at some point.  During lunch or in the evening at some point. So if you&#8217;re interested in something of the sort either snag me directly and let me know (if you don&#8217;t know me already, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/334172/">a picture up on Flickr</a>, and I still look like that, except now I have short hair), or leave a comment here, or send an email.</p>

<p>The first panel is pretty interesting.  <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> is casting the talks, and they&#8217;ll have them available for download, so I&#8217;m not going to provide too much detail.  There are some interesting points in here.  Chris DiBona is moderating, and talking about functionality migrating from the desktop up to servers. Ties together this conversation with service based computing in general.  That was off towards the front. Another good point from Grifter was that switching platforms is just a temporary solution. Windows gets owned cause there are lots of Windows systems and very few Linux boxes, and hackers want to get as many boxes as they can without extra effort so they focus on Windows. If everyone switched to Linux it would get owned instead.</p>

<p>A good general overview, but if you work in or with security there probably isn&#8217;t anything new.  It&#8217;s the &#8220;how do we make users aware of security or make it so that they don&#8217;t need to be aware&#8221; conversation, which is a good one to have, but probably familiar to most who are already practitioners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So obviously I&#8217;ve been pretty busy, hardly any updates over the last month. It&#8217;s not just that I&#8217;ve had a whole bunch of random crap going on either, I&#8217;ve started a company! I&#8217;ve had the consulting business that I&#8217;ve been doing for a while, but this is a real entrepreneurial venture this time around. There certainly is a difference, although I&#8217;m sure that a year ago I hadn&#8217;t put enough thought into it to know what those differences would be. The main difference is that &#8220;good enough&#8221; isn&#8217;t good enough when you start an incorporated business. You need to start with figuring out how you figure out things so that later on when someone asks you there&#8217;s an answer for why things are the way they are. (Yes, it hurt as much to write that sentence as it does to read it). It means that something that would normally you would just slap together a working demo for is now going to take about an order of magnitude longer.  And it&#8217;ll definitely be more frusterating in the short term.  How frusterating seems to depend on how much you have to unlearn in order to successfully self evaluate.  First you must forget all you know, or think you know.  Eventually you realize that you are learning stuff along the way and you just reset your expectations.  Kinda like sitting on a mountain and meditating on the meaning of life for a few dozen years until you get to step outside of time and let all the years you spent in ignorance and suffering recede into vagueness.  In the business version they call this &#8220;the exit event&#8221; instead of enlightenment, but from what I can tell they&#8217;re exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m taking a break for a few days and heading off to <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</a>.  Or Geeks Gone Wild.  Or whatever it&#8217;s called.  I don&#8217;t care as long as there are cool people there to hang out with.  I can&#8217;t say that it&#8217;ll be time away from the computer, cause it&#8217;ll probably just be time in front of the same screen just sitting in a different location. I was looking around for BOF or breakout sessions during the conf, but haven&#8217;t run into anything yet. So I spun through the links that <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> was kind enough to provide me and trackbacked a bunch of people who say they&#8217;re going. Possible ideas for breakout sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mobility</p></li>
<li><p>Linux/Open Source</p></li>
<li><p>Micro-content (seeing as <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/09/missing_gnomede.html">Marc can&#8217;t make it</a> someone should be carrying the torch)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So if you&#8217;re going to be out there and are interested in a small intimate conversation on a specific topic hop on in. We&#8217;ll try to plan something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/09/september-bamf-meeting-is-set.html">September BAMF meeting is this weekend</a>. Details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When: Sat September 25th, 2:00pm</p></li>
<li><p>Where: Dimension 7 Studios, 150 Folsom Street, San Francisco</p></li>
<li><p>Who: Anyone interested in mobile and telecom</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: $10</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll be there of course. The topic looks pretty interesting -  Ray Rischpater talking about BREW.  I know very little about BREW, this should be a great chance to learn a lot in a very short period. Last time the conversation after the meeting was great, and I&#8217;m hoping for the same this time around.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/09/discussion-topics.html">post meant to collect possible topics for discussion</a>, so if you have something you would like to discuss just add a comment there. I personally had no problem at all with the free mingling at the end of the last meeting, but there were people who did. Maybe they&#8217;re just the ones who aren&#8217;t really that into the topic in general, I expected a few people to jump right into that thread and post some comments. I&#8217;ll kick it off after I&#8217;m done with this post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/000525.html">post over at Future Now</a> with a pointer to a new paper titled <a href="http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/SR-869_Infrastructure_New_Geog.pdf">Infrastructure for the New Geography</a> (PDF). I think it does a great job of laying down some of the possible benefits of having geographic data available. Not just being able to include information about where a photo was taken when you upload it to your album, but having a general geographic search engine that operates in the way that Google or Yahoo do for text content. Sorry for the short post, but I didn&#8217;t want to let this one slip by, it&#8217;s definitely worth the time. Go read it. NOW! Git goin&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org">Bay Area Mobility Forum</a> has been going pretty well, but there hasn&#8217;t been all that much feedback or much ongoing discussion on the blog.  So I setup a new <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> for it. For those who haven&#8217;t used it before, the Wireless Ink folks have a site where you can go and create your own website, with the major differentiator being that the site works via just about every mobile browser in a  phone or PDA. They also have an emulator so that you can use the sites from a normal desktop browser. To launch the desktop version just <a href="javascript:void(0">click here</a>;) and the site should come up in a popup. Alternatively you can enter winksite.com/mikerowehl/bamf in your wap/xhtml browser to bring up the site from a mobile device. Through the site you can get to the syndicated feed from the mobilityforum.org blog, syndicated version of other mobile  related feeds, links to mobile sites, guestbook, post notes, and a chat area. I have no idea how it&#8217;ll work out. I figure that if most of you are interested in mobility, you normally have some kind of browser with you and you&#8217;re looking to use it. So maybe we can capture some of those extra minutes here and there and get some other online forms of communication going.</p>
