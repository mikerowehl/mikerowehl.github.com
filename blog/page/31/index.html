  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1461&amp;mo=10&amp;yr=2004">SDForum panel presentation</a> tomorrow about Music and Metadata:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the past 13 years, the web has grown from a simple content distribution mechanism into a vast repository of information and on-line data. As the amount of information available has exploded, and as the number of people using the internet as a source of both information and a way to purchase goods and services has increased exponentially, the use of metadata (or data about the data) has become more important.</p></blockquote>

<p>Early experiments included Epinion&#8217;s reviews and Amazon&#8217;s collaborative filtering. Current experiments include RSS (metadata about which information is new), FOAF (metadata about social relationships), and the semantic web (expressive ways to encode metadata).</p>

<p>In this panel discussion, participants from the bleeding edge of musical metadata will talk about their vision for the future of music, and how metadata will help make that happen.</p>

<p>Fits in with a bunch of stuff I&#8217;m interested in. Why is stuff like this important? Because if we want to transform content from the top-down push that is today into a bottom-up form that looks more like peer-to-peer sharing than corporate content distribution, making systems that allow people to easily find what they&#8217;re looking for are much more important. The current model is that you flip on the radio or walk into a music store to find what you want. The content is pumped out over a number of channels, which exist pretty much just to give you a place to find music when you&#8217;re looking for music. But if the music exists &#8220;somewhere out there&#8221; on the Internet, how can one find what they&#8217;re looking for without reintroducing the controlling distribution channel. In some ways this is an analog of what has been happening with blogging replacing some forms of traditional media. For an example of some of the work going on in the area visit <a href="http://playlist.musicbrainz.org/playlist/moin.cgi/">the XSPF wiki</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brian Cantoni has <a href="http://www.cantoni.org/2004/09/28/sdforum_technorati_talk">a good writeup of a talk about Semantic XHTML</a> given by Kevin Marks and Tantek Celik.  The slides are <a href="http://tantek.com/presentations/20040928sdforumws/semantic-xhtml.html">available online</a> as well. There&#8217;s some good stuff in there. Lately I&#8217;ve been working a bunch with the idea of mixing in additional information with web content. The ideas become much more interesting with <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/2003/01/06/firstEssayOfTheYear">the read-write-web</a> in my opinion. There&#8217;s an elegant layered model for moving user content around evolving. The APIs that started out with blogging, like MetaWeblog and Atom, provide a transport mechanism. Semantic XHTML can provide the structure for those posts to turn a blog post into something more, like an address book update or a calendar event. And those two realms can remain distinct. A standard blog post without semantic information remains a valid post, using Semantic XHTML in some cases doesn&#8217;t preclude using standard HTML in others. For instance the metadata for a <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/MicroContentBlurb">micro-content</a> system could be passed as semantic XHTML in a blog post. Systems used to tend to either require metadata or not allow it at all. New systems, like <a href="http://del.icio.us">the del.icio.us bookmarking system</a>, allow for optional metadata and don&#8217;t enforce any restrictions on how the info is used.</p>

<p>The term for this free-for-all kind of metadata is currently <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/25/folksonomy.php">folksonomy</a>. And like many of the points of interest within the area called social software, it&#8217;s simply a reversal of what &#8220;common knowledge&#8221; computer information management says is an unworkable system. Traditional knowledge said that unstructured metadata for categorization would lead to chaos, you need a strict taxonomy. Del.icio.us has proven that chaos does indeed have it&#8217;s uses, even without a taxonomy the system is still very useful. Traditional knowledge says that any public internet resource needs access control and authentication. Wikis (and the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> in particular) have proven that there are cases where a free-for-all actually increases the rate of production. Even after you factor in time to reverse graffiti and malicious updates. So what are some of the other assumptions that we can attempt to reverse in looking for areas where common knowledge tells us some system is &#8220;unworkable&#8221;?</p>

<p>Well, how about the application interfaces themselves? Traditional system architecture says that in order to build an application you need a set of cooperating APIs, and that accessing remote resources requires something like SOAP/WSDL or CORBA in order to provide a description of the interface and introspection and versioning. But there&#8217;s been a lot of resistence to this view of the network, such as the RESTian response to web services. Most recently the <a href="http://www.jot.com/">JotSpot</a> tool seems to have embraced the idea also. Applications aren&#8217;t bits of binary code linking together local libraries into a strict framework of classes and objects, they&#8217;re transformations and pointers linking togther and unifiying resources out on the web. It&#8217;s a completely different take on the control vs. flexibility tradeoff than is normally taken. Don&#8217;t errect a strict barrier arround your application to isolate it from the world. Provide every affordance and convenience to allow data in any form to contribute. I personally expect a lot more work in this direction over the next couple of months. It just logically lays in line with a series of movements that have been taking shape and gaining momentum for at least a year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> was fantastic. Lots of people to talk to, and I thought the panel discussions were interesting even if others found some fault with them. Being at the conf you hear about a bunch of stuff that it&#8217;s hard to find your way to if you weren&#8217;t there to hear the off the cuff comments or pick up the links from IRC (I really should have logged the channel&#8230; oops). So here&#8217;s a bunch of stuff, some from the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=338">previous page I had</a> and some new stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Eric Rice did <a href="http://eric.blognews.com/blog/_archives/2004/10/2/153034.html">a podcast</a> from the conf. He&#8217;s really into the podcast idea. Seems to fit in as a logical extension of the <a href="http://www.audioblog.com/">Audioblog</a> stuff he&#8217;s doing already. He says a regular show is probably in the works, so keep an eye out for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Taylor has <a href="http://www.free-web-money.com/cat_pay_per_click_ppc_advertising.html">a page to go along with The Future of Online Advertising panel</a>. It&#8217;s not an exhaustive list, but enough to get your fingers into the concepts. Great resource.</p></li>
<li><p>There were a whole bunch of people taking pictures:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterkaminski/sets/16646/">Peter Kaminski</a> - who was also very cool, I got to speak to Peter for a while.  He works for SocialText and I have a lot of interest in the collaborative application space.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ponzarelli.com/blog/Photos">Ponzi</a> - I didn&#8217;t get to speak to her, but have second hand information from <a href="http://kalsey.com/">Adam</a> that both her and Chris really went out of their way to help him when he wasn&#8217;t feeling well. Now that just kicks ass.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://kenlayne.com/2004/10/foto-fun.html">Ken Layne</a> - provides some commentary on photos that were actually taken by <a href="http://marc.buzznet.com/user/">Marc Brown</a>. I didn&#8217;t talk to Ken, but did get to speak to Marc. Marc is going to be in San Francisco for <a href="http://www.ctia.org/">CTIA</a>, so we&#8217;re probably going to get together for a Bird of a Feather meeting. Check out <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org">Bay Area Mobility Forum</a> for more info about that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pjmorr">Phil Morrison</a> - has some great pics up now. We spoke in the IRC channel, but never synced up in the real world. Yet still I feel like we met&#8230; There&#8217;s probably a lesson in there somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.noded.com/noded/">JR Noded</a> - has a few higher quality pictures up. He was sitting at our table for a bit, very nice guy</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There were a bunch of people who were raving about <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Blogware</a>, Eric Rice in particular. I got a chance to speak to Ross Rader about it as well, he provided a nice high level overview. The summary that I pulled out of the discussion is that it&#8217;s a tool based more on sharing than on publishing. If that&#8217;s correct, I think it should be very interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the attendees set up <a href="http://www.arete.cc/godmug/">a Mac Users Group</a> for the conf. There were a hell of a lot of glowing Apple logos all over the place. Personally, I&#8217;m really jealous of the battery life the things get. I&#8217;ve got my eye turned that way when it&#8217;s time for the next system.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had some great conversations over at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex </a> so far.  Here is a by-no-means complete set of links to people I didn&#8217;t know before, but I had interesting conversations with.  Now I&#8217;m going to be reading their stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kalsey.com/blog/">Adam Kalsey</a> - was just a really cool guy in all respects</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.blogads.com/">Henry Copeland</a> - made some great comments during the Digital Lifestyles panel, and we had a good talk about some of the general issues around high tech and its frequent disconnect from reality</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.ziffdavis.com/louderback/">Jim Louderback</a> - great comments about mobile devices being the important platform to look to when talking about the future of &#8220;the digital lifestyle&#8221;.  He&#8217;s in the Bay area, so I&#8217;m hoping to get him to come out to <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org">Bay Area Mobility Forum</a> meetings to add his energy.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Ross Rader</a> - I spoke to Ross a bunch of times too. He had plenty of good points during conversations along the lines of &#8220;well that sounds like a great idea, but ..&#8221; and then normally three or four reasons why what I&#8217;m talking about is practically infeasible. I haven&#8217;t tried out Blogware yet, but now I&#8217;m very tempted to.</p></li>

And Gnomedex has a <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/contact/submissions.phtml">submit info page</a> but they some some stuff about making decisions to publish stuff. So I&#8217;m assuming that isn&#8217;t realtime either. So here&#8217;s a post to either leave pointers to your resources, or submit trackbacks.  We have an IRC channel going on <a href="http://www.freenode.net">Freenode</a>, channel #gnomedex. Here&#8217;s some of the stuff people in IRC have posted:</p>

<ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The session actually wandered over a whole bunch of different areas. And it was good. They talked about how to provide more info to users, categorizations, enclosures and what they mean both technically and how it changes user practices, will video or audio blogging really change the medium. Ross popped in at a bunch of point with comments like &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s hard to do, but it has user benefits. If it&#8217;s what the users would like, if it would deliver benefit we should be talking about it.&#8221; I spoke to <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Ross</a> for a long time last night. It was excellent to hear from him both last night in person and to have his voice on the panel. Pick up this session and listen to it (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Elle and I are over at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> in Tahoe.  Absolutely beautiful out here. I would be happy to be here just on vacation, and having the conf is just a nice bonus. Last night was the welcome dinner, and I spent a bunch of time talking to <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/">Bill Flitter</a> and <a href="http://www.ericrice.com/">Eric Rice</a>, and I think we&#8217;re going to try to get together a bunch of people for a microcontent BOF at some point.  During lunch or in the evening at some point. So if you&#8217;re interested in something of the sort either snag me directly and let me know (if you don&#8217;t know me already, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/334172/">a picture up on Flickr</a>, and I still look like that, except now I have short hair), or leave a comment here, or send an email.</p>

<p>The first panel is pretty interesting.  <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> is casting the talks, and they&#8217;ll have them available for download, so I&#8217;m not going to provide too much detail.  There are some interesting points in here.  Chris DiBona is moderating, and talking about functionality migrating from the desktop up to servers. Ties together this conversation with service based computing in general.  That was off towards the front. Another good point from Grifter was that switching platforms is just a temporary solution. Windows gets owned cause there are lots of Windows systems and very few Linux boxes, and hackers want to get as many boxes as they can without extra effort so they focus on Windows. If everyone switched to Linux it would get owned instead.</p>

<p>A good general overview, but if you work in or with security there probably isn&#8217;t anything new.  It&#8217;s the &#8220;how do we make users aware of security or make it so that they don&#8217;t need to be aware&#8221; conversation, which is a good one to have, but probably familiar to most who are already practitioners.</p>
