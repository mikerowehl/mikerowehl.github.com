  <div class="entry-content"><p>Slashdot <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/06/141221">mentions a paper about applying information theory analysis and economics to the Spam issue</a>. I think the paper raises some pretty good points. I&#8217;m most interested in seeing a system like this applied to SMS however. For a long time I&#8217;ve been bitching about how the lack of peer to peer communication between mobile networks and the Internet is a major hinderance to the expansion of mobile applications. What I mean by that is that there should be a basic and uniform way to send a message from an IP based network to a handset on the SMS network, and vice versa. The major problem there is Spam. If anyone on the Internet could just send an SMS to your handset at will, I&#8217;m sure they would. So there has to be some mechanism there to block Spam.</p>

<p>This Attention Bond Mechanism could provide a part of that. As the paper mentions in section 8.2, their method of dealing with email Spam applies just as well to unsolicited phone calls and SMS messages. Maybe this would provide enough direct economic incentive to telcos to implement some kind of direct addressing with ABM to ensure that it&#8217;s not abused. I think they would see a lot of jump in revenue just from the increased messages IF they allowed recipient determined &#8220;whitelisted&#8221; senders on the Internet to transact without a fee. In my model of the world free news services need to be able to send updates for free. People will use them, they use blogs and community websites for a lot of their information gathering and entertainment. They would use notification services from those sites if they were offered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Gillmor has <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001755.shtml">a post about Lindows using P2P distribution networks to get the Lindows Live CDs out to users</a>. As he states in his article, this is a great example of the positive use of these networks. With music and movie companies spreading fear and doubt far and wide, it&#8217;s great to have an absolute positive example in the business arena. Like others have said before, what really scares the music and movie industries isn&#8217;t really piracy and theft of IP, they are afraid of losing their control of the means of distribution. Once people can output music that they&#8217;ve made by themselves and it can reach thousands of listeners, the music industry has lost their dominance of their niche. If that happens they can&#8217;t ensure the margins they demand and keep the sales numbers they want. So they fight to keep that channel controlled, using piracy as the smokescreen legal gambit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m walking home from a presentation about <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1282&amp;mo=2&amp;yr=2004">Technology Opportunities for Humanity</a>, and it was really very good. I was afraid that it would be a whole bunch of talk about charity work and how we as Big Powerful Silicon Valley Residents can help out the poor slobs everywhere else. It definitely was not that. It was what I considered an extremely well informed discussion about the general topic of businesses providing technology and connectivity to developing nations (or the underprivileged within some developed countries). I think the presentations did a <em>fantastic</em> job of both providing information about the topic and raising some interesting questions. I&#8217;ll mention two of the high points that really hit me.</p>

<p>The first was a comment by Eric Brewer that in order to help a currently underserved populace you first have to network it. Of all the different distribution methods this is the cheapest to introduce into an area. Normal transportion does not follow Moores law, but information movement does. Once you network people and they have access to resources that help them produce more, they can provide the means to expand the other means of distribution in their area. Mmm, an excellent point.</p>

<p>The second came from the presentation by Sridhar Jagannathan, a social entrepreneur who gave some VC style comments about the topic. I wish I could remember exactly the phrasings which he used, cause it sounded perfect as he presented it. The basic gist was that in order to try to run a business which focuses on underdeveloped and poor areas you need to make sure that you keep competition alive. Perfect! Simple! Genius! First you need to make sure that the basics are in order, such as lawfull operation. And once you have an environment that can support fair business you provide people with resources so that they can start on their own. The example used here (and throughout the presentations actually) was Grameen Phone. This is an organization which provides microloans to poor people in Bangladesh so that they can purchase cell phones. The people then pay off their loans by using their phone for business, often times by just selling minutes on the phone to their fellow villagers. The system is not setup so that only one person can own a phone in each village, it still encourages competition between the people for whom it has provided financing. And it nets the organization money because the phone loans are paid back with interest. He stressed that there was a lot of potential to enable poor people and to make money. If the situation is such that the person is now able to both pay you and they are in a better position at the same time then everyone wins. The best way to insure that this is the case is to keep the profit motive alive in those you work with. When they compete they are more likely to be maximally driven.</p>

<p>All the presentations were really interesting, but I don&#8217;t have time to write all of them up right now. I do want to mention Brij Khotari however, who spoke about using Bollywood movies with subtitles in the same language as the soundtrack in order to increase literacy. He claims that using this technique can be more than 10,000 times more cost effective than the traditional routes to literacy. Again, fantastic! I have no idea if the <a href="http://reuters.stanford.edu">Digital Vision Program</a> events are always this interesting, but I&#8217;m certainly going to attend a few and try to find out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jon Udell has <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/02/01.html#a905">a post about the two techniques used to reduce bandwidth when downloading feeds</a>. Those examples were pretty cool. I knew there was a header that could be used to check if a site had changed, but I never looked it up before. This is something I should add into <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">the OPE download tool</a>, presently called PalmTorrent. It would be really cool to have your apps setup so that you could update them online, the way that <a href="http://softwareupdate.sourceforge.net/">SoftwareUpdate</a> allows for, but running through the whole catalog to see what has been updated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/01/29/zaurus.html">An article from O&#8217;Reilly</a> talks about some open source PDA projects. It does bring up some pretty cool points which I hadn&#8217;t previously given all that much thought to, such as being able to move binaries around to different systems. That is a pretty kick ass point if you&#8217;re trying to create some open source tools. I&#8217;ve been working on a very early stage <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">project to get together some open source tools for Palm devices</a>. But that&#8217;s because I use a Palm device for day to day stuff. At some point I expect Linux devices to be perfect for day to day work, but still I prefer Palm devices for the PIM functions. I have tried out a few of the earlier Linux based PDAs, and I&#8217;ll probably end up with a Zarus at some point soon. For now however I have been fooling around with Palm apps. And coming back to do some Palm programming after having been away for almost 4 years is a pretty revealing. The Palm platform has grown quite a bit, as one would expect it to as it matured. But I don&#8217;t think it has scaled very well. There are a lot of platform parameters now (hardware that may or may not be present, screen resolutions, color capabilities, networking, operating system support, and so on). It has become a lot more like programming for any other operating system. It used to have an elegant simplicity, but in order to take advantage of these capabilities programs can no longer be simple. There is a lot that a programmer might have to take into consideration to ensure that their application works smoothly on all platforms, or in some cases to make sure that it works at all.</p>

<p>As the Palm platform moves towards more and more complexity it leaves room for complex systems to move in and grab some of its market. If programming for even the &#8220;simple&#8221; Palm interface means potentially having to deal with multiple screen resolutions, formats, and input methods why not just go all the way and program for an environment which has had these capabilities from the beginning? Especially if the system shares interfaces with a system that the programmer might already be familiar with. It makes the process of learning a new system much more bearable. Palm used to be the darling of the PDA world because of its simple yet powerful design. It did few things, but what it did it did well. What it could be extended to do was relatively limited, but actually extending it was also simple. This is not so any more. Could careful design of the system extensions have left them with a better system? I have no idea. Maybe they have done perfectly, and their system could be no simpler while retaining the functionality it has. That doesn&#8217;t change the fact that I can get a very capable Linux based PDA with more capabilities and which matches my development desires better. Still, I have a Palm now, and I&#8217;m a hacker, so I&#8217;ll program for it. But I&#8217;m keeping my eye out for a nice deal on one of the new Zarus models.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3436289.stm">an article at the BBC</a> with some interesting comments in general about open source. There is one section in particular that I think helps to summarize the case for open source in developing countries quite well:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you spend a dollar with a local company working on Linux, that dollar stays in your economy,&#8221; said Simon Phipps of Sun Microsystems.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;When you spend a dollar with a multi-national corporation as a license fee for a piece of software, that dollar leaves your country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about keeping the money in your local economy, developing skills and developing the local economy to be strong in its own right in a global context.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that is why some think open-source could be the way of the future, especially for developing countries.</p>

<p>I&#8221;m one of those people who thinks that open source is the way of the future especially for developing countries. The tech industry in the US was really pretty stupid for having put so many eggs in the Microsoft basket. And many of the consituents of that industry unfortunately still just don&#8221;t see any problem with the issue (as a sidenote, I think that many of the people I have worked with might actually be Microsoft developed marketing drone bots). It has been known to make life difficult for those looking to innovate. I would be very happy if the currently developing countries didn&#8217;t end up making the same kinds of mistakes. So maybe there is some use to Microsoft these days after all, it serves as a great scarecrow for developing countries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gordon Bell is <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1299&amp;mo=2&amp;yr=2004">going to be speaking in Palo Alto on Feb 19th at 7PM</a>. The topic seems to be a wonderfully geeky melange of old ideas with new implications and forward looking applications. I&#8217;m gonna have to watch Lain a few more times before I go to this one. Anything that feels it can invoke the name <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/bush.html">Vannevar Bush</a> without trying to joke about it is at least worth a look. Plus <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/gbell/">Gordon Bell</a> is no lightweight either. I would think it would be worthwhile to hear him speak, but that&#8217;s what I thought last month about <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=122">going to see Whitfield Diffie</a>, and I was really wrong about that. So this time I&#8217;m not going to make any speculations. I&#8217;m going to see the presentation and I hope it&#8217;s good. There will definitely be bloggage from me no matter what.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent a good part of the day today making some changes to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> in an attempt to make it more usable. The primary change is the addition of the markup menu to allow for easily inserting markup into the document. There are menu items that allow for inserting the begining or ending tags for underline, bold, emphasis, and italic. If you have text selected when you activate one of the items it will insert both begin and end tags around the selected text. This just seemed like the correct behavior, hopefully the users agree. There&#8217;s also an option to insert a link, which also can be used to surround a selection with markup. The link menu item pops up a form for filling in link details.</p>

<p>There are also a bunch of changes to try to make navigating within and between the forms quicker. Handling for the next and previous field shortcuts has been added. Most keyboard based devices have some dedicated combination for generating those events (on my Clie it happens to be Ctrl-p and Ctrl-o, I&#8217;m not sure what it is on other devices). I&#8217;ve also added menu bars to the popup forms. This is also so that shortcut access works. Now you should be able to do almost anything without having to take out your stylus. And if you don&#8217;t use a keyboard you still have some new shortcut options available.</p>

<p>This post is actually being prepared with version 1.8.  So if you see this text it probably means that the new version is being uploaded to <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">the usual place</a> if it hasn&#8217;t appeared there already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Check out <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0401/30/lol.01.html">this gem of an interview with Darl McBride</a>. Talking about the quarter of a million dollar reward that he has put up for the capture of the MyDoom virus writer:</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, the way it works here, Miles, is to pay the reward out means that that person will be in jail. So I guess conceivably they could turn themselves in, go to jail, sit around with their $250,000 and get out. So I guess maybe that&#8217;s the way to make money. Since you can&#8217;t make money with Linux because it&#8217;s free, maybe that&#8217;s the new monetization system.</p></blockquote>

<p>I would hope that most of you out there have figured out just how off base this joke actually is. For most people it takes only a few seconds. But just in case I would like to say that it is possible to make money working with Linux. What Darl seems to be pissed about is that in the new age of computing one has to actually DO something in order to make money. The days of coming up with a single idea and then raping your customers with it over and over again seem to be passing. And in the absence of any discernible talent companies can no longer get by on just being huge. Most business owners are relatively happy about this, it should harbor in a whole new age of efficiency and radical new business models. It will be interesting, refreshingly new, engaging, challenging, and progressive. And this isn&#8217;t just radical communist talk either, or hollow futurism, or blind technological cheerleading. Joseph Schumpeter spoke about the forces of a free market which are both constructive and destructive. SCO happens to be on the destructive end of that cycle this time around. Rather than trying to shift their model to something which matches reality their President and CEO is lashing out like a schoolyard bully.</p>

<p>If I remember the stages of accepting death correctly, it goes something like : denial, anger, fear, hope, and finally acceptance. Sounds like Darl is experiencing anger at this point. Damn, that means there are probably 3 stages to go. I&#8217;m hoping that he wigs out and locks himself in a closet during the fear stage. Maybe if we can find ways to get <a href="http://www.funkyzilla.com/acatalog/Wind_Up_Clockwork_page_2.html">little wind up penguins</a> placed in his path all the time we can drive him over the edge. Like if he found them in his briefcase when he got to work, sitting on the hood of his car, handed to him by random strangers in the street. Not that I really wish the guy any harm, it&#8217;s just that his fanaticism and baseless propaganda and fearmongering remind me of the kinds of attitudes that get people burned at the stake for trying to explain that the world doesn&#8217;t work the way it was previously thought to. Not that I feel he&#8217;ll succeed in the long run, but he has the potential to do a lot of damage on his way down. Sorta like an infant playing with a pack of matches while sitting in a box of TNT. He doesn&#8217;t seem to be sure of what he&#8217;s doing, ignorant of the threat he poses to himself and others, capable of massive damage, and completely beyond control. Fortunately he seems to be destroying his company and his credibility in the process.</p>
