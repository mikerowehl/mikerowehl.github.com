  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/node/view/8468">Linux Gazette article about Hybrid Clusters</a> mentions a couple of cool tools that I didn&#8217;t know about. In particular, the <a href="http://www.linbit.com/en/article/view/46/1/11/">DRBD</a> package looks great. In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve run across <a href="http://c-jdbc.objectweb.org/">Clustered JDBC</a> for the first time as well. c-jdbc looks like a great package, but applies only to databases being used through JDBC (of course). DRBD is a block device for Linux which can replicate information on the fly for any full block device. There are tradeoffs in both directions, such as being able to use c-jdbc in active-active clustering across two or more servers, but with DRBD having applicability to more datasets; but the important aspect is that there are two great open source and free technologies that can be used to fulfill what is a very high-end clustering capability. Also mentioned is a set of scripts for managing failover, called TKCluster. IP address takeover and automatic failover always end up being more complex issues than they look like on the surface, it&#8217;s nice to have working samples to start from. Would be nice if there were some docs to go along with the package itself. This article seems to serve as the <a href="http://www.solidrocktechnologies.com/clustermanager/">project page</a> as well. The code in there seems to be quite clean though, and I don&#8217;t mind working like that. But lately I&#8217;ve found myself spending more time writing more docs for packages I pick up than doing actual work, so unfortunately that has tainted my view in general.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I would have loved to attend, I&#8217;m not going to be able to make the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/">Emerging Technologies Conference</a>, but given that nature of the conf this might not be much of an issue. There&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/hosted.conf?HomePage">a wiki</a> to go along with the event, an <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EtechHookUp">ETech page on the Joi Ito wiki</a>, and a <a href="http://etech.textamerica.com/">moblog as well</a>. There are people hanging out in #joiito and #etech on irc.freenode.net who I assume will be filling in info on the sessions as they happen as well. This is an interesting opportunity to see how well these technologies manage to convey the information from the conference in realtime. It looks like I might be able to get some great info from the conf right as it happens even though I can&#8217;t make it down there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw <a href="http://www.instantmessagingplanet.com/enterprise/article.php/3305451">an article about IETF work on geolocation and presence info</a> linked off O&#8217;Reilly. This is very cool, I hadn&#8217;t heard anything about the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/geopriv-charter.html">GEOPRIV working group</a> before, and it could mean that work in general on the subject is a lot further along than I expected it to be. However, work on standards is not a working project. There&#8217;s still a lot to be done in terms of making a working system, such as getting a good working set of maps. This should prove a very interesting additional point of entry into the subject if nothing else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Howard Rheingold has been running a great news site <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/book/index.html">SmartMobs</a> focusing on a lot of the issues covered in the SmartMobs book. I feel the circle has now been closed. The book was kicked off by mobile usage and pervasive computing, which spawned a site, and has now given rise to <a href="http://winksite.com/smartmobs/mobile">a fully mobile site</a> that can be accessed using a phone, PDA, or desktop browser. This site is one of the best mobile sites I&#8217;ve seen so far, and makes me want to run off and add a lot more to the <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope">Open Palm Environment</a> site. There are brief overviews of the topics in the book, a bunch of surveys, forums,, and a recast of the SmartMobs desktop site blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two articles I&#8217;ve been poking through today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/15/dive.html">Atom intro based on an older version of the spec</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2004/02/03/atom8.html">A new article posted just this week</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Mostly work in preparation for putting support for Atom into <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog">Vagablog</a>. I would like to support both reading feeds and using the API, but that might be a bit ambitious to tackle all at once. I still need to just figure out how to use the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/2004_01_01_archive.pyra#107091563754937970">Blogger.com mapping of the API</a> without using SOAP. That means figuring out the security mechanism I think, and that <a href="http://atomenabled.org/developers/api/atom-api-spec.php#rfc.section.6">appears to be missing from the spec</a>. Hopefully <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html">this article</a> will give me all I need. But first I need some food. It&#8217;s been a hackeriffic day, which always makes me hungry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Slashdot <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/06/141221">mentions a paper about applying information theory analysis and economics to the Spam issue</a>. I think the paper raises some pretty good points. I&#8217;m most interested in seeing a system like this applied to SMS however. For a long time I&#8217;ve been bitching about how the lack of peer to peer communication between mobile networks and the Internet is a major hinderance to the expansion of mobile applications. What I mean by that is that there should be a basic and uniform way to send a message from an IP based network to a handset on the SMS network, and vice versa. The major problem there is Spam. If anyone on the Internet could just send an SMS to your handset at will, I&#8217;m sure they would. So there has to be some mechanism there to block Spam.</p>

<p>This Attention Bond Mechanism could provide a part of that. As the paper mentions in section 8.2, their method of dealing with email Spam applies just as well to unsolicited phone calls and SMS messages. Maybe this would provide enough direct economic incentive to telcos to implement some kind of direct addressing with ABM to ensure that it&#8217;s not abused. I think they would see a lot of jump in revenue just from the increased messages IF they allowed recipient determined &#8220;whitelisted&#8221; senders on the Internet to transact without a fee. In my model of the world free news services need to be able to send updates for free. People will use them, they use blogs and community websites for a lot of their information gathering and entertainment. They would use notification services from those sites if they were offered.</p>

I&#8217;ve been at lots of startup companies in the past, and been through the funding process, but I&#8217;ve never been in on the terms negotiation.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Gillmor has <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001755.shtml">a post about Lindows using P2P distribution networks to get the Lindows Live CDs out to users</a>. As he states in his article, this is a great example of the positive use of these networks. With music and movie companies spreading fear and doubt far and wide, it&#8217;s great to have an absolute positive example in the business arena. Like others have said before, what really scares the music and movie industries isn&#8217;t really piracy and theft of IP, they are afraid of losing their control of the means of distribution. Once people can output music that they&#8217;ve made by themselves and it can reach thousands of listeners, the music industry has lost their dominance of their niche. If that happens they can&#8217;t ensure the margins they demand and keep the sales numbers they want. So they fight to keep that channel controlled, using piracy as the smokescreen legal gambit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m walking home from a presentation about <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1282&amp;mo=2&amp;yr=2004">Technology Opportunities for Humanity</a>, and it was really very good. I was afraid that it would be a whole bunch of talk about charity work and how we as Big Powerful Silicon Valley Residents can help out the poor slobs everywhere else. It definitely was not that. It was what I considered an extremely well informed discussion about the general topic of businesses providing technology and connectivity to developing nations (or the underprivileged within some developed countries). I think the presentations did a <em>fantastic</em> job of both providing information about the topic and raising some interesting questions. I&#8217;ll mention two of the high points that really hit me.</p>

<p>The first was a comment by Eric Brewer that in order to help a currently underserved populace you first have to network it. Of all the different distribution methods this is the cheapest to introduce into an area. Normal transportion does not follow Moores law, but information movement does. Once you network people and they have access to resources that help them produce more, they can provide the means to expand the other means of distribution in their area. Mmm, an excellent point.</p>

<p>The second came from the presentation by Sridhar Jagannathan, a social entrepreneur who gave some VC style comments about the topic. I wish I could remember exactly the phrasings which he used, cause it sounded perfect as he presented it. The basic gist was that in order to try to run a business which focuses on underdeveloped and poor areas you need to make sure that you keep competition alive. Perfect! Simple! Genius! First you need to make sure that the basics are in order, such as lawfull operation. And once you have an environment that can support fair business you provide people with resources so that they can start on their own. The example used here (and throughout the presentations actually) was Grameen Phone. This is an organization which provides microloans to poor people in Bangladesh so that they can purchase cell phones. The people then pay off their loans by using their phone for business, often times by just selling minutes on the phone to their fellow villagers. The system is not setup so that only one person can own a phone in each village, it still encourages competition between the people for whom it has provided financing. And it nets the organization money because the phone loans are paid back with interest. He stressed that there was a lot of potential to enable poor people and to make money. If the situation is such that the person is now able to both pay you and they are in a better position at the same time then everyone wins. The best way to insure that this is the case is to keep the profit motive alive in those you work with. When they compete they are more likely to be maximally driven.</p>

<p>All the presentations were really interesting, but I don&#8217;t have time to write all of them up right now. I do want to mention Brij Khotari however, who spoke about using Bollywood movies with subtitles in the same language as the soundtrack in order to increase literacy. He claims that using this technique can be more than 10,000 times more cost effective than the traditional routes to literacy. Again, fantastic! I have no idea if the <a href="http://reuters.stanford.edu">Digital Vision Program</a> events are always this interesting, but I&#8217;m certainly going to attend a few and try to find out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jon Udell has <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/02/01.html#a905">a post about the two techniques used to reduce bandwidth when downloading feeds</a>. Those examples were pretty cool. I knew there was a header that could be used to check if a site had changed, but I never looked it up before. This is something I should add into <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">the OPE download tool</a>, presently called PalmTorrent. It would be really cool to have your apps setup so that you could update them online, the way that <a href="http://softwareupdate.sourceforge.net/">SoftwareUpdate</a> allows for, but running through the whole catalog to see what has been updated.</p>
