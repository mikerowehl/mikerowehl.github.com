  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tom Peters has some <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/toms_world/observations.asp?id=102&amp;date=1/1/2004">points about offshoring</a> up on his site. I agree with a lot of the points there. One of the ones that I like the most:</p>

<blockquote><p>Workers have the ultimate stake. And thus the ultimate personal responsibility. (Think: Emerson, self-reliance.) &#8220;Workers&#8221;/we/all must &#8220;re-imagine&#8221; ourselves &#8211; take the initiative to create useful global skills, not imagine that large employers or powerful nations will protect us from the current (and future!) labor market upheavals.</p></blockquote>

<p>The common argument that I&#8217;m handed by friends and business relations when I say something like that is &#8220;the average person is incapable of retraining themselves and determining a new career path&#8221;. So now when people tell me that I can just point to Tom&#8217;s list. Tom has a lot more clout than I do, even among my friends.</p>

<p>I personally think this should be a great time for entrepreneurs. If all those people out there have ability but not the direction to be able to take off on their own, it represents a great asset. So maybe only one percent of people need the drive, and the ones who do make it hopefully end up employing the other 99 percent. It would take a while for new companies to staff up, but it would account somewhat for the cyclical nature or business here in Silicon Valley. Maybe there are people who acquire the drive and skills after one cycle, some after two, and so on. Thinking like that, it does make sense that there is so much technology work concentrated in the Valley area. The area doesn&#8217;t just create technology, or even technology workers, but technology entrepreneurs.When I went to see <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=105">Paul Saffo speak</a> he said something about each new generation of Silicon Valley not standing on the shoulders of its predecessor, but building from the rubble of the past. For this area I could certainly see how that works. Each generation turns out a few motivated people with the business smarts and battle experience necessary to drive into the next area of innovation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m visiting with some friends down in Austin. They&#8217;re big gamers, and into MMORPG in general. MMORPG stands for Massively Muliplayer Online Role Playing Game, and games like Ultima Online, The Sims, and Asheron&#8217;s Call fall into this category. They&#8217;re games which allow many people to participate in a shared space at the same time, creating what I consider to be a real virtual world. Something they showed me is a bot style system which keeps your character logged in performing simple tasks, such as casting beneficial spells on friends. I think it&#8217;s very cool, and in general a good sign for the MMORPG market in general. I know that many people have issues with bots because they&#8217;re frequently used to cheat. Many people consider the use of bots to be an unfair advantage, and that they ruin the spirit of the game. I think it&#8217;s much more important that people have crossed of the line from being just simple users to being developers. They&#8217;re looking for ways to extend and enhance the system, and they&#8217;re willing to put their own time into realizing their vision. In terms of system development, this is a good thing. When your users see new potential in your system, and see how to turn it into something more. I think it would be great if some of these games provided ways for the users to hack within the official framework. I think allowing users to hack would lead to a completely different game. Something I think would probably be a great advance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I went to a presentation by Gordon Bell at PARC. The topic of the presentation was a project called <a href="http://www.mylifebits.com">MyLifeBits</a>, which aims to be an implementation of the Memex system originally conceived by Vannevar Bush decades ago. It certainly seems like an interesting project, despite being run under the Microsoft Research umbrella. It actually sounds like a project I was involved in a number of years ago. The project we worked on didn&#8217;t make it very far. It was just too ambitious for the resources we had, and I don&#8217;t think the team did a good job of understanding the direction the founder had (myself included). Seeing a project like this starting to take form has made me review some of the stuff we worked on. A lot of new technologies for funneling data into the system, like cheap digital cameras and GPS for location info, have changed certain aspects of the system in favor of easy use. But a lot of the issues we ran into, like rapid and reliable organization and searching methods, still seem to remain.</p>

<p>I also just started to rethink the way I use my computer myself. I really do live through my computer, I do just about everthing with it. But I really don&#8217;t do all that much that &#8220;normal people&#8221; do. I&#8217;m a hacker, so I do a lot of emailing, online discussion and collaboration, downloading source and patching, and all sorts of dweeb stuff. The closest thing to normal human activity that I do is keeping my contacts and calendar in order with my PDA. And even that probably isn&#8217;t all that normal, PDAs have very small penetration.</p>

<p>But just yesterday I started talking to someone about working on a few more normal human applications. And I have to admit that I am starting to get interested. It used to be that I avoided user applications and really just wanted to play around in the guts of systems. But my recent interest in online collaboration, mobile computing, and web services have drawn me much more into this area. It may be time to dip back into some apps like this, especially if we can come up with some really interesting and innovative usage patterns that need to be supported and then find good solutions for them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got done witnessing my first presentation by Larry Lessig. That was really quite interesting. Not only was the topic engaging, and the commentary insightful, but the format of his presentation was great. I had seen posts about the &#8220;Lessig Style&#8221; of presentation before, but hearing about it is nothing like seeing it. If you get a chance to go to one of his talks, even if you&#8217;re not that interested in the topic, it could be worth it just to see the way he presents. But on to the topic of the presentation.</p>

<p>The title of the talk was Free Culture, which is the topic of his new book (soon to be released). The overall message was that restrictions on media have become more the standard than the exception, and media has become more pervasive. The result is an environment which stiffles creativity, innovation, and the desire to produce. This is one of the major goals of the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, to get more content available under a license which allows for others to create using it. This act of creating new works using existing content has come to be known generally as &#8220;remixing&#8221;. Larry spoke about the increasing scope and reach of copyright law, and said that copyright is no longer serving its main role of encouraging people to create. Copyright law is used increasingly to protect the rights of a very small sliver of society, and at a great detriment to the majority.</p>

<p>So that&#8221;s the  ten thousand foot view. If you&#8217;re really interested in the issues in general keep an eye on <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Larry&#8217;s blog</a>. I just want to summarize some of the points that interested me, and bring up some of the topics that came up in discussion.</p>

<p>Larry mentioned a sister effort called <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">iCommons</a>. It&#8217;s an effort to take the legal parts of the Creative Commons and translate and update those parts so that the license can be applied to works outside the US. Obviously other jurisdictions require different licenses, and it&#8217;s a great project, but what struck me most was that he referred to the project as &#8220;porting the creative commons license&#8221;. Porting legal code, a very interesting concept in general. Why doesn&#8217;t this happen with open source licenses? Maybe it does and I just missed it.</p>

<p>Something else he mentioned was the gap between theoretical law and practice. His example of this was a fair use case involving film. Even though film makers are allowed under the law to include images with a network TV show playing on a screen in the background, this is considered fair use. Often they don&#8217;t do it unless they can clear the rights in advance. Even if the clip would be considered fair use they might not have the money to defend that right should the copyright holder decide to challenge. This leads to the gap between what the law grants, and what actually gets practiced.</p>

<p>The last issue I want to bring up is the relationship between creative commons and the Trusted Computing Group. Trusted computing is something I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=130">wrote about recently</a>, and it would be safe to say that I find the issue a bit scary. Larry said the creative commons is really racing against TCG. I should have asked what exactly he meant by this, because I&#8217;ve thought of a couple of explantions since the talk ended. What I assumed right off the bat was that the race was based on getting enough content out in the commons that people would see the value of less protection before they completely buy into the TCG proposal. Closely related was a point about Digital Rights Management (DRM) being necessary, to which Larry&#8217;s response was that so called &#8220;piracy&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean the end of profitability. He said that at least some music companies have seen increases in their growth since the Napster came into being.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across the blog <a href="http://lemonodor.com/">LEMONODOR</a>, which has lots of info about the Lisp programming lanauge. Most of it is stuff I imagine I would never run across otherwise, and I have been trying to learn Scheme well enough that I can use <a href="http://www.lispme.de/lispme/">LispME</a> on my Palm to do small experiements while out and about. For someone with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative programming</a> so deeply ingrained in their unconscious, it&#8217;s really hard to pick up other styles. My inability to pick up the new style is indicative of me having fallen into a kind of rut in terms of my programming, so now I&#8217;m doubly resolved to be able to program effortlessly in Lisp or Scheme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100391">article over at The Feature</a> talks about some of the implications of storage getting larger in capacity and smaller in size and power consumption. Although there might be some technical errors (for instance, the original Palms didn&#8217;t use flash memory, but low consumption battery backed RAM) I think the insights of the article are right on target. Increased storage capacity will have a great impact on the way that people use mobile devices. I&#8217;m not sure which of the two main usage patterns will win out however.</p>

<p>The two main camps of mobile device usage are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cheap and large storage will allow you to carry all your data with you everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and ubiquitous wireless connectivity will allow you to store all your data online and access it from everywhere.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Both usages have their good points and their bad points. I personally tend towards the devices that allow me to carry my data, but that could of course change depending on the advances in wireless networking. I&#8217;ve been quite interested in the <a href="http://www.antelopetech.com/en/index.aspx?view=i-products_ModularComputingCore.htm">Modular Computing Core</a>, although not enough to purchase one yet. And the use of iPods to store data files in addition to music has made that device quite interesting. I have a friend with a Mac who uses his iPod as a generic detechable storage device, it works just like an external firewire drive, and I&#8217;m pretty jealous of that setup as well.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I would really like to switch from my current pay-per-megabyte cellular plan to an unlimited plan so that I can start experiementing more with wireless applications. Certainly, current cellular data rates aren&#8217;t high enough to support all the different kinds of applications that would be needed to allow a wireless interface to replace local storage, but I haven&#8217;t completely discounted that possibility. Despite the many failings of cellular data here in the US, in general wireless technologies have progressed quite considerably. And maybe someone will have to end run the cellular providers, and setup an alternate network completely in order to get good data services, but I think eventually we will see high capacity wireless networks at affordable prices. Some companies, like <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a>, already have services that allow online data to be used and created both from mobile systems and traditional PCs.</p>

<p>This is one of those areas in which the pendulum might swing back and forth multiple times before settling down. Or it might never settle down at all. Storage and networking could engage in a perpetual arms race, with people carrying their data or transmitting it depending on which technology had progressed further at a given point. And nothing says that there has to be an absolute winner either. Wireless could rule one segment while storage rules another, or it could come down to personal preference of the users.</p>

<p>Note however that synchronization of personal data isn&#8217;t even mentioned in my list. This is the model used by Palm and some other PDA style devices. I think many people would include it as a viable option, but I&#8217;m not. Even for the cases where applications have been well architected to work with sync, it seems like there are always major problems lurking here. I admit that it could just be my biased opinion on this one, but unless there are major advances in the way that sync is done I just don&#8217;t see this playing a big role in future consumer technology initiatives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100392">post by Justin Hall over at The Feature</a> does a very good job of summarizing the impression of ETech that I got. Justin says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The hackers were usually carrying on the most lively conversation over the wireless network. Their conversation sat on top of the conference. The IRC channel carried the words of young and restless conference goers (aside from silent lurkers). During Ito&#8217;s Emergent Democracy Worldwide panel, the IRC channel was projected up on the screen behind the presenters. The commentary of the audience was shown in real time, as a response to the talkers up on stage. Not just the highlighted jests of the HeckleBot, but the entire flow of the backchannel conversation. Moments like this hinted at the start of an integrated conference, the primary real and virtual conversations coalesced around one shared stage. Allowing the text voices from the internet to appear in the physical space was a good start to drawing young and old attention to the same point.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think he probably did a good job of capturing the atmosphere of the conference, and the ways in which real world and online collaboration were blurred into a mass of shared idea flinging. I say I think he did cause I&#8217;m not completely sure. I wasn&#8217;t physically at the conference.  I was lurking in #etech during parts of the presentations, but I was mostly working. Every once in a while if there was  an interesting topic on the schedule I would pop over to the wiki and start paying attention to the commentary in #etech. It would be an exaggeration if I said it was just as good as being at the conf.  But that&#8217;s mostly because I wouldn&#8217;t have been working at the same time if I were, and I would have been able to pay closer attention to all the sessions.  Some of the comments address this issue a bit, but I think that the extension of the community participating in the conference to those outside of the physical conference areas are a key benefit to the method of communication that developed. I don&#8217;t really want to pick nits however, the writeup in general is great.</p>

<p>In particular I love the comment about encouraging the hacking of mobile devices. This is part of the commentary from Justin:</p>

<blockquote><p>So it should be with mobile devices, the panelists agreed. The complicated relationships between handset makers, mobile carriers and their customers, fractured by region and whipped by the pace of innovation, have kept mobile technology largely closed, proprietary. But mobile devices must be hackable to incubate the next generation of innovative human communications. The frenzy of innovative wireless communications applications on the popular Macintosh laptops in the ETech audience illustrated the potential for hackers let loose on a loose network.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is very much something that <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=6">I believe in as well</a>. And I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=24">fully groove to the necessity of hackable devices and systems in order to push innovation</a>. I knew <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/index.html">Howard Rheingold</a> was of the same camp, but it&#8217;s cool to see that <a href="http://www.nokia.com/cda2/0,1083,33296,00.html">the CTO at Nokia</a> thinks the same kind of thoughts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to <a href="http://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/02/mobile_announce.html">this info from TypePad.com</a> they&#8217;re going to be releasing a Palm client for posting photos and text. I haven&#8217;t even made it through posting images from <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog">Vagablog</a> yet, because I&#8217;ve been trying to release features without forking off into different versions for each blog hosting tool. And the sales of Vagablog have been quite slow.  I have lots of users, I&#8217;ve gotten a whole slew of support requests from people since the Blogger API location change. But I have few registrations. The support requests for Blogger outnumber the registered users two to one :-)</p>

<p>I certainly don&#8217;t want to halt development on Vagablog completely, but if TypePad does end up releasing their client it will certainly cut into potential Vagablog sales. As it is, the revenue from Vagablog already doesn&#8217;t justify the ammount of time that needs to be spent on it. So I&#8217;ve got to come up with some kind of plan for Vagablog to either make some more money off it so that I can keep developing it or figuring out if I want to do something more drastic to make sure that the people who are using it and have registered continue to have an app they can use. So this is a kinda warning. I&#8217;ve said before that the lax management of Vagablog wasn&#8217;t going to keep up forever. The future versions probably aren&#8217;t going to have quite a many free posts, and might be a bit of a pain in the ass to use without registering.</p>
