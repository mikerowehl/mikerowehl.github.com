  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to <a href="http://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/02/mobile_announce.html">this info from TypePad.com</a> they&#8217;re going to be releasing a Palm client for posting photos and text. I haven&#8217;t even made it through posting images from <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog">Vagablog</a> yet, because I&#8217;ve been trying to release features without forking off into different versions for each blog hosting tool. And the sales of Vagablog have been quite slow.  I have lots of users, I&#8217;ve gotten a whole slew of support requests from people since the Blogger API location change. But I have few registrations. The support requests for Blogger outnumber the registered users two to one :-)</p>

<p>I certainly don&#8217;t want to halt development on Vagablog completely, but if TypePad does end up releasing their client it will certainly cut into potential Vagablog sales. As it is, the revenue from Vagablog already doesn&#8217;t justify the ammount of time that needs to be spent on it. So I&#8217;ve got to come up with some kind of plan for Vagablog to either make some more money off it so that I can keep developing it or figuring out if I want to do something more drastic to make sure that the people who are using it and have registered continue to have an app they can use. So this is a kinda warning. I&#8217;ve said before that the lax management of Vagablog wasn&#8217;t going to keep up forever. The future versions probably aren&#8217;t going to have quite a many free posts, and might be a bit of a pain in the ass to use without registering.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006221.html">posted info about WaveBlog</a> today. This is the first I&#8217;m hearing about the company and the product line, but it&#8217;s an area that I&#8217;ve been watching intently for a long time. I think the technology is right on the money. Attaching blog updates to places and being able to deliver alerts make a whole hell of a lot of sense to me. Being able to find updates in the area that you&#8217;re currently in allows for a bunch of applications that just aren&#8217;t accounted for with the current architecture. The only part that has me a bit scared is that it&#8217;s being sold to carriers. But given the strength of the technology, I&#8217;m not sure that even carriers can destroy this.  But they&#8217;ve done so poorly with almost everything, it makes me at least a bit concerned.</p>

<p>A Palm based version of the tools would be pretty cool says me. They could pull geo info from GPS hookups rather than relying on carrier agreements. And also, then I could play with the stuff, caused I have Palm devices and it looks like fun ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/node/view/8468">Linux Gazette article about Hybrid Clusters</a> mentions a couple of cool tools that I didn&#8217;t know about. In particular, the <a href="http://www.linbit.com/en/article/view/46/1/11/">DRBD</a> package looks great. In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve run across <a href="http://c-jdbc.objectweb.org/">Clustered JDBC</a> for the first time as well. c-jdbc looks like a great package, but applies only to databases being used through JDBC (of course). DRBD is a block device for Linux which can replicate information on the fly for any full block device. There are tradeoffs in both directions, such as being able to use c-jdbc in active-active clustering across two or more servers, but with DRBD having applicability to more datasets; but the important aspect is that there are two great open source and free technologies that can be used to fulfill what is a very high-end clustering capability. Also mentioned is a set of scripts for managing failover, called TKCluster. IP address takeover and automatic failover always end up being more complex issues than they look like on the surface, it&#8217;s nice to have working samples to start from. Would be nice if there were some docs to go along with the package itself. This article seems to serve as the <a href="http://www.solidrocktechnologies.com/clustermanager/">project page</a> as well. The code in there seems to be quite clean though, and I don&#8217;t mind working like that. But lately I&#8217;ve found myself spending more time writing more docs for packages I pick up than doing actual work, so unfortunately that has tainted my view in general.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I would have loved to attend, I&#8217;m not going to be able to make the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/">Emerging Technologies Conference</a>, but given that nature of the conf this might not be much of an issue. There&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/hosted.conf?HomePage">a wiki</a> to go along with the event, an <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EtechHookUp">ETech page on the Joi Ito wiki</a>, and a <a href="http://etech.textamerica.com/">moblog as well</a>. There are people hanging out in #joiito and #etech on irc.freenode.net who I assume will be filling in info on the sessions as they happen as well. This is an interesting opportunity to see how well these technologies manage to convey the information from the conference in realtime. It looks like I might be able to get some great info from the conf right as it happens even though I can&#8217;t make it down there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw <a href="http://www.instantmessagingplanet.com/enterprise/article.php/3305451">an article about IETF work on geolocation and presence info</a> linked off O&#8217;Reilly. This is very cool, I hadn&#8217;t heard anything about the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/geopriv-charter.html">GEOPRIV working group</a> before, and it could mean that work in general on the subject is a lot further along than I expected it to be. However, work on standards is not a working project. There&#8217;s still a lot to be done in terms of making a working system, such as getting a good working set of maps. This should prove a very interesting additional point of entry into the subject if nothing else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Howard Rheingold has been running a great news site <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/book/index.html">SmartMobs</a> focusing on a lot of the issues covered in the SmartMobs book. I feel the circle has now been closed. The book was kicked off by mobile usage and pervasive computing, which spawned a site, and has now given rise to <a href="http://winksite.com/smartmobs/mobile">a fully mobile site</a> that can be accessed using a phone, PDA, or desktop browser. This site is one of the best mobile sites I&#8217;ve seen so far, and makes me want to run off and add a lot more to the <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope">Open Palm Environment</a> site. There are brief overviews of the topics in the book, a bunch of surveys, forums,, and a recast of the SmartMobs desktop site blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two articles I&#8217;ve been poking through today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/15/dive.html">Atom intro based on an older version of the spec</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2004/02/03/atom8.html">A new article posted just this week</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Mostly work in preparation for putting support for Atom into <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog">Vagablog</a>. I would like to support both reading feeds and using the API, but that might be a bit ambitious to tackle all at once. I still need to just figure out how to use the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/2004_01_01_archive.pyra#107091563754937970">Blogger.com mapping of the API</a> without using SOAP. That means figuring out the security mechanism I think, and that <a href="http://atomenabled.org/developers/api/atom-api-spec.php#rfc.section.6">appears to be missing from the spec</a>. Hopefully <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html">this article</a> will give me all I need. But first I need some food. It&#8217;s been a hackeriffic day, which always makes me hungry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Slashdot <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/06/141221">mentions a paper about applying information theory analysis and economics to the Spam issue</a>. I think the paper raises some pretty good points. I&#8217;m most interested in seeing a system like this applied to SMS however. For a long time I&#8217;ve been bitching about how the lack of peer to peer communication between mobile networks and the Internet is a major hinderance to the expansion of mobile applications. What I mean by that is that there should be a basic and uniform way to send a message from an IP based network to a handset on the SMS network, and vice versa. The major problem there is Spam. If anyone on the Internet could just send an SMS to your handset at will, I&#8217;m sure they would. So there has to be some mechanism there to block Spam.</p>

<p>This Attention Bond Mechanism could provide a part of that. As the paper mentions in section 8.2, their method of dealing with email Spam applies just as well to unsolicited phone calls and SMS messages. Maybe this would provide enough direct economic incentive to telcos to implement some kind of direct addressing with ABM to ensure that it&#8217;s not abused. I think they would see a lot of jump in revenue just from the increased messages IF they allowed recipient determined &#8220;whitelisted&#8221; senders on the Internet to transact without a fee. In my model of the world free news services need to be able to send updates for free. People will use them, they use blogs and community websites for a lot of their information gathering and entertainment. They would use notification services from those sites if they were offered.</p>
