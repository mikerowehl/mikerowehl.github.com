  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across the blog <a href="http://lemonodor.com/">LEMONODOR</a>, which has lots of info about the Lisp programming lanauge. Most of it is stuff I imagine I would never run across otherwise, and I have been trying to learn Scheme well enough that I can use <a href="http://www.lispme.de/lispme/">LispME</a> on my Palm to do small experiements while out and about. For someone with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative programming</a> so deeply ingrained in their unconscious, it&#8217;s really hard to pick up other styles. My inability to pick up the new style is indicative of me having fallen into a kind of rut in terms of my programming, so now I&#8217;m doubly resolved to be able to program effortlessly in Lisp or Scheme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100391">article over at The Feature</a> talks about some of the implications of storage getting larger in capacity and smaller in size and power consumption. Although there might be some technical errors (for instance, the original Palms didn&#8217;t use flash memory, but low consumption battery backed RAM) I think the insights of the article are right on target. Increased storage capacity will have a great impact on the way that people use mobile devices. I&#8217;m not sure which of the two main usage patterns will win out however.</p>

<p>The two main camps of mobile device usage are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cheap and large storage will allow you to carry all your data with you everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and ubiquitous wireless connectivity will allow you to store all your data online and access it from everywhere.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Both usages have their good points and their bad points. I personally tend towards the devices that allow me to carry my data, but that could of course change depending on the advances in wireless networking. I&#8217;ve been quite interested in the <a href="http://www.antelopetech.com/en/index.aspx?view=i-products_ModularComputingCore.htm">Modular Computing Core</a>, although not enough to purchase one yet. And the use of iPods to store data files in addition to music has made that device quite interesting. I have a friend with a Mac who uses his iPod as a generic detechable storage device, it works just like an external firewire drive, and I&#8217;m pretty jealous of that setup as well.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I would really like to switch from my current pay-per-megabyte cellular plan to an unlimited plan so that I can start experiementing more with wireless applications. Certainly, current cellular data rates aren&#8217;t high enough to support all the different kinds of applications that would be needed to allow a wireless interface to replace local storage, but I haven&#8217;t completely discounted that possibility. Despite the many failings of cellular data here in the US, in general wireless technologies have progressed quite considerably. And maybe someone will have to end run the cellular providers, and setup an alternate network completely in order to get good data services, but I think eventually we will see high capacity wireless networks at affordable prices. Some companies, like <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a>, already have services that allow online data to be used and created both from mobile systems and traditional PCs.</p>

<p>This is one of those areas in which the pendulum might swing back and forth multiple times before settling down. Or it might never settle down at all. Storage and networking could engage in a perpetual arms race, with people carrying their data or transmitting it depending on which technology had progressed further at a given point. And nothing says that there has to be an absolute winner either. Wireless could rule one segment while storage rules another, or it could come down to personal preference of the users.</p>

<p>Note however that synchronization of personal data isn&#8217;t even mentioned in my list. This is the model used by Palm and some other PDA style devices. I think many people would include it as a viable option, but I&#8217;m not. Even for the cases where applications have been well architected to work with sync, it seems like there are always major problems lurking here. I admit that it could just be my biased opinion on this one, but unless there are major advances in the way that sync is done I just don&#8217;t see this playing a big role in future consumer technology initiatives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100392">post by Justin Hall over at The Feature</a> does a very good job of summarizing the impression of ETech that I got. Justin says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The hackers were usually carrying on the most lively conversation over the wireless network. Their conversation sat on top of the conference. The IRC channel carried the words of young and restless conference goers (aside from silent lurkers). During Ito&#8217;s Emergent Democracy Worldwide panel, the IRC channel was projected up on the screen behind the presenters. The commentary of the audience was shown in real time, as a response to the talkers up on stage. Not just the highlighted jests of the HeckleBot, but the entire flow of the backchannel conversation. Moments like this hinted at the start of an integrated conference, the primary real and virtual conversations coalesced around one shared stage. Allowing the text voices from the internet to appear in the physical space was a good start to drawing young and old attention to the same point.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think he probably did a good job of capturing the atmosphere of the conference, and the ways in which real world and online collaboration were blurred into a mass of shared idea flinging. I say I think he did cause I&#8217;m not completely sure. I wasn&#8217;t physically at the conference.  I was lurking in #etech during parts of the presentations, but I was mostly working. Every once in a while if there was  an interesting topic on the schedule I would pop over to the wiki and start paying attention to the commentary in #etech. It would be an exaggeration if I said it was just as good as being at the conf.  But that&#8217;s mostly because I wouldn&#8217;t have been working at the same time if I were, and I would have been able to pay closer attention to all the sessions.  Some of the comments address this issue a bit, but I think that the extension of the community participating in the conference to those outside of the physical conference areas are a key benefit to the method of communication that developed. I don&#8217;t really want to pick nits however, the writeup in general is great.</p>

<p>In particular I love the comment about encouraging the hacking of mobile devices. This is part of the commentary from Justin:</p>

<blockquote><p>So it should be with mobile devices, the panelists agreed. The complicated relationships between handset makers, mobile carriers and their customers, fractured by region and whipped by the pace of innovation, have kept mobile technology largely closed, proprietary. But mobile devices must be hackable to incubate the next generation of innovative human communications. The frenzy of innovative wireless communications applications on the popular Macintosh laptops in the ETech audience illustrated the potential for hackers let loose on a loose network.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is very much something that <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=6">I believe in as well</a>. And I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=24">fully groove to the necessity of hackable devices and systems in order to push innovation</a>. I knew <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/index.html">Howard Rheingold</a> was of the same camp, but it&#8217;s cool to see that <a href="http://www.nokia.com/cda2/0,1083,33296,00.html">the CTO at Nokia</a> thinks the same kind of thoughts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to <a href="http://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/02/mobile_announce.html">this info from TypePad.com</a> they&#8217;re going to be releasing a Palm client for posting photos and text. I haven&#8217;t even made it through posting images from <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog">Vagablog</a> yet, because I&#8217;ve been trying to release features without forking off into different versions for each blog hosting tool. And the sales of Vagablog have been quite slow.  I have lots of users, I&#8217;ve gotten a whole slew of support requests from people since the Blogger API location change. But I have few registrations. The support requests for Blogger outnumber the registered users two to one :-)</p>

<p>I certainly don&#8217;t want to halt development on Vagablog completely, but if TypePad does end up releasing their client it will certainly cut into potential Vagablog sales. As it is, the revenue from Vagablog already doesn&#8217;t justify the ammount of time that needs to be spent on it. So I&#8217;ve got to come up with some kind of plan for Vagablog to either make some more money off it so that I can keep developing it or figuring out if I want to do something more drastic to make sure that the people who are using it and have registered continue to have an app they can use. So this is a kinda warning. I&#8217;ve said before that the lax management of Vagablog wasn&#8217;t going to keep up forever. The future versions probably aren&#8217;t going to have quite a many free posts, and might be a bit of a pain in the ass to use without registering.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006221.html">posted info about WaveBlog</a> today. This is the first I&#8217;m hearing about the company and the product line, but it&#8217;s an area that I&#8217;ve been watching intently for a long time. I think the technology is right on the money. Attaching blog updates to places and being able to deliver alerts make a whole hell of a lot of sense to me. Being able to find updates in the area that you&#8217;re currently in allows for a bunch of applications that just aren&#8217;t accounted for with the current architecture. The only part that has me a bit scared is that it&#8217;s being sold to carriers. But given the strength of the technology, I&#8217;m not sure that even carriers can destroy this.  But they&#8217;ve done so poorly with almost everything, it makes me at least a bit concerned.</p>

<p>A Palm based version of the tools would be pretty cool says me. They could pull geo info from GPS hookups rather than relying on carrier agreements. And also, then I could play with the stuff, caused I have Palm devices and it looks like fun ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/node/view/8468">Linux Gazette article about Hybrid Clusters</a> mentions a couple of cool tools that I didn&#8217;t know about. In particular, the <a href="http://www.linbit.com/en/article/view/46/1/11/">DRBD</a> package looks great. In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve run across <a href="http://c-jdbc.objectweb.org/">Clustered JDBC</a> for the first time as well. c-jdbc looks like a great package, but applies only to databases being used through JDBC (of course). DRBD is a block device for Linux which can replicate information on the fly for any full block device. There are tradeoffs in both directions, such as being able to use c-jdbc in active-active clustering across two or more servers, but with DRBD having applicability to more datasets; but the important aspect is that there are two great open source and free technologies that can be used to fulfill what is a very high-end clustering capability. Also mentioned is a set of scripts for managing failover, called TKCluster. IP address takeover and automatic failover always end up being more complex issues than they look like on the surface, it&#8217;s nice to have working samples to start from. Would be nice if there were some docs to go along with the package itself. This article seems to serve as the <a href="http://www.solidrocktechnologies.com/clustermanager/">project page</a> as well. The code in there seems to be quite clean though, and I don&#8217;t mind working like that. But lately I&#8217;ve found myself spending more time writing more docs for packages I pick up than doing actual work, so unfortunately that has tainted my view in general.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I would have loved to attend, I&#8217;m not going to be able to make the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/">Emerging Technologies Conference</a>, but given that nature of the conf this might not be much of an issue. There&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/hosted.conf?HomePage">a wiki</a> to go along with the event, an <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EtechHookUp">ETech page on the Joi Ito wiki</a>, and a <a href="http://etech.textamerica.com/">moblog as well</a>. There are people hanging out in #joiito and #etech on irc.freenode.net who I assume will be filling in info on the sessions as they happen as well. This is an interesting opportunity to see how well these technologies manage to convey the information from the conference in realtime. It looks like I might be able to get some great info from the conf right as it happens even though I can&#8217;t make it down there.</p>
