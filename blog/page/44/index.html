  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just registered for <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</a>. Yea, I&#8217;m a loser, I&#8217;ve never been to one before. Certainly sounds kick ass, and it&#8217;s in Tahoe, and there&#8217;s a three day open bar, and people all over the place with computers and network access. See, I&#8217;m getting excited already and the conf is still six months off. Pre-reg ends in just a few days however.. although I&#8217;m not sure what that means exactly. What happens after pre-reg ends? Hard to say, so I just registered. Probably not the smartest way to handle it. But then again spending three days at an open bar with a bunch of geeks isn&#8217;t exactly a safe diversion either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Textually.com <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/003405.htm">reports on a new interactive billboard installed by Yahoo! to promote their reworked auto site</a>. The <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/creative/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000471117">full article is at AdWeek</a>, but it does little to answer my main question. The sign looks like a pretty cool idea. It&#8217;ll certainly attract some attention, and it&#8217;s novel enough that people might visit it just to see how it comes off. But there are mentions of RFIB in both the excerpt and in the longer article. How is RFIB being used for the Yahoo! application? I get the impression it isn&#8217;t being used at all. It seems like it&#8217;s just something that the sign maker wants to pimp:</p>

<blockquote><p>The company&#8217;s sign technology, called RFIB and similar to toll roads&#8217; Easy-Pass systems, could be expanded to customized billboards in the near future, according to John Mayo-Smith, vice president of technology at R/GA. For example, a digital billboard might be programmed to have a different image depending on whether a car or a motorcycle passed it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hmm.. interesting technology to drag out during the International Automotive Show. Are they there to try to get manufacturers to embed RFIB tags in new models so that advertising can be targeted at vehicles as they pass? Makes too much sense to be ignored. With everyone screaming about RFID being used in retail locations for the items they&#8217;re purchasing, I can&#8217;t see anyone being to happy about getting a tracking device embedded in their vehicle. Passive RFID tags work over VERY short range (for most of the tags being used in retail applications, about 1 meter), however the EZpass style tags work over much longer range. And if they&#8217;re talking about using a read from the tag to drive a creative on a sign by the side of the road, I have to imagine that the read range is measured in tens of meters.</p>

<p>So what exactly is RFIB? A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=RFIB&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Google search for the term &#8220;RFIB&#8221;</a> yeilded nothing that seemed to be related. The <a href="http://www.rga.com">R/GA corporate website</a>, a flash site with no alternative view that I could find, yeilded no useful info. There might be some info in there, but there&#8217;s no search function and the site is structured to assure that no external searches work. If you want a nefarious tracking application to rally against, I would pick this one. That said, I still think the interactive billboard is a pretty cool idea. I&#8217;m just not sure that I like the RFIB aspect of it. Especially if someone is out there lobbying automakers to install it without making any of the details public.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across two computer programming books with their full text available online: <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-1.html">Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days</a> and <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. I&#8217;ve only skimmed through each of them very briefly, but I personally am going to start on the teach yourself Scheme book. While I am a pretty hard core geek, I do know that I&#8217;m pretty far behind the curve in terms of the Scheme style of programming. Unfortunately there are a lot of programmers who never realize when they&#8217;re in similar situations. Learning new techniques shouldn&#8217;t stop when you get your degree or certification. So if you&#8217;re a professional programmer I urge you to at least take a look over this stuff, especially if you&#8217;re not familiar with functional programming. I know most will look over at the books and say something like &#8220;this is dumb, my language can do all of this stuff much more easily.&#8221; Resist that urge. For those of us who come from an imperitive or object oriented background (C, C++, Pascal, Java, etc) there is a bunch to be learned from the style. What got me to go back and look at the stuff was <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">an article by Paul Graham about using Lisp for web programming</a>. In the article he quotes Eric Raymond:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that statement to be eerily accurate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I got my new <a href="http://www.technorati.com/profile/miker">Technorati Profile</a> kicking, and I&#8217;m feeling pretty spiffy. But I notice that when I upload a picture it&#8217;s all smushed and mangled, and that I can&#8217;t remove the image so I just have to put up one of Ed instead, and that their javascript inclusion snippet isn&#8217;t valid XHTML. So out it comes again, and I shove back in some corrected XHTML, but this time without the image. Hopefully that won&#8217;t screw things up. I emailed feedback, we&#8217;ll see what they have to say about my oddball requests. Overall, it&#8217;s not that big of a deal. I claimed the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">Link Blog</a> also, and while I was at it realized that thing is nowhere near XHTML. So I guess I got something to do tomorrow as well.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the deal with Technorati, cause I shouldn&#8217;t assume everyone knows about these things. <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> is a website that keeps track of which blogs are linking to which other blogs, which is cool for blog writers cause we&#8217;re frequently wondering about who is paying attention to the stuff we&#8217;re writing. From what I&#8217;ve been able to tell so far, Technorati seems to watch the blog update ping services like <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">Weblogs.com</a> and <a href="http://blo.gs/">blo.gs</a> to find the list of blogs to parse. I&#8217;m assuming this cause I know of a few blogs that have linked to Bitsplitter, but I don&#8217;t see on my inbound links list. When I asked the authors, they all said they didn&#8217;t ping weblogs.com or any other service. So, that&#8217;s something to keep in mind if you have a blog and you would like to bootstrap it into the larger world. It seems like those weblog change posting services have so many links that no one would notice your update anyway, but they&#8217;re not just for human use apparently. Pinging the update services will also get your link into services like Technorati and news aggregator services. That&#8217;s my tip for the day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And here you have it, the updated Bitsplitter Blog. The minimalist view is still the default, but now featuring such coolness as <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitsplitter.net%2Fblog%2F">valid XHTML</a>, <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">valid CSS</a>, and a <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitsplitter.net%2Fblog%2Fwp-rss2.php">valid RSS2 feed</a>. And this time instead of destroying the normal setup, I left the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/desktop.php">desktop version available</a> as well. So those of you who are into that kind of thing should be made a little happier.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=204">test posting from Vagablog</a> worked, but I got the standard XML declaration error instead of a success message. It turns out that this has been fixed for real in CVS for <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, but the 1.0.2 version still barfs some stuff that it shouldn&#8217;t into the XMLRPC output. If you want to fix it on your own, and you know what you&#8217;re doing, find the wp_set_post_cats() function in xmlrpc.php. Go to the part that reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>// First the old categories
$old_categories = $wpdb->get_col(&#8220;SELECT category_id FROM $tablepost2cat WHERE post_id = $post_ID&#8221;);</p></blockquote>

<p>Just after the assignment of $old_categories add the lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>if ( !isset( $old_categories ) ) {
$old_categories = array();
}</p></blockquote>

<p>That should take care of it for now. The 1.0.3 release should have the fixes from CVS, so that should be the last of that issue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Novell has announced a very strong move recently, as <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1552521,00.asp">reported in eWeek</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/36455.html">The Register</a>. Novell has decided to take their flagship product and rearrange it so that it runs on top of the Linux kernel:</p>

<blockquote><p>Novell yesterday underlined its commitment to open source technologies by confirming that its flagship network services platform will run on either NetWare or Linux kernels.</p></blockquote>

<p>Given the large revenue of Novell, people say this should serve as a pretty big boost for open source in general. I think I agree with that, but I wasn&#8217;t too sure why. I&#8217;ve been at companies before who refused to use Linux for their solutions. The managers and executives would say that the reasons were lack of support or that the operating system was untested or that it would be viewed as an unstable base by customers. The general argument I heard from them (and from others at the time, trade magazines and websites) was that it &#8220;just wasn&#8217;t good business&#8221; to rely on something as radically new as Linux. No matter how good the technical end looked, and no matter how appealing the cost and flexibility were, there were other negative factors that went into forming a business around Linux. The negative factors always won, and who was I to say otherwise? I knew little about &#8220;business&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m starting to learn a whole lot about business. I&#8217;ve learned enough about business to know that there are always reasons to argue against doing something new.  &#8220;Good business&#8221; is not identifying the status-quo, finding problems with new approaches, and then using those problems to beat down any new ideas. &#8220;Good business&#8221; is finding the better solution, figuring out all the obstacles thrown up by entrenched practice and outside perception, and then drafting and executing a plan to overcome them. So kudos to Novell, they seem to be trying that. I really hope it works out as a whole. But the attitude about the effects of the move by Novell is indicative of a larger problem. Why does it take Novell jumping in for others to be willing to pursue the better technology? Probably because most companies are running on seriously flawed methodologies. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter">Schumpeter</a> indicated, most of them are still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">built for mediocrity and eventual extinction</a>. Open source represents a major discontinuity in terms of the enterprise software arena. Yet still businesses are looking for ways to map the new techniques one-for-one into their old models. When what they should be looking for are new models, and the new competitors that those new models will bring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MobileCommunityDesign has a <a href="http://www.mobilecommunitydesign.com/archives/000040.php">post about the Urban Tapestries project</a>. The report linked is interesting, they seem to give the honest feedback from what users said. Not too surprizingly many users said they would not use the system on their own yet. This is something that&#8217;s to be expected with the first few trials of a radically new service however. Not only does the technology look cool, but their techniques such as <a href="http://www.proboscis.org.uk/urbantapestries/bodystorming.html">bodystorming</a> and their <a href="http://www.proboscis.org.uk/urbantapestries/prototype.html">approach to prototyping and experimentation</a> are very interesting to read about.</p>
