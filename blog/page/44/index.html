  <div class="entry-content"><p>Novell has announced a very strong move recently, as <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1552521,00.asp">reported in eWeek</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/36455.html">The Register</a>. Novell has decided to take their flagship product and rearrange it so that it runs on top of the Linux kernel:</p>

<blockquote><p>Novell yesterday underlined its commitment to open source technologies by confirming that its flagship network services platform will run on either NetWare or Linux kernels.</p></blockquote>

<p>Given the large revenue of Novell, people say this should serve as a pretty big boost for open source in general. I think I agree with that, but I wasn&#8217;t too sure why. I&#8217;ve been at companies before who refused to use Linux for their solutions. The managers and executives would say that the reasons were lack of support or that the operating system was untested or that it would be viewed as an unstable base by customers. The general argument I heard from them (and from others at the time, trade magazines and websites) was that it &#8220;just wasn&#8217;t good business&#8221; to rely on something as radically new as Linux. No matter how good the technical end looked, and no matter how appealing the cost and flexibility were, there were other negative factors that went into forming a business around Linux. The negative factors always won, and who was I to say otherwise? I knew little about &#8220;business&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m starting to learn a whole lot about business. I&#8217;ve learned enough about business to know that there are always reasons to argue against doing something new.  &#8220;Good business&#8221; is not identifying the status-quo, finding problems with new approaches, and then using those problems to beat down any new ideas. &#8220;Good business&#8221; is finding the better solution, figuring out all the obstacles thrown up by entrenched practice and outside perception, and then drafting and executing a plan to overcome them. So kudos to Novell, they seem to be trying that. I really hope it works out as a whole. But the attitude about the effects of the move by Novell is indicative of a larger problem. Why does it take Novell jumping in for others to be willing to pursue the better technology? Probably because most companies are running on seriously flawed methodologies. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter">Schumpeter</a> indicated, most of them are still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">built for mediocrity and eventual extinction</a>. Open source represents a major discontinuity in terms of the enterprise software arena. Yet still businesses are looking for ways to map the new techniques one-for-one into their old models. When what they should be looking for are new models, and the new competitors that those new models will bring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MobileCommunityDesign has a <a href="http://www.mobilecommunitydesign.com/archives/000040.php">post about the Urban Tapestries project</a>. The report linked is interesting, they seem to give the honest feedback from what users said. Not too surprizingly many users said they would not use the system on their own yet. This is something that&#8217;s to be expected with the first few trials of a radically new service however. Not only does the technology look cool, but their techniques such as <a href="http://www.proboscis.org.uk/urbantapestries/bodystorming.html">bodystorming</a> and their <a href="http://www.proboscis.org.uk/urbantapestries/prototype.html">approach to prototyping and experimentation</a> are very interesting to read about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100469&amp;ref=617603">post from The Feature</a> indicates that the mobile market might be waking up to presenting better value propositions to users. The signs mentioned in the article are great, and I&#8217;m happy to hear about it. But I would personally like to see many of the crappy mobile service commercials (here in the US) turn into real marketing attempts. The way that data services are presented tries way to hard to just be hip. People in the most ridiculous situations sending text messages and images to each other, no description of mobile access to the web or other services. Being cute and somewhat flippant is fine, an occasional off-the-wall commercial is fine. Spice things up a bit, I&#8217;m down with that. But the last serious mobile data services commercials I can remember seeing are from when <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/05/22/mmode/">mLife</a> hadn&#8217;t yet failed horribly. Is everyone still reeling from that flop? Sure, it was a spectactular failure, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the only way to sell mobile services is by telling jokes or appealing to the youngest crowd you can find. Maybe now that handset providers have gotten over selling acronyms the service providers will get over selling humour.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">an interesting debate</a> going on within the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> and <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> communities.

<p>This is essentially a debate about how to go forward with development of an open source desktop system, in particular what technologies and languages to use in implementing the system itself. I think it&#8217;s interesting to see all the issues that go into making a decision such as this, as of course there are both technical and nontechnical factors.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a>, I would suggest at least skimming the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/faq.html">FAQ</a>. Compatibility with the .NET system appears to have heavily influenced much of the discussion so far. The planned operating system Longhorn (a Microsoft product) apparently exposes .NET interfaces and plugin APIs at many different levels of the OS. It&#8217;s an excellent idea for a desktop system, but it&#8217;s also not a new idea. Why start playing catchup on this concept because Microsoft has decided to implement it? If we want a pluggable desktop system which exposes all user information as objects I would personally opt for building one without waiting to see what Microsoft has done. Compatibility with Longhorn is important, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the only way to get advanced desktop features is by waiting to copy a commercial product. I really hope it&#8217;s not the only way at least. But with the US patent system in the state that it&#8217;s in, maybe that is the only viable option.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brian Cantoni has a <a href="http://www.cantoni.org/2004/03/12/moblog">post about mo:Blog</a>, a mobile blogging application that looks to be a lot more feature rich than my <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> application. I&#8217;ll have to fool around with it at some point, it says it can even upload binary attachments (like images). That definitely kicks ass in general, but it does mean some pretty stiff competition for Vagablog. I&#8217;ve been sorta wavering on the whole issue of adding Atom support into Vagablog. It would be a cool hack, but there&#8217;s no economic incentive. Vagablog just isn&#8217;t making enough money to make it worthwhile. I might keep Vagablog at the slim and simple (and cheap) end of the scale. So for those of you looking for advanced capabilities like image uploading and post editing, check out <a href="http://www.tektonica.com/projects/moblog/">mo:Blog</a>. It seems like it&#8217;s already quite advanced, and should fit the bill for those of you who said you were looking for some more features in a Palm weblogging app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Larry Lessig <a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/trends/04/03/17/156205.shtml?tid=137&amp;tid=147">gave a presentation on why the protection of IP is important for the creative process</a>. It sounds like it was the same set of material that <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=167">he tried out on us over at Stanford</a>. Lessig has a new book on the market called <a href="http://the-future-of-ideas.com/"><strong>The Future of Ideas</strong></a>, something I&#8217;m certainly going to pick up and read. There was a quote I particularly liked in there:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let the commercial interests compete on execution of the ideas; that&#8217;s the free enterprise system,&#8221; Lessig said. &#8220;But the creators need to maintain the freedom to distribute their ideas any way they want. They shouldn&#8217;t be bogged down by 20-year copyrights and other old restrictions that bottle up good ideas&#8221; [and] keep them on the shelf, Lessig said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which reminded me that the mobile publishing site <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> has <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?blog_id=1208">added support for marking content as covered by Creative Commons licenses</a>. So of course I quickly ran out and marked <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/unrooted">the Unrooted mobile site</a> and <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope">the Open Palm Environment mobile site</a> as wonderfully liberating <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/">ShareAlike</a> content. I actually think I might feel another WINKsite coming on&#8230; I feel the urge to experiment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I put a new area up at Bitsplitter, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">Bitsplitter Link Blog</a>. &#8220;So what&#8217;s the difference between the normal blog and the link blog?&#8221; one might be expected to ask. Well the link blog is for short mentions of things that I want to come back and look at when I have some more time, the main blog is for commentary and things that I know I was interested in and I want to share. There is an additional aspect to the link blog however, it&#8217;s actually more PDA friendly than the normal blog. <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">This blog that you&#8217;re reading now</a> is minimally formatted so that it displays well on PDA screens, but the articles that I link to aren&#8217;t always good for small screens. On the other hand, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">link blog</a> is both PDA friendly and links to items that are PDA friendly. The link blog came about because I wanted a way to get certain links that I was bookmarking to transfer over to my PDA so I could read them when I wasn&#8217;t sitting at my desktop. Rather than making up something new, I decided to just put them in a blog. I didn&#8217;t want to clutter up the main Bitsplitter blog with a bunch of junk that I wasn&#8217;t even sure I would be interested in. So I started a whole new area.</p>
