  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things I hear pretty often is &#8220;sometimes you just have to go with the lesser evil&#8221;. Now, granted, I probably tend to get myself into situations that would spark that remark more often than is normal. But I&#8217;m sure most of you have heard it somewhere along the line. It&#8217;s not like that really solves anything though. Evil is supposed to be all trixie and insidious. Make you think you&#8217;re doing good when you&#8217;re really doing evil. The ol&#8217; bait and switch. If I knew which was the lesser evil I wouldn&#8217;t be pondering in the first place. So instead of pondering I just built an app to help: <a href="http://lesserevil.ning.com">Lesser Evil</a>. So that I can find out what everyone else&#8217;s take on Lesser Evil is. Should help right around election time. And I threw Cthulhu and Evil Lincoln in there as controls, cause everyone knows nothings really more evil than Evil Lincoln except Cthulhu. So if they end getting voted the lesser evil I know all you people are lying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008660.html">Russ says</a> is definitely true, taking a videocast and putting it up on The Big Screen in the living room is certainly much different than watching it on your desktop or on a device. I knew that though, and I&#8217;ve been a pretty big video fan for a long time. So I just want to give a hat tip to the folks who I&#8217;ve been watching who made it obvious that peer produced video content was going to make a huge difference:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.ericrice.com/">Eric Rice</a> - has been blowing this horn for as long as I&#8217;ve known him.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.dimension7.com/">Michael O&#8217;Rourke</a> - comes from a video background to begin with, and has been looking for the growth in peer produced content.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.chapmanlogic.com/blog/">Eli Chapman</a> - from <a href="http://www.unmediated.org/">Unmediated.org</a>. I ran into Eli a few times when he was out in SF, in particular at our <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/02/another-standing-room-only-momo.html">Mobile Monday on media</a> and he told me about a bunch of interesting projects going on with videocasting.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/">Amanda Congdon</a> - Rocketboom was the first recurring themed show that I heard lots of people talking about. It really caught my attention when I was at lunch with a dozen folks, and when someone brought up Rocketboom there were four other people who said &#8220;I watch that too&#8221;.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1757&amp;mo=10&amp;yr=2005">moderating a panel tomorrow on social software</a>. It looks like the impetus for the discussion might have been <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/08/issue/feature_social.asp?p=0">a recent article in the MIT Technology Review about Social Computing</a>. The panel participants and I have been emailing this week talking about what the discussion points for the panel should be. It&#8217;s pretty obvious that &#8220;Social Networking&#8221; has become a pretty corrupted term meaning just about any software that involves a community of users. I know that I&#8217;m personally jazzed about continuous/ubiquitous computing and the transformation in online services that accompanies access to information at the decision point instead of just on the desktop. I&#8217;m also pretty happy about the decomposition of the silos of information that made up the previous versions of online services into services which include APIs as major components of their offerings.</p>

<p>So along those lines what issues are currently on my hot plate in terms of influencing that environment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Merging of services. VOIP has allowed relatively easy voice communication from a computer instead of a telephone, and <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/07/01/profile-userplane/">Userplane</a> turn that into a feature within another service. When these remixes happen both sides of the equation tend to expose more developer control points. VOIP services have <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=24">turned telecom into a programmer platform</a> much richer than previous versions of voice communications.</p></li>
<li><p>Ad-hoc standardization of intersystems communication. Think <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>, but I don&#8217;t really care if it&#8217;s a microformats.org stanndard or something from somewhere else. The main point is a simple but evolving and flexible method for exchanging rich information between tools as well as people. There&#8217;s a lot of activity around events and calendaring right now, I think it&#8217;s great.</p></li>
<li><p>Location based services are the ultimate situated software. And I don&#8217;t just mean GPS systems here. Any time when your computer/mobile can figure out where you are and what you&#8217;re doing, and tailor the interface and information you receive based on that (should you choose to have it do so). This I think is one of the major answers to the small screen problem. It&#8217;s hard to drive rich user interaction from a one-hand operated mobile device, so you have to scavenge context in any way you can to make that user interface simpler.</p></li>
<li><p>Group action. <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Recommendation systems</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">group authoring and self moderation</a>, <a href="http://www.rojo.com/today/">social</a> <a href="http://www.flock.com/home/">browsing</a>, <a href="http://www.gahbunga.com/">realtime rating services</a>.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/06/2223232&amp;from=rss">This mention of lightweight cooperative multithreading and coroutines</a> caught my eye for some reason. Maybe cause it&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything in C and I got a patch this morning for one of my open source palm programs. Which of course got me thinking about programs that write programs, a concept which gets discovered and rediscovered often enough that I think I&#8217;ve seen it about a half dozen times in my relatively short career. Given <a href="http://www.ning.com">the new gig</a> I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about domain specific languages, abstraction, and metaprogramming. In particular I&#8217;ve been thinking about the tradeoffs between mature systems that exhibit good abstraction and the cut-and-paste reuse that most people instinctively sneer at. Programming in C actually tends to mix the two styles quite a bit. C code tends to be maleable because of the tools available to shape it, the (often abused) macro facility, and the ability to do just about anything you want with your types if you use pointers. Watching something like the Linux kernel evolve through sets of patches makes you realize that there is a metalanguage in the deltas. Over time interface points in the code shift and join, moving from interfaces used in change sets to interfaces instantiated in the model of the program itself.</p>

<p>So how do you encourage the same maleable programming when you have a bunch of independent programs? Can the same cut-and-paste evolution style that helped grow the web take hold in application code? The coroutines implemented in a bunch of tricky C code are relatively easily represented <a href="http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/languages/scheme/tutorial-dsitaram/t-y-scheme-Z-H-14.html">in scheme using continuation passing style</a>. When do you implement using C and when do you push the function down into the language itself? I&#8217;m just wondering in writing at this point, I don&#8217;t have any answers to this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The early conversation around the Ning launch has been great. Checking out the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/ning?setcount=100">ning tag at del.icio.us</a> (429 people bookmarked the site as of this writing) or <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/ning">Technorati search for ning</a> or <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=ning&amp;sort=date">Feedster search for ning</a> turns up a whole bunch of posts. Here are some of the ones that call out the peices that I&#8217;m really jazzed about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/04/ning_roll_your_own_f.html">BoingBoing</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/10/the_24_hour_lau.html">Jeff Clavier at Software Only</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002854.php">Richard MacManus at Read/Write Web</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/04/ning-launches/">Techcrunch</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/10/04/ning-the-real-24-hour-laundry/">Om Malik</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Being able to pick up other peoples apps to clone and customize them right on the playground really gets me excited. We&#8217;ve already seen a ton of innovative and interesting work with open source web applications, and hopefully this will take it to the next level by lowering the activation energy for a developer even further. Previously if someone saw a great bit of open source and thought &#8220;Wow, my school/club/social network/church/cult/communist cell/support group could really use one of those apps&#8221; they would have to put some effort into finding a place to host the application, bandwidth, installation and configuration, etc. What we&#8217;re trying to do is collapse all of that into a single step. So that the decision to use an application you see on Ning is immediately followed by customizing that application for your users and not doing valueless infrastructure work. It looks like a lot of the folks out there picked up on that really quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003278.html">took the wraps off our secret project this evening</a>. I didn&#8217;t want to post anything until we actually had information to make public for fear of <a href="http://www.wingedpig.com/archives/000207.html">attracting more negative attention</a>. It&#8217;s been hard to keep quiet. It&#8217;s a fantastic team and we&#8217;ve all been fired up about what we&#8217;re doing. But it&#8217;s up now! I can show people and blather on about what we&#8217;ve been doing and gather feedback.</p>

<p>So of course the place to start is &#8220;What is it?&#8221; Take a look at <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a>. Like Diego said, it&#8217;s a playground for building and using social applications on the web. There&#8217;s a bunch of info in the <a href="http://faq.ning.com/">Ning FAQ</a> that fills in the details. I&#8217;ve been thinking of it as &#8220;Rip, Mix, Burn&#8221; for web applications. We can&#8217;t open it up completely yet and let everyone clone the apps in the playground, but that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s headed. We&#8217;ve already seen some great interaction and growth within the group of developers we were working with during the quiet period. I can&#8217;t wait to see what ideas and suggestions come out of the next round! At the bottom of the sidebar attached to every page in Ning is a Ning Feedback link, please use it.</p>
