  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nothing like a <a href="http://insight.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,39020463,39235813,00.htm">handgrenade of doubt</a> to cause the venture capitalists to scuttle for cover. Is the investment in open source a bubble? Fuck no. $144 million into open source based companies is nothing at all. A drop in the bucket compared to the amount of venture money out there right now. Unfortunately something like this ends up causing doubt, and putting pressure on the open source folks to post immediate returns when their venture backers start getting nervous that they bought into open source and now others are pausing before dipping their fingers into the pot. As for any open source company requiring a community, sure it&#8217;s a good base metric. If all you&#8217;re doing is cookie cutter matching of investment profiles, sure, put that in there as a checkbox. But I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s someone else who&#8217;s going to come up and prove that wrong at some point. A company with a strong internal development team and an open source product that uses the open nature of their offering as more of a risk management lever for their customers than a development technique for including outside resources. There are other models out there I&#8217;m sure. I thought venture was supposed to help find those other models, not just pile on the one that&#8217;s already there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Defcon I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=539">mentioned the big blowup with Cisco</a>. Just to follow up on that thread, they&#8217;ve now <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/03/1613226&amp;from=rss">announced a patch</a> for the vulnerability. Pretty much blowing away the theory that some folks had that this was an attack that didn&#8217;t really work in the wild. Three month response time for a major security issue. Wow that sucks. It&#8217;s a good thing they have all that money to use to supress the information so that they can take their sweet time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to <a href="http://www.tagcamp.org/">Tagcamp</a> this past weekend, fantastic event. I met a ton of new people, which is always fun. A lot of great information and new projects. Although I missed her presentation, I found out about Rashmi&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rashmisinha.com/archives/05_09/tagging-cognitive.html">cognitive analysis of tagging</a> while I was there. I think the two images there explain why tagging is different than categorization better than anything else I&#8217;ve seen before. The session that <a href="http://marshallk.com/">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> was very lively. The conversation focused on making tagging more accessible to users. If tagging really is a different model for organizing information how can we provide that in a way that doesn&#8217;t include a large cliff to adoption? Some of the folks proposed getting together sets of user stories as a start to finding the common bits and root drivers for successful adoption. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t find where anyone has written down that tag, the notes from the session seem to have gotten rightly fucked. Anyone have another copy of the notes floating around on a hard drive?</p>

<p>Mike Prince from <a href="http://www.mobido.com">Mobido</a> spoke some about the tag system they have for creating group conversations, and at the end of his conversation we branched out some and spoke in general about tagging systems and mobility. I&#8217;m always interested in what I call &#8220;closing the feedback loop&#8221;. Systems and techniques that make it possible to both publish and consume from a mobile device. Tagging systems, and the associated models that go along with them, seem like they would be well suited to supporting a fully mobile system. The demo from <a href="http://www.photo-router.com/">PhotoRouter</a> later on in the day provided an example of one form that could take. Users sending photos can tag those images with whatever they want, no setting of categories in advance necessary. Receivers can opt into receiving photos with a given tag when they receive something they like. Now if they start sending photos to the group with a tag influenced by what they&#8217;ve gotten recently that&#8217;s the kind of direct in-the-field interaction I think we&#8217;re going to keep seeing more and more of.  There&#8217;s a swarming kind of behavior that takes place with tagging, and being able to see other peoples tags as you tag yourself is a big part of that. I think it&#8217;s the reason that tag/heat maps get so much attention, cause they provide the information about hotspots at a glance and help drive the convergence that turns tagging from noise into collaborative filtering.</p>

<p>There was a bunch of interest in making tagging more generic. Tagging tends to be something that you do with the major content of a system. <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> lets you add tags to bookmarks, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> allows tags for photos. But should you be able to tag users? Tag collections? Tag any object? Tag other tags? General consensus seemed to be yes, you should be able to. <a href="http://toetag.sourceforge.net/">Toetag</a> is a project setup to attempt to create a generic system for providing such a system as a standard component. There were some others working on somewhat similar systems, but I only caught the Toetag presentation unfortunately. We&#8217;ve had that conversation at Ning a few times, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons that tags are a fundamental function of the system. I was happy to hear that we weren&#8217;t off in the weeds conceptually, and that if anything we should be making that functionality more generic.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone involved in getting Tagcamp together! It was a great event, and I think most people got a lot of great information out of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been wandering around a bit lately, so fixing the DHCP problem I had with the ipw2200 drivers under Linux on the Thinkpad was finally a priority. I was about to apply a patch I had a pointer to, when I saw that there are new versions out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ieee80211.sourceforge.net/">ieee80211</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">ipw2200</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php">new firmware too</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Nice, now DHCP works with WPA. Lets see now if the driver as a whole is more reliable. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things I hear pretty often is &#8220;sometimes you just have to go with the lesser evil&#8221;. Now, granted, I probably tend to get myself into situations that would spark that remark more often than is normal. But I&#8217;m sure most of you have heard it somewhere along the line. It&#8217;s not like that really solves anything though. Evil is supposed to be all trixie and insidious. Make you think you&#8217;re doing good when you&#8217;re really doing evil. The ol&#8217; bait and switch. If I knew which was the lesser evil I wouldn&#8217;t be pondering in the first place. So instead of pondering I just built an app to help: <a href="http://lesserevil.ning.com">Lesser Evil</a>. So that I can find out what everyone else&#8217;s take on Lesser Evil is. Should help right around election time. And I threw Cthulhu and Evil Lincoln in there as controls, cause everyone knows nothings really more evil than Evil Lincoln except Cthulhu. So if they end getting voted the lesser evil I know all you people are lying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008660.html">Russ says</a> is definitely true, taking a videocast and putting it up on The Big Screen in the living room is certainly much different than watching it on your desktop or on a device. I knew that though, and I&#8217;ve been a pretty big video fan for a long time. So I just want to give a hat tip to the folks who I&#8217;ve been watching who made it obvious that peer produced video content was going to make a huge difference:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.ericrice.com/">Eric Rice</a> - has been blowing this horn for as long as I&#8217;ve known him.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.dimension7.com/">Michael O&#8217;Rourke</a> - comes from a video background to begin with, and has been looking for the growth in peer produced content.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.chapmanlogic.com/blog/">Eli Chapman</a> - from <a href="http://www.unmediated.org/">Unmediated.org</a>. I ran into Eli a few times when he was out in SF, in particular at our <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/02/another-standing-room-only-momo.html">Mobile Monday on media</a> and he told me about a bunch of interesting projects going on with videocasting.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/">Amanda Congdon</a> - Rocketboom was the first recurring themed show that I heard lots of people talking about. It really caught my attention when I was at lunch with a dozen folks, and when someone brought up Rocketboom there were four other people who said &#8220;I watch that too&#8221;.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1757&amp;mo=10&amp;yr=2005">moderating a panel tomorrow on social software</a>. It looks like the impetus for the discussion might have been <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/08/issue/feature_social.asp?p=0">a recent article in the MIT Technology Review about Social Computing</a>. The panel participants and I have been emailing this week talking about what the discussion points for the panel should be. It&#8217;s pretty obvious that &#8220;Social Networking&#8221; has become a pretty corrupted term meaning just about any software that involves a community of users. I know that I&#8217;m personally jazzed about continuous/ubiquitous computing and the transformation in online services that accompanies access to information at the decision point instead of just on the desktop. I&#8217;m also pretty happy about the decomposition of the silos of information that made up the previous versions of online services into services which include APIs as major components of their offerings.</p>

<p>So along those lines what issues are currently on my hot plate in terms of influencing that environment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Merging of services. VOIP has allowed relatively easy voice communication from a computer instead of a telephone, and <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/07/01/profile-userplane/">Userplane</a> turn that into a feature within another service. When these remixes happen both sides of the equation tend to expose more developer control points. VOIP services have <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=24">turned telecom into a programmer platform</a> much richer than previous versions of voice communications.</p></li>
<li><p>Ad-hoc standardization of intersystems communication. Think <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>, but I don&#8217;t really care if it&#8217;s a microformats.org stanndard or something from somewhere else. The main point is a simple but evolving and flexible method for exchanging rich information between tools as well as people. There&#8217;s a lot of activity around events and calendaring right now, I think it&#8217;s great.</p></li>
<li><p>Location based services are the ultimate situated software. And I don&#8217;t just mean GPS systems here. Any time when your computer/mobile can figure out where you are and what you&#8217;re doing, and tailor the interface and information you receive based on that (should you choose to have it do so). This I think is one of the major answers to the small screen problem. It&#8217;s hard to drive rich user interaction from a one-hand operated mobile device, so you have to scavenge context in any way you can to make that user interface simpler.</p></li>
<li><p>Group action. <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Recommendation systems</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">group authoring and self moderation</a>, <a href="http://www.rojo.com/today/">social</a> <a href="http://www.flock.com/home/">browsing</a>, <a href="http://www.gahbunga.com/">realtime rating services</a>.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/06/2223232&amp;from=rss">This mention of lightweight cooperative multithreading and coroutines</a> caught my eye for some reason. Maybe cause it&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything in C and I got a patch this morning for one of my open source palm programs. Which of course got me thinking about programs that write programs, a concept which gets discovered and rediscovered often enough that I think I&#8217;ve seen it about a half dozen times in my relatively short career. Given <a href="http://www.ning.com">the new gig</a> I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about domain specific languages, abstraction, and metaprogramming. In particular I&#8217;ve been thinking about the tradeoffs between mature systems that exhibit good abstraction and the cut-and-paste reuse that most people instinctively sneer at. Programming in C actually tends to mix the two styles quite a bit. C code tends to be maleable because of the tools available to shape it, the (often abused) macro facility, and the ability to do just about anything you want with your types if you use pointers. Watching something like the Linux kernel evolve through sets of patches makes you realize that there is a metalanguage in the deltas. Over time interface points in the code shift and join, moving from interfaces used in change sets to interfaces instantiated in the model of the program itself.</p>

<p>So how do you encourage the same maleable programming when you have a bunch of independent programs? Can the same cut-and-paste evolution style that helped grow the web take hold in application code? The coroutines implemented in a bunch of tricky C code are relatively easily represented <a href="http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/languages/scheme/tutorial-dsitaram/t-y-scheme-Z-H-14.html">in scheme using continuation passing style</a>. When do you implement using C and when do you push the function down into the language itself? I&#8217;m just wondering in writing at this point, I don&#8217;t have any answers to this one.</p>
