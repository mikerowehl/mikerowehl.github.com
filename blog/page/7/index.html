  <div class="entry-content"><p>Getting <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=596">audio on to the iPod using Linux was a snap</a>. Getting videos on took a bit more doing, but also worked out quite well. I&#8217;m listing the info here cause it took a little searching around to find it. This is the stuff you&#8217;ll need you probably don&#8217;t have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gtkpod.org/downloads.html">gtkpod and libgpod</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/downloads/index.php">mp4v2 from the mpeg4ip project</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>You also might need libid3tag, libtool, flex, and the development headers for glib and gtk.  I&#8217;m using Ubuntu 5.04 and was able to apt-get everything I was missing from the default install except for the stuff above. At the time of this writing the libgpod lib was at version 0.3.0, gtkpod was at 0.99.2, and mpeg4ip was at 1.4.1. I downloaded official versions of all, not a checkout from CVS or a development snapshot.</p>

<p>I had tried to download a video (my test video was the iPod version of <a href="http://clerks2.com/?p=48">The Good, The Bad, and The Man</a>, how do you like that for a test biznatch?) to the iPod, but it failed silently. Then I took a look at the changelog for gtkpod and saw that video support was added after the version I had. So I downloaded the newer drops and compiled, but didn&#8217;t have mp4v2 at that point. This time I got an error that the lib was required in order to download files of .m4v type. After I compiled the lib, reconfigured and built gtkpod, everything was smooth after that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was gifted a video <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, my first real iPod device (I have a shuffle that I used for podcasts and occasionally a mix for running). I&#8217;m a Linux only user, and I&#8217;m accustomed to paying for the convenience in most areas with some pain when trying out new devices. Much to my surprize however, this one was a cinch. I Googled for Linux support for the video iPod (search results much polluted with info about Linux FOR the iPod), and found that gtkpod claimed support for video ipods. apt-cache search gtkpod under <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>. apt-get install, cable, gtkpod, clicky clicky, and there are songs on my iPod. No pain. I wonder how long I&#8217;ll keep flinching for. Great job from the Linux/Open Source community, this was really a very much painless experience! Even more pleasant than the last Windows based install of iTunes I performed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/">Jon Aquino</a> and Matt Webb have been working on some interesting stuff on Ning.  They put together a relatively simple component system that generates dynamic images representing the state of <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a> apps.  Jon put it together for some of his apps, like <a href="http://restaurantreviewswithmaps.ning.com">Restaurant Reviews with Maps</a>. I stole the stuff and added it to an app I&#8217;ve been working on called <a href="http://paloaltopsp.ning.com">Palo Alto PSP Games</a>. The result: if you setup a profile on PAPSP and add games, you&#8217;ll find a link on your profile page that takes you to cut and paste code you can drop into your blog template.  And it&#8217;ll output an image like this linking to your profile and giving the number of games you have in the system:</p>

<p><a href="http://paloaltopsp.ning.com/profile.php?user=miker"><img src="http://paloaltopsp.ning.com/badge.php?action=image&amp;application=paloaltopsp&amp;user=miker&amp;tag=&amp;contentType=Game&amp;singular=game&amp;plural=games&amp;png=http%3A%2F%2Fpaloaltopsp.ning.com%2Fimages%2Fpspbadge.png&amp;r=255&amp;g=255&amp;b=255&amp;font=FreeSansBold.ttf&amp;fontHeight=12&amp;x=30&amp;y=26&amp;alignment=left&amp;text2=Palo%20Alto%20PSP%20Games&amp;r2=255&amp;g2=255&amp;b2=255&amp;font2=FreeSans.ttf&amp;fontHeight2=6&amp;x2=30&amp;y2=10&amp;alignment2=left" alt="" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nothing like a <a href="http://insight.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,39020463,39235813,00.htm">handgrenade of doubt</a> to cause the venture capitalists to scuttle for cover. Is the investment in open source a bubble? Fuck no. $144 million into open source based companies is nothing at all. A drop in the bucket compared to the amount of venture money out there right now. Unfortunately something like this ends up causing doubt, and putting pressure on the open source folks to post immediate returns when their venture backers start getting nervous that they bought into open source and now others are pausing before dipping their fingers into the pot. As for any open source company requiring a community, sure it&#8217;s a good base metric. If all you&#8217;re doing is cookie cutter matching of investment profiles, sure, put that in there as a checkbox. But I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s someone else who&#8217;s going to come up and prove that wrong at some point. A company with a strong internal development team and an open source product that uses the open nature of their offering as more of a risk management lever for their customers than a development technique for including outside resources. There are other models out there I&#8217;m sure. I thought venture was supposed to help find those other models, not just pile on the one that&#8217;s already there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Defcon I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=539">mentioned the big blowup with Cisco</a>. Just to follow up on that thread, they&#8217;ve now <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/03/1613226&amp;from=rss">announced a patch</a> for the vulnerability. Pretty much blowing away the theory that some folks had that this was an attack that didn&#8217;t really work in the wild. Three month response time for a major security issue. Wow that sucks. It&#8217;s a good thing they have all that money to use to supress the information so that they can take their sweet time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to <a href="http://www.tagcamp.org/">Tagcamp</a> this past weekend, fantastic event. I met a ton of new people, which is always fun. A lot of great information and new projects. Although I missed her presentation, I found out about Rashmi&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rashmisinha.com/archives/05_09/tagging-cognitive.html">cognitive analysis of tagging</a> while I was there. I think the two images there explain why tagging is different than categorization better than anything else I&#8217;ve seen before. The session that <a href="http://marshallk.com/">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> was very lively. The conversation focused on making tagging more accessible to users. If tagging really is a different model for organizing information how can we provide that in a way that doesn&#8217;t include a large cliff to adoption? Some of the folks proposed getting together sets of user stories as a start to finding the common bits and root drivers for successful adoption. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t find where anyone has written down that tag, the notes from the session seem to have gotten rightly fucked. Anyone have another copy of the notes floating around on a hard drive?</p>

<p>Mike Prince from <a href="http://www.mobido.com">Mobido</a> spoke some about the tag system they have for creating group conversations, and at the end of his conversation we branched out some and spoke in general about tagging systems and mobility. I&#8217;m always interested in what I call &#8220;closing the feedback loop&#8221;. Systems and techniques that make it possible to both publish and consume from a mobile device. Tagging systems, and the associated models that go along with them, seem like they would be well suited to supporting a fully mobile system. The demo from <a href="http://www.photo-router.com/">PhotoRouter</a> later on in the day provided an example of one form that could take. Users sending photos can tag those images with whatever they want, no setting of categories in advance necessary. Receivers can opt into receiving photos with a given tag when they receive something they like. Now if they start sending photos to the group with a tag influenced by what they&#8217;ve gotten recently that&#8217;s the kind of direct in-the-field interaction I think we&#8217;re going to keep seeing more and more of.  There&#8217;s a swarming kind of behavior that takes place with tagging, and being able to see other peoples tags as you tag yourself is a big part of that. I think it&#8217;s the reason that tag/heat maps get so much attention, cause they provide the information about hotspots at a glance and help drive the convergence that turns tagging from noise into collaborative filtering.</p>

<p>There was a bunch of interest in making tagging more generic. Tagging tends to be something that you do with the major content of a system. <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> lets you add tags to bookmarks, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> allows tags for photos. But should you be able to tag users? Tag collections? Tag any object? Tag other tags? General consensus seemed to be yes, you should be able to. <a href="http://toetag.sourceforge.net/">Toetag</a> is a project setup to attempt to create a generic system for providing such a system as a standard component. There were some others working on somewhat similar systems, but I only caught the Toetag presentation unfortunately. We&#8217;ve had that conversation at Ning a few times, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons that tags are a fundamental function of the system. I was happy to hear that we weren&#8217;t off in the weeds conceptually, and that if anything we should be making that functionality more generic.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone involved in getting Tagcamp together! It was a great event, and I think most people got a lot of great information out of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been wandering around a bit lately, so fixing the DHCP problem I had with the ipw2200 drivers under Linux on the Thinkpad was finally a priority. I was about to apply a patch I had a pointer to, when I saw that there are new versions out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ieee80211.sourceforge.net/">ieee80211</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">ipw2200</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php">new firmware too</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Nice, now DHCP works with WPA. Lets see now if the driver as a whole is more reliable. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things I hear pretty often is &#8220;sometimes you just have to go with the lesser evil&#8221;. Now, granted, I probably tend to get myself into situations that would spark that remark more often than is normal. But I&#8217;m sure most of you have heard it somewhere along the line. It&#8217;s not like that really solves anything though. Evil is supposed to be all trixie and insidious. Make you think you&#8217;re doing good when you&#8217;re really doing evil. The ol&#8217; bait and switch. If I knew which was the lesser evil I wouldn&#8217;t be pondering in the first place. So instead of pondering I just built an app to help: <a href="http://lesserevil.ning.com">Lesser Evil</a>. So that I can find out what everyone else&#8217;s take on Lesser Evil is. Should help right around election time. And I threw Cthulhu and Evil Lincoln in there as controls, cause everyone knows nothings really more evil than Evil Lincoln except Cthulhu. So if they end getting voted the lesser evil I know all you people are lying.</p>
