  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently went to listen to <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1206&amp;mo=11&amp;yr=2003">the VP of Product Marketing from PalmSource, Charlie Tritschler, speak at a SDForum Web Services Special Interest Group</a>. The presentation itself was very informative. It sounded like Palm was really taking a great approach to Web Services. Charlie spoke about how PalmSource had a package available for writing SOAP clients for the Palm, and how they were planning to push support for web services down into the operating system in future versions. I think this stuff is a great idea, and have had <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/openSource/palmos.html">some thoughts about making the palm more network-centric</a> online for a while myself. So I have no problem at all marching to the beat of that drum, it matches up perfect with the pace I was keeping anyway. So I went to download the toolkit from Palm, and had to eat my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The first cause for concern was that I had to go to this section called the &#8220;Developer Seeding Area&#8221; at <a href="http://www.palmsource.com">PalmSource</a> to find info about the package. I won&#8217;t bother providing a link to the area, cause you can&#8217;t get access unless you&#8217;re registered as a Palm developer. That&#8217;s the first bad sign, that Palm has lumped this wonderful enabling technology in with their older information controlled releases. Why do they restrict these public releases? I&#8217;m sure they say so that they can get to know their development community better. But I&#8217;m definite all they do is alienate the open source developers. Bad move. And then once I did find a link to the toolkit, it took me to another area, at <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/">IBM alphaWorks</a>, this time with another license agreement. And then, when I did download it, I found out that the release was for Windows only. Ouch.</p>

<p>So, props to PalmSource for the effort. But they seem to be missing the boat on this one. Web Services are a great idea, but not just because they&#8217;re a simple format for performing RPC. The reason they&#8217;ve gone so far so fast is that they represent the open source culture at work. RPC is not a new idea. Open formats and tools, encouraging further open formats and more free tools, that&#8217;s what made the concept so powerful. That&#8217;s why this idea has become the universal connector, and why it makes business sense to &#8220;Web Service&#8221;-ify all types of applications. Allowing the Palm platform to tap into that interface is a great idea. But providing a very Old World set of tools to do so is half-assed. To get the full advantage of Web Services we need to embrace the culture of the Web Services crowd. I think this represents an oportunity to inflame the imagination of some otherwise lost developers. The path that they&#8217;ve taken is little more than marginal pandering, and Web Services could really fling open the doors standing at the network interface of the Palm platform and allow some great innovation.</p>

<p>Put my code where my mouth is? Sure, you bet I will. It starts like this. Add a dash of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/PalmHTTP/">HTTP support</a> to a cup full of <a href="http://cytheric.net/palm-xml/doc/index.html">XML support</a> and blend vigorously till you can see foam starting to form. What I have to do is add an XMLRPC-EPI type interface to parse along the lines of allowed and expected rpc elements, and create some XML generation procedures, and we should have an open source platform for web services. Expect an entry in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/splitbits.html">Split Bits Area</a> once I have something working.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gadgetopia has an <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2003/11/29/LinuxBlowsUpIn2004.html">entry</a> linking to <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1398069,00.asp">an article at eweek</a> about what the year 2004 will bring for Linux. The article is very positive, which of course makes me happy. Every year since 2000 I&#8217;ve heard from one sector or another that Linux is going to just &#8220;blow up&#8221; during the upcoming year. While it has gained market acceptance over time, it&#8217;s gone through the more gradual adoption process that most technologies do.  Many technological advances do take a number of years to really succeed, cell phones being the example that I&#8217;ve heard referenced most recently. Linux has put in its time as a technological advance. I&#8217;ve been using it for over 10 years, and I wasn&#8217;t even the first in my college dorm to pick up the project.</p>

<p>But to look at Linux as just a technological advance misses many of the deeper changes which it represents. In my opinion Linux does provide a great operating system. In a very short time it has grown from a small personal project into a robust system capable of running an excellent selection of desktop and server software. I haven&#8217;t even owned a Windows system for the last 4 years, I&#8217;m 100% Linux. So I do rate myself a pretty big fan. I&#8217;ve been agitating for more Linux use since my first &#8220;real job&#8221;, and the reactions frequently have very little to do with the technology, or even the price. The issues that frequently come back from business people have to do with the logistics of running Linux systems. Support contracts, accountability, the available tallent pool, certifications, and stuff like that. Linux doesn&#8217;t represent just a new technology, like say switching from one ERP system to another. It represents a whole new form of carrying out IT capability.  Trying to deploy Linux without understanding the way that the system as a whole works will lead to a failed implementation. Just like trying to automate an inefficient assembly line process by just throwing technology at what&#8217;s already being done is just going to lead you to automated inefficiency. Thowing Linux at a floundering IT department will just lead to an IT department flailing with open souce tools. Linux is poised to make that IT explosion.  But in my opinion open source developers at times don&#8217;t really understand open source. If I had a dollar for every developer who released code for free and then whined when some big corporation picked it up cause they think they should &#8220;get compensated for their work&#8221; I would probably be able to take a year vacation.</p>

<p>The people who have been &#8220;doing open source&#8221; frequently don&#8217;t have the business background to make the strong case to a CEO or CIO. It has taken time for the knowledge about why this system works to make it to the people who can then carry it up the chain of command (this indicates a serious problem with corporations in general by the way, but we&#8217;ll leave that issue alone for now). I think even the business people have known for a long time that Linux is a better operating system than Windows, and that the new tallent available overseas and coming out of colleges has more hands on experience with open source than they do with Microsoft. The issue has been being able to qualify and quantify risks and insure smooth operations. Maybe the cold hard facts of how well Linux has worked will finally overcome the inflated numbers that Microsoft pays leagues of salesmen to flood every potential customer with. But I&#8217;m not going to hold my breath on that one.</p>

<p>Linux companies seem to be taking the correct paths. Redhat moving to concentrate it&#8217;s resources on corporate customers is a move I actually applaud. I&#8217;ll miss the Redhat Network updates for my desktop (yes, I was a paying customer, with more than one system subscribed). But trimming their operations down so that they can provide the full range of bundled services which the corporate customer needs makes far more sense than just running a software update service which reaches more people. IBM has done a lot to help as well. Maybe the horrible performance of Microsoft in dealing with security issues will be enough to finally chip away the facade of &#8220;accountability&#8221; which people seem to also site when they give reasons for using Microsoft. All these issues did exist in the past however, and still Linux has been growing slowly. I do hope that it takes off during 2004, and I&#8217;ll be doing my best to help ensure that it does.</p>

<p>Linux SHOULD explode in 2004.  But Linux also should have exploded in 2000, 2001, 2002, and this year. The limiting factor is businesses who can&#8217;t take advantage because they can&#8217;t fit Linux within the framework of what they know how to quantify and talk about. Linux is a disruptive technology, one that&#8217;s so disruptive that even the people who work with and on it frequently don&#8217;t fully understand why the things that they&#8217;re doing have worked out. But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that open source provides the best software, and makes the most sense long term. If the explosion does happen during this upcoming year I don&#8217;t think anyone can predict how it will turn out. When it does happen I expect the impact will be so drastic and far reaching that the information technology industry will no longer be recognizable when compared to what it looks like today. I can hardly wait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The trend all over seems to be decentralization of the corporation.  This is certainly true of software development here in the US, where more and more of the work is farmed out to lower cost workers in India, China, Russia, or just about anywhere else.  But offshoring is just one particular aspect of a general decentralization. Institutions are attempting to become leaner, faster, more responsive. They use technology to farm traditionally internal functions out to external consultants, and they use technology to dissolve the internal hierarchy. The elimination of middle management and bureaucracy in general has called for new tools to support the organization. Traditional ERP and CRM systems fall flat here. Those tools were mostly made to support the old processes, they never enabled the major changes that technology reallyrepresents.</p>

<p>A new set of tools is needed. One that allows for fluid communication between any members of the organization, not only communications along the lines of traditional power hierarchy. The tools have to be able to cross organization boundaries and extend to outside consultants, customers, service providers, partners, and sometimes even competitors. The corporate world has a great model to look at in determining the possible avenues of progress here. The open source community has organized huge groups of people to collaborate on projects, frequently with what seems like no organizational overseeing at all. This community hasproduced, among other things, the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">most popular web server in use on the Internet today</a>. It&#8217;s a process which definitely works, and I think a deeper understanding of why it works would benefit current executives immensely. Many business people look at open source as an anomaly. They see a group of radicals who don&#8217;t really hold any relation to &#8220;the real world&#8221;.  But an understanding of the open source motivation actually leads to a further argument in favor of decentralization.</p>

<p>There is a misconception held by those outside the open source community that the major motivations of programmers working on these projects are pride, humanitarian interests, social interaction, or a number of other marginal feelings. Throw out that misconception. The major motivation is the direct need of the programmer for quality software. There might be professional need for a good embedded system on which to build, need for a good image manipulation program, need for a desktop which can present text in Arabic, or any other of a number of requirements. But the major motivation for the group taken as a whole is the production of software that they can use. It&#8217;s the free market effect at work, something that every business person should be able to realize once they see it. It doesn&#8217;t matter that traditional learning says that corporations should be able to build better software, cause that&#8217;s not the way that it has been working. That traditional learning needs to be thrown out, cause there&#8217;s an error in there.</p>

<p>If this could be done for the software production business, I think it&#8217;s possible for other industries as well. Maybe even inevitable. I think we&#8217;ll eventually find that a dispersed group of highly involved and highly motivated people, loosely connected, can be applied to any number of problems which traditional thinking says are best served by a highly structured organization. As this realization starts to work it&#8217;s way into other industries, I think the tools currently supporting open source programmers will migrate out with it. Corporate intranets will start to look more like community special interest sites like <a href="http://www.rootprompt.org">rootprompt.org</a>, <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/">mozillazine.org</a>, <a href="http://www.kernelnotes.org">kernelnotes.org</a>, or <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/">handhelds.org</a>. Personal status updates will look more like blogs. There&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/drupal/node/view/1312">information about one possible configuration</a> of Internet collaboration technology used in helping to realize the corporate goal of decentralization. I&#8217;ve been looking very hard at applying blogs and similar technology to the issues also. I expect there will probably be a number of updates here revolving around that issue. If you have an idea you&#8217;re thinking about applying within your organization, and you&#8217;re looking for help getting it running, <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">contact us</a>. We&#8217;re always on the lookout for groundbreaking solutions to participate in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OSNews has a <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5243">review of the book &#8220;Code Reading: An Open Source Perspective&#8221;</a>. It looks like it could be pretty interesting. There&#8217;s a lot of great code out there now, produced by thousands and thousands of open source projects. I don&#8217;t think it can be stressed enough that the benefit of open source lies not only in the working projects that they produce, but in the millions of lines of working examples that programmers can pull from. This really lies at the heart of the explosive growth of open source, and is one of the major underpinnings of the GPL mindset. Open code begets open code because every project provides a base for new efforts to build on top of.</p>

<p>Traditional computer science and software engineering would have one believe that reuse is supposed to happen at the module, library, and object levels for maximum efficiency. But forcing reuse to happen at that level and only at that level is unnecessarily restrictive. The ability to peek under the covers and see how something should be done, and occasionally exercising the ability to just rip the whole thing to shreds and start over, has allowed the open source community to evolve much faster than the proprietary product market was ever able to. I think that it has and will continue to contribute to the education of new programmers. Students are no longer forced to accept what they&#8217;re being told. They can go out and look at successful implementations and find out what really works in practice. Institutions attempting to teach computer science and software engineering would do best to accept this and work with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100213">great article at The Feature</a> that lays out why converged devices are winning in the market, and why this might point to a need for cellular providers to give up trying to pull value from the wrong areas of their network. I&#8217;ve agree very strongly with this opinion:</p>

<blockquote><p>The first wireless operator to execute the Dell/Wal-Mart model &#8211; being the efficient commodity provider, with a great brand &#8211; will make a killing. (Partly because they will kill their competitors.) Not that this is an easy task. Legacy billing systems and legacy culture are huge hurdles to overcome, and the ideas of &#8220;owning the customer&#8221; and &#8220;delivering value-added services&#8221; are deeply embedded in operator DNA.</p></blockquote>

<p>I normally don&#8217;t read the articles over at The Feature, but this one really jives with my own assessment. They&#8217;ve been added to my newsfeed aggregator. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s been their goal all along ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s official now, I&#8217;ve tested out the 1.4 release of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> to post to a <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blog and it works perfect. Even the title and category work (although the category must be specified numerically). I&#8217;m considering adding in support for the b2 version of getCategories before I make it through the 2.0 release. WordPress is a great tool, and now that I&#8217;m using it for my own blog I&#8217;m very strongly motivated to tweek for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/002411.htm">entry over at picturephoning.com</a> about <a href="http://www.sentonline.com/">SENT</a>, billed as &#8220;americas first phonecam art show&#8221;. It certainly seems like it could be an interesting project. The site for the project says that all of the images used  in the exhibit will be available online, very cool. Phonecams have really worked their way out into society as a whole very quickly. Material such as that (anything that&#8217;s worked it&#8217;s way into the communal unconscious, but especially something that&#8217;s done it quickly) can provide some really fertile ground for works. The picture phone commercials run by the big cellular providers here in the US do a horrible job of showcasing the potential of these devices. Maybe once the show site opens up we&#8217;ll have something to point at as an example of a novel application.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to host my blog myself.  I&#8217;m still going to test out Vagablog with services like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> and <a href="http://www.journalspace.com">Journalspace</a>, but there&#8217;s too much that I want to explore that isn&#8217;t a part of those services yet. For instance I can actually use <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">Trackback URLs</a> now. They&#8217;re something I&#8217;ve wanted to experiment with for a long time now. Trackbacks are a technique for notifying another blogger that you&#8217;ve posted an entry which references one of their posts. It&#8217;s one method that&#8217;s available for linking together blog postings into something like threads of conversation. It&#8217;s something like posting a comment on your own blog instead of posting a comment through some feedback system on the blog you&#8217;re reading. I also wanted to be able to make an RSS feed available, that&#8217;s what the little XML link down in the Other Stuff area is for.  I chose <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> instead of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">MovableType</a> because WordPress is open source. If I manage to do what I want, you&#8217;ll be seeing some templates and patches over in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/splitbits.html">Split Bits</a> area of the Bitsplitter site.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve moved over the format that I was using over at journalspace for my <a href="http://reverend.journalspace.com">personal blog</a>.   There might be some refining to do still, but I probably won&#8217;t tweek it too much. I try to stick with a simple layout so that people can read from a handheld device if they would like.  The default layouts that come with most blogging tools are just horrid when accessed from a small device like a Palm handheld. Now I have to go fool around with getting <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> posting to this.</p>
