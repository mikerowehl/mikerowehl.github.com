  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.osviews.com/print.php?sid=684">an article at osViews</a> about trying to get together a project to develop a full fledged user desktop package. By this they mean everything that a local computer retailer would need in order to sell full fledged Linux based systems, including artwork and sales and marketing materials. I think this is a great idea. Both in terms of getting together a standard system for use by mere mortals wanting to use Linux, and in pooling together resources by many individual retailers in order to get the project completed.</p>

<p>What concerns me however, is the structure of the proposed project. They&#8217;re talking about running this like a contest. The potential sellers of Linux based desktops would provide cash and other resources to be used as prizes for those wishing to submit entries into three different areas. I actually don&#8217;t think this is a good idea. The model that I personally think would be more likely to work is to have those interested in seeing a project like this done to directly create work to be distributed under something like <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">a Creative Commons deed</a>.</p>

<p>My reasoning for running this way is because it seems like the closer the contribution is to the user of the system, the more likely the open source model will work. Put another way, the more abstraction there is between user and producer, the worse off the project is. Therefor, have the users of the work directly contribute content they would like to see made part of the project. This doesn&#8217;t mean that they have to create the work directly themselves, they can always contract a designer to do the work, pay for it directly, and then put it under Creative Commons and publicly release it. It also ensures that those producing the work without being guaranteed return (the graphic designers, video editors, actors, and whoever else would have to be included) don&#8217;t end up wasting their time. If run like a contest, if a graphic designer makes an entry that doesn&#8217;t place at all, they end up getting no reward. Whereas a producer of a Linux Desktop does get a reward, the project produces a desktop system either way. Since the vendor gets benefit no matter what the outcome, it makes the most sense that they should directly bear the cost for the time contributed.</p>

<p>The other reason for making all the work available under license and then choosing from it is so that collaboration can happen. If run like a contest, the entrants will most likely want to keep their entries secret until the final judging. If they have a great idea, and their compensation depends on the impact of that great idea, they don&#8217;t want to give it away. If the work is made public by the vendor after the producer is already paid, they will want to make it available so that others can pick up and polish the idea. Take an example where one vendor has a great idea for a commercial, but doesn&#8217;t have the means to produce the video. They can either write the script themselves, pay a writer, or find a friend to do the script for them. If they license it under CC then someone who does have the means to produce the video, find sets, and locate actors can provide the second part of realizing that vision. Taking the contest out of the picture opens up the possible avenue of collaboration between vendors and volunteers. I think that would be absolutely essential, as it is for any other open source project. I ran this by <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/index.php">my girlfriend Eleanor</a>, who does business strategy consulting, and she said a project like this would almost definitely be able to get pro bono work from some established firms just so that they could say they were involved with the project.</p>

<p>Overall, I think it&#8217;s a GREAT idea. Kudos to whoever pinned this as a necessary step for the Linux movement. I think the time is finally ripe to start looking at options like this. But it&#8217;s one of those areas where the devil is really in the details. One small mistake in the execution of the project at the early stages could really derail the whole thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/news/wireless/article/3226">An entry over at Techdirt</a> makes an interesting point about PDAs and SmartPhones:</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, as we&#8217;ve said before, we&#8217;re still not quite sure why PDAs are considered a separate market category from smart phones - as a smart phone is really just a connected PDA. Just like a computer without a modem is still a computer, no one called computers &#8220;Smart Computers&#8221; when people finally started adding modems or NIC cards to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve had some trouble with people making the PDA/SmartPhone distinction, it irked me but I was never quite sure why. That&#8217;s an excellent summary of the issue. Why does adding a cellular interface to a PDA turn it into another class of device? The commentary from Jupiter is interesting as well. I think their asessment is valid&#8230; IF network applications for mobile devices continue to disappoint. But I think the correct mix of services would quickly drive uptake of connected mobile devices. And unlike the mismanaged rollout of Bluetooth, I don&#8217;t think that handset makers are going to subsidize putting PDA functions into handsets in the hopes that they will be useful at some unspecified point in the future. Once a PDA is a useful and fully contained personal information device, I think those numbers will change. As long as the PDA is mostly a desktop peripheral with small classes of underdeveloped standalone applications, those numbers will remain low.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/7659999.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp">an article at Mercury News</a> about Motorola licensing the tracking technology that Wheels of Zeus has been working on. I wrote about WoZ in <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=79">a recent entry here</a>. What I found interesting about the article in Mercury News was that Wozniak would like to see this deployed more as a standalone system rather than getting it hooked into other information networks. I think I could see why he&#8217;s positioned that way, given what I&#8217;ve heard about wOzNET being focused on preventing issues with missing children. But it also could remove it from the playing field of location based services in general, and could leave some significant value on the table for others to snap up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a service called <a href="http://www.tagandscan.com/">TagAndScan</a> available now in the UK. It allows users to leave entries tied to a location, which other users of the service can then come back and view later on. I think of it like a blog with geolocation information, which is something that a number of people have been working on. Of course I would like to see something setup where people can use this information without being tied to a particular service provider (and having to pay to add entries). I won&#8217;t go into the details about why, I think I&#8217;ve already spouted off a bit too much recently regarding my views on companies and their ability to drive the front edge of innovation. But I would point out that while TagAndScan sounds like a really cool service (and kudos to them for deploying a service like this that users seem to be able to access easily), I would point other developers to projects like <a href="http://geourl.org/">GeoURL</a>, which attempt to get users to add geolocation info to their pages, and then provide a way to lookup local info. I would like to work on a palm app that can lookup your location based on address, then use geourl to find places near you and provide hookins to the browsers to allow viewing those locations. Should be pretty simple given what I&#8217;ve seen, but I&#8217;m still a bit of a geolocation newbie. Others who are interested, please <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">contact me</a> or leave a comment here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been kicking around the idea for the <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">Open Palm Environment</a> project for a while now.  I registered the project on Sourceforge in September of last year, so it&#8217;s been at least three months that I&#8217;ve really been actively mulling over the different aspects of the project. Not very long in the grand scheme, but I&#8217;ve turned over and played with lots of ideas during that time. I wanted to try to take a bit of time to write some of them down. In part to share them, but also to try to lay them bare and try to organize them.</p>

<p>The first application available from the set is the application download tool. This is a conscious decision, chosen because I want the project to reach those who don&#8217;t have PCs. Once we have the application downloader (PalmTorrent) we open up the possible avenue of combined traditional download and viral transmission of the applications. One user with access to a PC can install the downloader and then beam it to others, who can then download the pieces of the suite they want to use. How significant is this class of users, those with network enabled Palm devices of some kind but no PC? Umm&#8230; I have no idea. But it is a class of users I personally am interested in serving, because I want to break the strong connection between the PC and mobile information devices. Enabling mobile users who have access to rich applications without having to rely on a PC is an excellent measuring stick.</p>

<p>The same reason lies behind my desire to run the community mostly through the WINKsite. WINKsite is setup so as to be as inclusive as possible. No matter what kind of device I have in my hand, I can probably bring up the site and view the information there. Sure, there might be better ways to communicate online. But like I said, I would like this project to reach out to those who don&#8217;t have PCs. So communicating through email lists or Yahoo groups or almost anything else, we&#8217;re creating more of a barrier to PDA users than a service for them. So I found something that provides the maximum amount of functionality while being as inclusive as possible in terms of the base of users who can access the information.</p>

<p>This is the user facing part of the project however. I think communication between developers will be much different. I think it is important for the developer community to &#8220;communicate with code&#8221; to a large degree. This means creating a community where developers are comfortable with just picking up an idea they have and hacking code to serve as the basis for discussion about the idea, and being prepared for that reaction to be utter rejection. I think many of the successful collaborative coding projects have followed this form of interaction. The Linux kernel being one of the greatest examples. People that pop up within the Linux community and say &#8220;Hey, I have a great idea for a new feature!!&#8221; are mostly ignored. People who show up and provide a patch for a new feature are just about the only ones who get a non-flame response&#8230; and even those who show up with patches in hand might still get flamed for any of a number of reasons. I think this might be essential to the project&#8217;s success. If the projects admitted all submitted code the project would deteriorate. If the developers took the time to coddle newcomers (and each other) there would be little time left for actually working on the project.</p>

<p>And this is one of the essential tensions that I&#8217;ve been turning over and over in my mind and poking at. How to run a highly inclusive user community around a project which will have to have a selective developer community? All this is still pretty much idle speculation, because the project is barely even starting to lift off. But I think it&#8217;s never too early to start pondering, and hopefully the sooner I start the more prepared I&#8217;ll end up being. I need to go now so that I can follow my own advice and work on some code instead of just talking about it :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went over to the MacWorld expo today. I&#8217;m not a regular Mac user, I just wanted to go. I think the newest Mac operating systems kick ass. Pretty and functional AND stable GUI over a rock solid kernel. This is what computing should be. I&#8217;m a Linux user, thru and thru. Have been for 10 years. But I&#8217;m always on the lookout for cool new stuff. New Macs made it onto the radar. And Mac addicts are always spouting off about how Macs are just an amazing system compared to any form of Windows system. Well.. that is true, but cinder blocks make better desktop systems than Windows PCs do. So that point just doesn&#8217;t impress me.</p>

<p>I admit I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect to be cool about the expo, there just wasn&#8217;t anything that stuck out at all. There were some cool apps, there were some pretty products, there were certainly a lot of people, and there were lots and lots of flat panel displays. But nothing grabbed my attention and really made me want to dig in and find more. What kind of thing would have made me interested? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe my expectations were overinflated, maybe my interests just lie too far out of the norm for most of this stuff to interest me, maybe this was just a slow year. But there just wasn&#8217;t anything there that made me feel I was &#8220;missing out&#8221; on anything by not being a Mac user. And I went there not only receptive to that idea, but actively looking for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/01/05/TheEconomicsOfPiracy.html">an article at Gadgetopia</a> in response to a discussion about piracy and the general economic effects. The discussion centers around the inflated numbers that are thrown around by commercial developers in order to justify the laws they need to get passed. Some interesting points are raised, especially that most pirate users probably wouldn&#8217;t pay full price no matter what. The conclusion I draw from this is that the people hurt the most by piracy might actually be open source projects. Piracy draws potential interest away from free/open source alternatives when users are able to pick up pirated versions of commercial apps. The open source projects lose the marketing effect the user might have, a potential tester and developer, and the pride brought about by swelling ranks of users. Maybe we should help corporations crack down on piracy. They would just end up driving users to the competition and help to fill out the open source projects they compete with. I for one would love to see that.</p>

It lays down the different types of licenses, and goes into detail about the GPL. It also lists some of the common myths about open source and why they&#8217;re really just myths, and lays down some best practices for companies working with or on open source. Certainly worth a read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was wandering around looking for info about why it is that my old Palm m515 doesn&#8217;t work with some WAP sites, and I ran across <a href="http://www.kannel.org/">Kannel</a>, an open source WAP and SMS gateway. I still haven&#8217;t figured out what the hell the deal is with the Palm, but at least now I can pass requests through a local gateway rather than just having to rely on sniffing the requests sent to the gateway. This is one of the many annoyances of WAP, one that I had forgotten about. Your request has to go out to some third party on the Internet, who then passes the request along to the person who actually fulfills it. Not a big deal, proxies exist all over the place, right? Well, what if you&#8217;re a developer, and you suspect that the gateway you&#8217;re sending the request through is mangling it for some reason? Unless you&#8217;re running the service that you&#8217;re accessing as well, you normally can&#8217;t see that. But with Kannel, I can. So here&#8217;s throwing some props their way. I was able to download the package, compile, setup the wap gateway, and pass requests around. I still have lots of debugging to do, but at least now I can do it. Schweet.</p>
