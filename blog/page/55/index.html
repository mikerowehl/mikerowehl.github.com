  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a service called <a href="http://www.tagandscan.com/">TagAndScan</a> available now in the UK. It allows users to leave entries tied to a location, which other users of the service can then come back and view later on. I think of it like a blog with geolocation information, which is something that a number of people have been working on. Of course I would like to see something setup where people can use this information without being tied to a particular service provider (and having to pay to add entries). I won&#8217;t go into the details about why, I think I&#8217;ve already spouted off a bit too much recently regarding my views on companies and their ability to drive the front edge of innovation. But I would point out that while TagAndScan sounds like a really cool service (and kudos to them for deploying a service like this that users seem to be able to access easily), I would point other developers to projects like <a href="http://geourl.org/">GeoURL</a>, which attempt to get users to add geolocation info to their pages, and then provide a way to lookup local info. I would like to work on a palm app that can lookup your location based on address, then use geourl to find places near you and provide hookins to the browsers to allow viewing those locations. Should be pretty simple given what I&#8217;ve seen, but I&#8217;m still a bit of a geolocation newbie. Others who are interested, please <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">contact me</a> or leave a comment here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been kicking around the idea for the <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">Open Palm Environment</a> project for a while now.  I registered the project on Sourceforge in September of last year, so it&#8217;s been at least three months that I&#8217;ve really been actively mulling over the different aspects of the project. Not very long in the grand scheme, but I&#8217;ve turned over and played with lots of ideas during that time. I wanted to try to take a bit of time to write some of them down. In part to share them, but also to try to lay them bare and try to organize them.</p>

<p>The first application available from the set is the application download tool. This is a conscious decision, chosen because I want the project to reach those who don&#8217;t have PCs. Once we have the application downloader (PalmTorrent) we open up the possible avenue of combined traditional download and viral transmission of the applications. One user with access to a PC can install the downloader and then beam it to others, who can then download the pieces of the suite they want to use. How significant is this class of users, those with network enabled Palm devices of some kind but no PC? Umm&#8230; I have no idea. But it is a class of users I personally am interested in serving, because I want to break the strong connection between the PC and mobile information devices. Enabling mobile users who have access to rich applications without having to rely on a PC is an excellent measuring stick.</p>

<p>The same reason lies behind my desire to run the community mostly through the WINKsite. WINKsite is setup so as to be as inclusive as possible. No matter what kind of device I have in my hand, I can probably bring up the site and view the information there. Sure, there might be better ways to communicate online. But like I said, I would like this project to reach out to those who don&#8217;t have PCs. So communicating through email lists or Yahoo groups or almost anything else, we&#8217;re creating more of a barrier to PDA users than a service for them. So I found something that provides the maximum amount of functionality while being as inclusive as possible in terms of the base of users who can access the information.</p>

<p>This is the user facing part of the project however. I think communication between developers will be much different. I think it is important for the developer community to &#8220;communicate with code&#8221; to a large degree. This means creating a community where developers are comfortable with just picking up an idea they have and hacking code to serve as the basis for discussion about the idea, and being prepared for that reaction to be utter rejection. I think many of the successful collaborative coding projects have followed this form of interaction. The Linux kernel being one of the greatest examples. People that pop up within the Linux community and say &#8220;Hey, I have a great idea for a new feature!!&#8221; are mostly ignored. People who show up and provide a patch for a new feature are just about the only ones who get a non-flame response&#8230; and even those who show up with patches in hand might still get flamed for any of a number of reasons. I think this might be essential to the project&#8217;s success. If the projects admitted all submitted code the project would deteriorate. If the developers took the time to coddle newcomers (and each other) there would be little time left for actually working on the project.</p>

<p>And this is one of the essential tensions that I&#8217;ve been turning over and over in my mind and poking at. How to run a highly inclusive user community around a project which will have to have a selective developer community? All this is still pretty much idle speculation, because the project is barely even starting to lift off. But I think it&#8217;s never too early to start pondering, and hopefully the sooner I start the more prepared I&#8217;ll end up being. I need to go now so that I can follow my own advice and work on some code instead of just talking about it :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went over to the MacWorld expo today. I&#8217;m not a regular Mac user, I just wanted to go. I think the newest Mac operating systems kick ass. Pretty and functional AND stable GUI over a rock solid kernel. This is what computing should be. I&#8217;m a Linux user, thru and thru. Have been for 10 years. But I&#8217;m always on the lookout for cool new stuff. New Macs made it onto the radar. And Mac addicts are always spouting off about how Macs are just an amazing system compared to any form of Windows system. Well.. that is true, but cinder blocks make better desktop systems than Windows PCs do. So that point just doesn&#8217;t impress me.</p>

<p>I admit I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect to be cool about the expo, there just wasn&#8217;t anything that stuck out at all. There were some cool apps, there were some pretty products, there were certainly a lot of people, and there were lots and lots of flat panel displays. But nothing grabbed my attention and really made me want to dig in and find more. What kind of thing would have made me interested? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe my expectations were overinflated, maybe my interests just lie too far out of the norm for most of this stuff to interest me, maybe this was just a slow year. But there just wasn&#8217;t anything there that made me feel I was &#8220;missing out&#8221; on anything by not being a Mac user. And I went there not only receptive to that idea, but actively looking for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/01/05/TheEconomicsOfPiracy.html">an article at Gadgetopia</a> in response to a discussion about piracy and the general economic effects. The discussion centers around the inflated numbers that are thrown around by commercial developers in order to justify the laws they need to get passed. Some interesting points are raised, especially that most pirate users probably wouldn&#8217;t pay full price no matter what. The conclusion I draw from this is that the people hurt the most by piracy might actually be open source projects. Piracy draws potential interest away from free/open source alternatives when users are able to pick up pirated versions of commercial apps. The open source projects lose the marketing effect the user might have, a potential tester and developer, and the pride brought about by swelling ranks of users. Maybe we should help corporations crack down on piracy. They would just end up driving users to the competition and help to fill out the open source projects they compete with. I for one would love to see that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031231092027900">an article at Groklaw</a> by the General Counsel of Red Hat Inc. about what exactly open source software is, the groundings of open source in copyright law, and how those rights are managed by open source licenses to enact the different goals embodied in different types of open source projects. It lays down the different types of licenses, and goes into detail about the GPL. It also lists some of the common myths about open source and why they&#8217;re really just myths, and lays down some best practices for companies working with or on open source. Certainly worth a read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was wandering around looking for info about why it is that my old Palm m515 doesn&#8217;t work with some WAP sites, and I ran across <a href="http://www.kannel.org/">Kannel</a>, an open source WAP and SMS gateway. I still haven&#8217;t figured out what the hell the deal is with the Palm, but at least now I can pass requests through a local gateway rather than just having to rely on sniffing the requests sent to the gateway. This is one of the many annoyances of WAP, one that I had forgotten about. Your request has to go out to some third party on the Internet, who then passes the request along to the person who actually fulfills it. Not a big deal, proxies exist all over the place, right? Well, what if you&#8217;re a developer, and you suspect that the gateway you&#8217;re sending the request through is mangling it for some reason? Unless you&#8217;re running the service that you&#8217;re accessing as well, you normally can&#8217;t see that. But with Kannel, I can. So here&#8217;s throwing some props their way. I was able to download the package, compile, setup the wap gateway, and pass requests around. I still have lots of debugging to do, but at least now I can do it. Schweet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today most of my time was taken up fooling around with getting the XMLRPC library for the <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">Open Palm Environment</a> at least chugging along. It&#8217;s shaping up pretty quick, but I know it will be at least a couple of days worth of work before I have it parsing actual XMLRPC requests. Parts of this are due to my still being pretty recently returned to Palm programming. The work I&#8217;ve done on <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> is just about the only serious Palm work I&#8217;ve done in the last 3 years or so. So I&#8217;m still getting back into it. And this is also the first time in a while that I&#8217;m starting a low level XML parser from scratch. Normally, when working on desktop systems, writing on top of the expat style stream parser interface isn&#8217;t done any more. You use a DOM based interface, or grab one of a number of existing projects and massage it into a new form.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s really what get me thinking along the lines of balancing actually doing new work with running around and looking at what others have done and then integrating it. A lot of what I do is picking up existing peices and hooking them together. Software engineering says this is good, I shouldn&#8217;t be rewriting from scratch all the time. And I&#8217;m someone who gets lots of reuse out of other people&#8217;s projects. I&#8217;ve been pounding away on getting the XMLRPC parsing working for only a few hours, and I  started wondering why I was getting frusterated with how long it was taking. It&#8217;s pretty abnormal for me to be writing something this far down the stack of operations, or at least that&#8217;s the first thing that popped to mind. But then I realized that I do a good amount of Linux device driver work, which is certainly low level. I think what has happened is that the last few weeks worth of surfing around at random, reading news, quick comments in this blog, and superficial toying with new projects has already started to take its toll with respect to my attention span. When I think back on it, as recently as 3 months ago it was normal for me to spend a whole week banging away on a new feature or two. But now spending even part of a weekend working towards something has left me on edge. That&#8217;s probably not good. What I should do is sit down and actually hack through a good chunk of the projects I&#8217;ve been mulling over. It would probably take me a few weeks almost full time just to get through 3 or 4 of them. But at least it would put me back into the right frame of mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4124">entry in Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s blog</a> regarding the evolution of software into systems that link together services running on multiple devices. I think would prove particularly beneficial for mobile computing. Personally, I don&#8217;t care for the sync-to-the-desktop model that devices like Palm handhelds try for. I would much rather see applications that allow for handhelds to serve as smaller access portals to the same applications which are used from desktops. Keeping the PDA in the role of a desktop peripheral kills much of the value I think a portable device can add. However, I do agree that most applications aren&#8217;t well suited to any other form of use currently. A move in the direction of the kinds of services that Tim describes there would get us a bit closer.</p>
