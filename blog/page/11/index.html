  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a good one from Bruce: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/08/identity_thief.html">Identity Thief Steals House</a>. He links to one of his older essays, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/04/mitigating_iden.html">Mitigating Identity Theft</a>. Definitely worth a read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the solutions being proposed in Congress won&#8217;t help. To see why, we need to start with the basics. The very term &#8220;identity theft&#8221; is an oxymoron. Identity is not a possession that can be acquired or lost; it&#8217;s not a thing at all. Someone&#8217;s identity is the one thing about a person that cannot be stolen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The real crime here is fraud; more specifically, impersonation leading to fraud. Impersonation is an ancient crime, but the rise of information-based credentials gives it a modern spin. A criminal impersonates a victim online and steals money from his account. He impersonates a victim in order to deceive financial institutions into granting credit to the criminal in the victim&#8217;s name. He impersonates a victim to the Post Office and gets the victim&#8217;s address changed. He impersonates a victim in order to fool the police into arresting the wrong man. No one&#8217;s identity is stolen; identity information is being misused to commit fraud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was linked off Slashdot, so I&#8217;m sure everyone and their grandmother has already seen it, but <a href="http://zone-mr.net/?act=entry&amp;id=36">here&#8217;s a story about some folks tracking down a cell phone theif</a>. Besides liking the final bit:</p>

<blockquote><p>Moral of the story - even if you&#8217;re enough of a cunt to steal from a charity raffle, don&#8217;t be fucktarded enough to steal a phone from a community of phone experts.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s cool that they found the theif and all, got their phone back. W00t, and so on. But I don&#8217;t like the idea of people being able to track me due to my actions online. And lots of the current structure of mobile communications enforces a coupling between my identity and my activity online. Not that it has to, it&#8217;s intentially setup that way to &#8220;prevent abuse&#8221;. <sarcasm>Which works just smashingly!</sarcasm> I don&#8217;t know, just kinda stuck me weird. I must be spending too much time trawling hacking boards in my quest for a <a href="http://blog.davidkaspar.com/archives/2005/07/psp_firmware_20_is_out.php">buffer overflow attack against the PSP browser</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html">interesting tidbit from the Google Talk developer info:</a> (hat tip <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050824-5234.html">arstechnica</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>We look forward to federating with any service provider who shares our belief in enabling user choice and open communications. We do believe, however, that it is important to balance openness with ensuring that we maintain a safe and reliable service that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses. We are using the federation opportunity with EarthLink and Sipphone to develop a set of guidelines by which all members of the federated network can work together to ensure that we protect our users while maximizing the reach of the network. We are also eager to hear from other people in the industry about how best to build a federation model that is open, scalable, and ensures best-in-class user experiences.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah, I get it. Someone <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=549#comments">commented on my last post about Google Talk</a> about server to server and federation, Google is working on it. I guess this is what they meant. I just wanted to weigh in and say that I don&#8217;t consider this open, just cause I know everyone is dying to know what I think. Open means open, as in services can interact without someone having to approve them. This describes a closed environment. Closed for all the right reasons, but closed none the less. It&#8217;s definitely possible to do bad things with good intentions. This is one of them. Closing a service to prevent spam now just hurts the platform overall in the long run. Go read <a href="http://www.code-is-law.org/">Code and other Laws of Cyberspace</a> if you haven&#8217;t already by the way, it&#8217;s killer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had a background task running that steals a few cycles whenever I should be sleeping and checks out what it would get to make the laptop I have from work do WPA. I have a Thinkpad R51 I inherited, and while I wait for my laptop to come in I&#8217;ve been playing around with it to see what I could get working. The work wireless network uses WPA-PSK, and that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always been a pain for Linux. So here&#8217;s my quick description of getting the Thinkpad R51 (using the <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">Intel ipw2200</a> driver) working with WPA. I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> as the distro by the way, 5.04 in particular. So maybe these instructions will actually be relevant to someone!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ipw2200 driver that ships with the default kernel in Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t have support for a lot of the operations that the WPA setup requires. I started out with a fresh download of the latest stable kernel (2.6.12.5 as of this writing) just to head off any potential issues with newness of versions. This is pretty bleeding edge stuff (there are Makefiles at least, so it could be worse :-).</p></li>
<li><p>Grab the config from /boot and copy it to .config in your new kernel area, make menuconfig and resave, compile, install, generally get the system working with that new kernel</p></li>
<li><p>Grab the <a href="http://ieee80211.sourceforge.net/">ieee80211 subsystem</a>, I used the latest as of this writing, 1.0.3. The compile and install is very easy here (Yay for installed kernel headers!!).</p></li>
<li><p>Now grab the <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">driver for the network card, ipw2200</a>. I used 1.0.6, which was the latest as of this writing. You&#8217;ll also need the latest firmware, also linked to from the ipw2200 page. The releases of firmware are numbered according to which versions of the driver they go with. The firmware I grabbed started with 1.0.4 and ran through the current version. Compile and install the ipw2200 driver, copy the firmwares into place (I used /lib/hotplug/firmware).</p></li>
<li><p>And finally you&#8217;ll need a copy of <a href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/">wpa_supplicant</a>. This is where things start to get really sketchy. This is bleeding edge for you. You&#8217;ll have to create a configuration file for the package in order to build it.  Here&#8217;s what mine looks like:
`CONFIG_DRIVER_IPW=y</p>

<h1>CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD=y</h1>

<h1>CONFIG_DRIVER_NDIS=y</h1>

CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXTENSION=y
CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y
CONFIG_EAP_MD5=y
CONFIG_EAP_MSCHAPV2=y
CONFIG_EAP_TLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_PEAP=y
CONFIG_EAP_TTLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_GTC=y
CONFIG_EAP_OTP=y

<h1>CONFIG_EAP_SIM=y</h1>

<h1>CONFIG_EAP_AKA=y</h1>

CONFIG_EAP_PSK=y
CONFIG_EAP_PAX=y
CONFIG_EAP_LEAP=y

<h1>CONFIG_PCSC=y</h1>

<p>`I coppied wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli to /usr/local/bin, although I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s superfluous.</p></li>
<li><p>Then take the wpa_supplicant.conf sample file and tailor it to your needs. I just followed the example from in there that most closely matched my setup.</p></li>
<li><p>Run wpa_supplicant giving it the interface to use and the configuration file: &#8220;wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -d&#8221; The -d option keeps it in the foreground so you can see all the debugging output. If it works you should see messages saying that it&#8217;s associated with a basestation and extablished a key.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Tada! Now you can run scripts against the interface to do things like DHCP and everything should be all peachy. Sweet! Now I don&#8217;t have to use a Windows machine just so I can tool around the office downloading stuff and looking like I&#8217;m important.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, not that I have the time to play with something new, but I had to get this out of my system cause I haven&#8217;t seen other comments yet (Well, except <a href="http://www.decaffeinated.org/archives/2005/08/25/googletalk">this one</a>). One of the reasons I got really jazzed about <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a> running XMPP underneath is because XMPP is a more distributed protocol than the IM systems. What I mean by that is that there&#8217;s supposed to be server to server communication. Even though I run my own Jabber server at bitsplitter.net I can still talk to folks at jabber.org because the servers figure out how to talk. Kinda like the way email gets from one place to another. When the jabber.org server sees thatguymike@bitsplitter.net, jabber.org knows to open a connection to bitsplitter.net and start delivering messages. So not only can you create plugins to Jabber by creating things that emulate clients, you can toss a whole server into the mix. And all the other servers can communicate with it by default cause the domain based naming scheme for Jabber accounts takes care of telling the server how to find each other. Sweet.  Except this doesn&#8217;t seem to be true for talk.google.com. My username is &#8220;miker@gmail.com&#8221; but the service to connect to is at talk.google.com. Hmm.  Maybe miker@gmail.com@talk.google.com works? Doesn&#8217;t seem like it. Maybe from the Google Talk side I can add my bitsplitter.net account? No go, looks like the Google Talk folks have server to server communication off. That sucks. Turn it on!</p>

<p>Also, here&#8217;s an idea I would like to try, but I don&#8217;t have time for. Maybe if you do you can. I can&#8217;t get any of the normal dedicated Jabber clients to talk to Google Talk (<a href="http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Gossip">Gossip</a> or <a href="http://gabber.sourceforge.net/">Gabber</a> for example). Why would it matter? Because Jabber also supports something called services. These are server side goodies to keep all sorts of neat info or provide extension functions. Examples: directories of users on the system, info about the group chat rooms, or gateways into other protocols or sources of information. What&#8217;s installed on that Google Talk server?  What services are there? Without allowing server to server communication the extensibility of the platform is really in question. Dumb. But maybe there are some other goodies in there for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I snagged a PSP a while ago, figuring it would be fun for games but mostly wanting to hack on it. Sony really doesn&#8217;t like people being able to do what they want with Sony devices, so the thing is rife with all sorts of crippling roadblocks to innovation (I think the technical term for this is DRM, but I just call it teh suq). Unfortunately my PSP had an updated firmware when I got it from the store, so I haven&#8217;t been able to install any software on it. I&#8217;ve been eagerly awaiting the release of <a href="http://www.pspworld.com/sony-psp/psp/psp-20-update-now-available-001314.php">the PSP 2.0 firmware</a> (PSP World). Why? Well, as far as I know no one has a hack for these versions. However, the 2.0 firmware does have a web browser, and browsers are normally buggy and nasty bits of code. Especially in their earlier versions. I&#8217;m really curious if there are any buffer overflows or similar defects in the browser that could be used to execute arbitrary code. Anyone else wondering the same thing? Does the PSP have a non-executable stack? I haven&#8217;t been following PSP-dev so I have no idea. Of course, even with a protected stack there&#8217;s plenty of <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5QP0L0AFFS.html">nasty kinda stuff to be done</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?CommunityModelling">session on Community Modelling from BARcamp</a> got me thinking about large scale simulations again, so I&#8217;ve been reading Terra Nova more carefully than before. This article really caught my eye today, <a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2005/08/i_say_tomato_yo.html">Terra Nova: I say tomato. You say it’s a warm day</a>. I loved this quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>It makes me wonder if the reason Asians are willing to tolerate, en masse, online worlds with relatively primitive graphics (Lineage, for instance) is partially explained by the cultural difference this study demonstrated. To a Westerner who focuses immediately on the individual models, Lineage may seem far more primitive than to someone who may try to focus on the image as a whole. I really have no idea if that’s true or not, but there’s no doubt that there are certain fundamental differences in how the two cultures look at the graphics in games (much less look at gameplay). It also makes me wonder what Blizzard has done that appeals so strongly to both Westerners and Easterners in terms of visual style. I won’t presume to guess, but it’s an interesting thought to think.</p></blockquote>

<p>I still remain most interested in text based games actually, and worlds that allow their participants to have a high degree of involvement in shaping them. I like worlds where the users can create their own objects and spaces, and script or otherwise dictate behaviors. And I have always been more interested in the overall relationships between elements in the virtual worlds than the details. The relationships between the virtual worlds and and real world are interesting too. Like the moves that some of the gaming companies have made to <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/TopPlayers.aspx?hop=3">expose stats in their online systems via web interfaces</a>. I&#8217;ve yet to spend much time in <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>, I would probably disappear completely from public life if something like that happened. Second Life doesn&#8217;t have a Linux client do they? That would majorly rock.</p>

And I&#8217;m sitting here drinking my Mountain Dew like a sucker. Now I admit it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been to the zoo, but I do see the occasional monkey flick on one of the nature channels. It doesn&#8217;t seem to me that there would be a real market in monkey stimulants. Except maybe for the big guy, who had tanks and airplanes to contend with while carying a screaming Faye Wray. That looked pretty stressful. I just can&#8217;t see your average monkey pulling too many 30-36 hour hacking sprees. Now silicon Valley, there&#8217;s some monkeys who could use &#8220;facilitated attentional processes related to speed.&#8221; It would have come in really handy at <a href="http://barcamp.org">BARcamp</a> I bet.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are two great posts over at <a href="http://lue.dyn.dhs.org/index.html">Linux, Unit, /etc/</a>:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://lue.dyn.dhs.org/2005/20050722134020.html">Unix Web Hacks</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Together they describe both M4 and how to make use of it to carry out some webbish tasks like wrapping content in common markup. I know, I know. &#8220;Der, just use WordPress or something.&#8221; No. Software comes from somewhere, and the people who make it need to learn how to do things. For every useful and interesting hack there are at least 10 stupid little prototypes, tests, mashups, and minor modifications. The closer your starting point can be to your ending point the better off you (probably) are. More examples using more toolsets for more problems, that&#8217;s cool. So generating HTML with a macro processor that has roots back into Fortran, sure, that&#8217;s cool. I don&#8217;t want to do it right now, but if ever I&#8217;m looking for an example to start with I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be happy it&#8217;s there.</p>
