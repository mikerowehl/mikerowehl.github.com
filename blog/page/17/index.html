  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/04/fab_friday_.html">Future Salon with Neil Gershenfeld</a>. Raw notes, you know the deal, maybe cleaner stuff coming later.</p>

<p>Talking about big bits, when the &#8220;bits become smaller than the network&#8221;. Initially like morse code, time is the only factor. IP over DC power. Showed off serving web pages from a small embedded board, about a dollar in parts.</p>

<p>End to end modulation, interdevice networking, the state can go to the edges. Not optimal for any one use, but interoperable. Internet zero, powerline to RFID to optical. RFID, the tag is a packet and includes instructions about what to do.</p>

<p>Paintable computing, make the smallest chips you can afford and put them in a viscous medium and paint them out where you need them. Used postscript for display as an example, a wall figuring out how to display a letter.  You can shoot a hole in it, if you have twice as much it&#8217;s just twice as big.</p>

<p>State of the art fabrication? Not chips, the ribosome protein.  Three base code is an error correcting code, redundent. This is a computing machine, state machine, computing to build.</p>

<p>Magnetic tiles that form letters, write a code into the material and the material holds the restrictions necessary to form the shape desired.</p>

<p>When you engineer generally more noise means more errors, and if you&#8217;re a good engineer you can modify that line down a bit but not much. If you add information and then remove it you hit a threshold with nonzero noise and perfect performance. Threshold theorems. We are macroscopic things built out of imperfect little parts.</p>

<p>Theory of self-reproducing automata, John Von Neumann.  Reliable computation in the presence of noise.</p>

<p>How to make almost anything started as a class to teach people how to use some equiptment they had on campus at MIT.</p>

<p>fab.cba.mit.edu/~shellyle was the URL of a page that he had up. Looks like it&#8217;s still live.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been living with a mistake made in the renaissance that actually making stuff isn&#8217;t liberating. That making stuff isn&#8217;t in itself a means of expression.</p>

<p>Computers becomming accessable to workgroups rather than organizations as a whole (like mainframes) was what gave rise to all the usefull stuff we think about when we think about computers now. This led to a project to put together a set of tools to produce micrometer and microsecond level technology. Goal is to get the fab to the point where it can build a fab. Fab Labs.</p>

<p>Instead of bringing tools to the masses, bring the means to create tools to the masses. The capability to create information technolgies that fit the problems and can be modified.</p>

<p>We are in the minicomputer era of personal fab.</p>

<p>Neil is interested in how you cross VC with microfinance. He should talk to Stuart Gannes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using a PowerBook G4 for just about a month. It&#8217;s pretty nice actually, I like the environment quite a bit. And it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve had a nice modern laptop to use. Normally I have some rejected hardware kept alive through the necromantic power of <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>. Today I had my first real disappointment though. I use the builtin Bluetooth to connect to my phone and use my GPRS connection from my laptop on my way back and forth on Caltrain. It&#8217;s nice and slick, I just whip out my laptop and click on the little phone dealie, and magically I have a connection (well, after I downloaded the dialup scripts that actually use GPRS instead of just <em>saying</em> they support GPRS, but that&#8217;s another issue). Every once in a while the Internet Connect app apparently hangs however. I&#8217;ll try to disconnect and that little phone handset up in the menu bar will constantly scroll &#8220;Disconnecting&#8230;&#8221; and never stop. Of course, I can&#8217;t form another connection at this point, as the menu affords only a &#8220;disconnect&#8221; option, something which is apparently already and process and not affected by repeated frusterated clicking. I tried all sorts of clueless noob stuff like shutting off the bluetooth and turning it back on, putting the system to sleep and waking it up, turning off my phone and trying to clear the connections on it (holding down the hangup key on a Nokia apparently clear all open descriptors for all connections by the way), and even killing the apparently hung pppd out from under the Internet Connect tool. Nothing worked though, so I would just reboot the system. It happens pretty infrequently, and when it does happen I&#8217;m normally in no mood to dig at the issue. It happened this morning however, and I was finally ready to deal with it. So I left the &#8220;Disconnecting&#8230;&#8221; scrolling and found an access point to search out potential solutions. Google turned up nothing. Some mentions of people saying they&#8217;ve also seen the Internet Connect hang when disconnecting and they had to reboot. But no proposed solutions. So I decide to give the folks at Apple a call and find out how to reset a hung Internet Connect. Their answer is to reboot the system!!!! I was floored. There&#8217;s apparently no way to deal with this hung process except to reboot the system. So we have a Mach microkernel running an abstracted visual user interface&#8230; but if I want to use Bluetooth to form an outbound connection sometimes I might have to reboot to do it a second time? I don&#8217;t even have words for that. To me it seems odd that the &#8220;super-modern operating system that combines the power and stability of UNIX with the legendary elegance of the Macintosh&#8221; would require a reboot after using Bluetooth. Perhaps the good folks at Apple have a slightly different definition of super-modern in mind than I do? An unavoidable and unpredictable persistently nonfunctional state arising from normal usage is not what I would consider a trait of any operating system at all, let alone an super-modern one. And a forced reboot is about as elegant as an icepick lobotomy. Disappointed. I&#8217;m very very disappointed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=485">raw notes</a> yesterday for this event, here&#8217;s the cleaned up version.  The event was <a href="http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20050412b/">&#8220;Recent Innovations in Search and Other Ways of Finding Information&#8221;</a>. There&#8217;s going to be audio of the event posted, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s going to be to the <a href="http://www.baychi.org/">BayCHI site</a> or somewhere else. The panel started with a 5 minute show and tell by each panelist, they had slides or walked through the tools they&#8217;re working on.</p>

<p>Panelists</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Peter Norvig</p></li>
<li><p>Ken Norton</p></li>
<li><p>Mark Fletcher</p></li>
<li><p>Udi Manber</p></li>
<li><p>Jakob Nielsen</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Peter Norvig</p>

<p>Talked about the newly released question and answer feature on Google, where you can ask a question in natural language and get a direct answer back. The example he gave was &#8220;what is population of japan&#8221;. The facts for the database are extracted from the web overall, using statistical analysis because most facts tend to be represented multiple times.  Accuracy is still a problem however.</p>

<p>He then spoke about search by SMS.  They&#8217;re seeing more and more demand for mobile services.  They&#8217;ve added maps to the cell phone interface as well.  The Google maps interface has recently grown the ability to switch to a satellite view mode.  He showed satellite views within google maps of a few interesting landmarks like Niagra Falls and the white horse in new mexico.</p>

<p>Then Google suggest, where the searchbox suggestion list is populated behind the scenes by google as you type.  In particular he referenced the <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX model</a> (hat tip to Jesse James Garrett) that Google has been pushing.  Used in both maps and the suggest feature.  Then an example of Google desktop search, indexing local files and information for users and mixing it into search results.  Showed an example of a search combining results from out on the web and on the users own machine.</p>

<p>Ken Norton</p>

<p>First slide said &#8220;Enable people to find, use, share and expand all human knowledge&#8221;.  Most people working on search are only adressing that first part, how to help people find information.  Yahoo wants to be involved in all parts of that series. Reference to remixing and remaking (author note: alla <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2005/02/24/lessig.html">Lessig&#8217;s remix culture</a>).  Then showed a big list of projects that Yahoo has in beta or released. Desktop search, creative commons search, the search API (YDN), mobile search, whole bunch of stuff that went by too quick to capture all of them.</p>

<p>Talked in particular about MyYahooSearch, which is in beta but will be released soon. The service will give users more control over their searches, allowing them to save and share.  Like bookmarking, but hopefully a step beyond with respect to sharing and enhancing.  Video search is up now. That&#8217;s something they wouldn&#8217;t have considered 3 years ago because there wasn&#8217;t enough content. Now the content and the demand is there. He mentioned <a href="http://tools.search.yahoo.com/mrss/">MediaRSS</a> as the way to share your content back out after remixing it.  They also have a desktop search.</p>

<p>Y!Q is an effort to &#8220;bring search back to the point of inspiration&#8221;.  Every search happens for a reason, it starts at a place where someone realizes there&#8217;s something they want more info about.  That context is potentially valuable info. What kind of context should be captured and how should it be given to the engine?  How is the information represented to the user? The example given was reading a court decision and looking for related stories in the news. The interface shown was a floating popup with the news links appearing over the court decision page.</p>

<p>Mobile search is also big with them, users are demanding multiple access modes.  Creative Commons search was also driven by customer demand, users were asking for content that they could reuse in their own work. Also referenced the Yahoo purchase of Flickr, a photosharing and community site. The hope is to integrate the DNA from Flickr with repect to understanding of how users tag and share and expand on content and cary that throughout Yahoo.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next at Yahoo? Personal search, contextual search, multimedia search, desktop search, local search, travel search, social media. Check out <a href="http://next.yahoo.com">next.yahoo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Mark Fletcher</p>

<p>Mark did a walkthrough of Bloglines to show the functions. The tool is divided up into four areas: search, subscribe, share, publish.  That should provide the full lifecycle of blogging that people would want. He started Bloglines to scratch his own itch, he had bookmarks for a hundred sites he had to visit every day. Talked about information overload, blog content is the fastest growing area of web content. 1.6 million articles added every day.</p>

<p>Sidenote: Mark has 29 feeds in his own account (at least the one he demoed with) Showed how to use the search built into Bloglines.  It&#8217;s a keyword search you can do across all content or across feeds you&#8217;re subscribed to. If you hit the save button you can subscribe to the query, and it&#8217;ll cull out new occurances of the keywords in articles and feed them to you.  The example of a search feed he has is a keyword search for &#8220;Bloglines&#8221; within his aggregators folder.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s coming from Bloglines? Search friends, filter articles.</p>

<p>Udi Manber</p>

<p>Udi spoke about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/104-6832396-8708716?node=3999141">Yellow Pages</a>, which launched in January. It includes a function that lets you walk down the street virtually. When you click left and right you can see pictures taken at regular intervals.  He did a quick demo of the function and everyone was amazed (gasps and &#8220;oooh, ahhh&#8221;).  Very obvious that everyone was impressed.  He gave an example of why you would want a function like that.  If you gave directions to a place by saying &#8220;It&#8217;s this place right next to that place on main street&#8221; that used to mean that you couldn&#8217;t find the information you wanted online. Now you can find &#8220;that place on main&#8221; and just walk next door to see what it&#8217;s called, and complete your search.</p>

<p>He gave some details about how they actually went about putting the site together.  Showed the rental SUV with the camera on top that took the pictures. The camera is hooked up to a laptop with GPS and some special software that tells them were they&#8217;ve been already and shows them were images have been taken.  The driver just looks at the map onscreen and drives, the system does pretty much everything else.  Udi himself spent two days driving the route in Arizona, it was a lot of fun.  Showed a video of the time the intern who had to drive Washington DC was stopped by the police.  The police asked him &#8220;is there any tape in the camera&#8221;, to which he replied no, cause the thing records straight to hard drive.  The police didn&#8217;t think about that though, so now there&#8217;s a half hour video of the police talking to the intern.  This holds a good lesson for search, you have to ask the right questions.</p>

<p>Jakob Nielsen</p>

<p>Started off with a table showing that since 1994 we have almost a 100% change in usage. People used to use one word in searches in 1994, and they use on average 2 words in 2004.  This is probably a continuing growth curve, up to a point.  We probably will see three search terms in a few years.  Probably won&#8217;t ever make it up to something like ten terms, should plateau somewhere in there. People will never use complex queries and boolean operators in large numbers.</p>

<p>How many people are successful in their searches? 42% for all searches.  That divides up into about 32% success rate for inexperienced users and 50% for the experienced user.  When using internal search on a website it&#8217;s about 33%, and when it&#8217;s one of the big external search engines it&#8217;s 56%.</p>

<p>Says that search on websites is a miserable failure.  It&#8217;s a deisgrace that we&#8217;ve allowed search on websites to be so bad, and intranets are even worse. It&#8217;s the most prevalent problem actually.</p>

<p>He then showed a video of a recorded session of someone trying to search. The search interface being used was AOL.  There were multiple fields on the page and the user first entered their search text into the wrong field but pushed the search button.  They got no results.  So they clicked the search button a few more times on the results page, still getting no results.  Next stop is the help function, which isn&#8217;t that helpful.  She enters something like &#8220;www.head.ache.com&#8221; into the location bar for the next attempt.  The site isn&#8217;t found, but the browser has a search box on the error page.  She presses the search button without entering any text, but the browser tells her that&#8217;s an error and that she should type text in the box. She&#8217;s thrown for a bit by the modal dialog box telling her that she must enter text, but eventually she dismisses it, enters a search, and gets a results page.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  Now questions from the moderator</p>

<p>First question is to ask the other pannelists to reply to &#8220;search on websites is a miserable failure&#8221; statement that Jakob made.</p>

<p>Udi - Says that it&#8217;s not a failure, 50% is good.  It&#8217;s a hard problem.  In the example given it was AOL search, who have massive resources to put behind making their search good. When you have a small site and very small resource pool to pull from how can you hope to fulfill well?  The small sites just can&#8217;t do it, it&#8217;s not plug and play enough and standardized.</p>

<p>Mark - There&#8217;s a lot of work to be done, but it&#8217;s not just search. In the movie that Jakob showed the user was having basic issues, like using the mouse and understanding the layout of the browser. Computers overall have to be more usable, not just the search interfaces that they present.</p>

<p>Peter - The same thing happened to him with the IBM site when he was looking means something.</p>

<p>Ken - More and more people are using the general internet search with site restricts to do their search.  Before you do it on your own, think about using one of the existing engines out there instead.</p>

<p>QUESTION - How have searchers (people performing searches) evolved besides simply using more words in their queries?</p>

<p>Ken - Demand for better search tools in vertical areas.  People used to be happy with general queries in the search engine, now they want the context to be appropriate to their task.  Yahoo is looking at the different categories that users seearch in and trying to figure out what goes in those different areas.  How do you make the user aware of it once you have it.  The results page is a poor place to message to users about features and functionality.</p>

<p>Peter - Verticals also, very important. International also really stands out for Google.  Majority of traffic is outside of US and not in English.</p>

<p>Mark - I&#8217;m the new guy at Ask, so here&#8217;s what others told me they&#8217;re seeing: the query length at Ask Jeeves is getting shorter actually, oposite of what most others are seeing. This is because people realize it&#8217;s not JUST natural language at Ask, you can enter keyword searches as well.  The long tail has grown even longer.  Vast major part of queries are completely unique. Expectations have grown, searches are successful, people search more, feedback loop.</p>

<p>Udi - The size of the search box actually influences the length of the search terms.  Also thinks vertical is important.  Opensearch, syndicated search for opening search and sharing it.  Anybody can take search results and put it on A9.</p>

<p>Jakob - People use search because they are selfish, because they don&#8217;t want to endure the interfaces that most sites inflict on them.  That applies to both site specific searches and general search engines. If sites did use more standard and humane design (site maps, richer navigation) that might not be the case.  It has to be standard design though, not a one off trick for each site.</p>

<p>QUESTION - How do you give access to the different verticals without turning into a portal?</p>

<p>Ken - The web search box IS the interface.  That&#8217;s what people want.  Don&#8217;t direct people to different areas, just figure out the context and provide them with it in place.  Rather than asking users to adapt ask the search engine to be smarter.  Is this a local query? Is this a shopping query? Find the users intent.  Users have gotten confident.  That used to be the greatest problem, but it&#8217;s not the case any more.  They expect good results.</p>

<p>Udi - Some queries work well and others don&#8217;t.  &#8220;What&#8217;s the population of India&#8221; works even without any natural language processing because it&#8217;s an objective question.  &#8220;What&#8217;s the best TV to buy&#8221; does not because of that term &#8220;best&#8221;.  How do we balance ease of use and powerful tools?</p>

<p>Peter - We&#8217;ve failed in terms of letting the user have a dialog.  Search is a command line without a documented interface.  How do we put advice in place to help guide users to what they want?  We&#8217;re getting there but it&#8217;s nothing like walking into a library and getting help from the librarian.</p>

<p>*** Someone on the panel asked how many people in the audience have read advanced help for any search engine. Lots had. That&#8217;s atypical, in the average group not many have, if any at all.</p>

<p>QUESTION - Are folksonomy/tagging a fundamentally different form of data than what&#8217;s there already for search?</p>

<p>Udi - It&#8217;s all just metadata, it&#8217;s our job to deal with it.  It&#8217;s not any different, except that hopefully its coming from more sources.</p>

<p>Ken - It&#8217;s remarkable in that it&#8217;s just like what we already deal with.  Right now all the information we have is provided by web authors, and now with tagging we can collect from a larger group of people.  The more metadata the better.  The more we can get from users and not authors the better off we should be.</p>

<p>Jakob - We won&#8217;t get much more info from users. With tagging the barrier is lower, but it&#8217;s still there. We have to get passive data out of people, eyeball time and metrics from the desktop.</p>

<p>Ken - If they find value they&#8217;ll do it.</p>

<p>Jakob - Okay, like spam marking in collaborative filter.</p>

<p>Udi - Mapr maps Flickr images onto a map display.  Lots of the images appear in Maine, cause people tag with &#8220;me&#8221; (as in myself), but Mapr thinks it&#8217;s an abbreviation for the state Maine.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are questions from the audience now.  These are just the cool bits I particularly liked.</p>

<p>Udi - A9 keeps context.  If you repeat a search 4 months after the initial date at which you performed it you&#8217;ll get a message that says &#8220;these results are new, you haven&#8217;t seen them before&#8221; and you&#8217;ll be presented with the information that&#8217;s been added to the index since the last time you searched. And &#8220;these are the items you clicked on last time you searched&#8221; so that you know what you&#8217;ve already hit.</p>

<p>Someone from the audience asked under what circumstances the panel didn&#8217;t use search.  I really liked the answer from Jakob.</p>

<p>Jakob - People do not search when they&#8217;re loyal customers of someone.  If you&#8217;re a loyal customer of Amazon you don&#8217;t search for books on Google, you go directly to Amazon to make your purchase.</p>

<p>Someone asked if the search wars were going to be defined in terms of branding and not tech. All seemed to think it was still a tech race. In that regard the industry is still evolving. There have been times in the past when the search war was thought to be over, but something always comes up and changes the game. The same is true now, there&#8217;s plenty of evolution to go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are notes from the &#8221;<a href="http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20050412b/">Recent Innovations in Search and Other Ways of Finding Information</a>&#8221; panel at BayCHI. It was an absolutely fantastic panel! Very well done, the panelists were great all around (although personally I think I liked the contributions from <a href="http://manber.com/">Udi</a> the most). I&#8217;ll have to come back at some points and clean up these notes, they&#8217;re in kinda rough shape.</p>

<p>Panelists:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Peter Norvig</p></li>
<li><p>Mark Fletcher</p></li>
<li><p>Udi Manber</p></li>
<li><p>Ken Norton</p></li>
<li><p>Jakob Nielsen</p></li>
</ul>


<p>5 minute show and tell by each panelist</p>

<p>Peter -
talked about question and answer &#8220;what is population of japan&#8221; was the example</p>

<p>extracted facts from the web</p>

<p>facts are represented many times, accuracy is a problem</p>

<p>then search by sms - people are using more andmore mobile</p>

<p>maps on the cell phone</p>

<p>then google maps overall - plus ssatelite photos</p>

<p>niagra falls, white horse</p>

<p>predictive seach - google suggest</p>

<p>talked about AJAX in particular - google has been pushing it Jesse Garrett</p>

<p>Google desktop search - example combining both desktop and the web</p>

<p>Ken -
Enable people to find, use, share and expand all human knowledge</p>

<p>most people addressing only the find part, yahoo wants to do all</p>

<p>remixing and remaking</p>

<p>desktop/creative commons, YDN, big list of things they did</p>

<p>MyYahooSearch - in beta, released soon
gives users more control, allows to save and share, like bookmarking but hopefully a step beyond.</p>

<p>video search - huge ammount of content out there, huge demand, that&#8217;s new</p>

<p>mediarss - allows people to submit their content back after remixing</p>

<p>desktop search</p>

<p>Y!Q - bringing search to the point of inspiration - there is context associated with any search, it starts somewhere.  Can we bring the search process back into each of those tasks and make the search aware of it example is reading about a court decision, get news related</p>

<p>mobile search - multiple modes of access</p>

<p>CC search - demand from users to find content - licensed for reuse.</p>

<p>flickr - photosharing and community - they will bring in the DNA thinking about how users tag and share and expand on content.</p>

<p>what&#8217;s next - personal search, contextual seasrch, multimedia search, desktop search, local search, travel search, social media</p>

<p>next.yahoo.com</p>

<p>Mark -
did a walkthrough of bloglines</p>

<p>search/subscribe/share/publish</p>

<p>started bloglines to scratch his own itch, hundred sites a day to visit. information overload, blogcontent is the fastest growing area. 1.6 million articles every day.</p>

<p>Mark has 29 feeds in his own account (at least the one he demoed with)</p>

<p>search - keyword search , if you hit the save button you can subscribe to the query</p>

<p>the service is working to cull the information when you create feeds just for the stuff yo uwant to see (search for bloglines in posts instead of reading all posts to find the ones that mention bloglines)</p>

<p>what&#8217;s coming: search friends, filter articles</p>

<p>Udi-
Yello pages - launched in January - walk down the street, showed actually moving down the street</p>

<p>&#8220;it&#8217;s this place right next to that place on main street&#8221; - now you can find it, find the name, and then search for the info that you want.</p>

<p>showed the rental suv with the camera on top that took the pictures, gps, laptop. The driver drives and the system does everything else.</p>

<p>Udi spent two days doing it himself in arizona, it was a lot of fun</p>

<p>Jakob-
showed a table showing that since 1994 we have almost a 100% change in usage people used to use one word in 1994, and they use 2 words in 2004</p>

<p>probably a continuing growth curve, up to a point</p>

<p>how many people are successful:
42% for all searches
low experience 32% and high experience 50%
internal search on website 33% and external search 56%</p>

<p>search on websites is a miserable failure.  it&#8217;s a disgrace that we&#8217;ve allowed search on websites to be so bad, intranets are even worse.  it&#8217;s the most prevalent problem actually</p>

<p>showed a video of a recorded session of someone trying to search, but entered the search text into the wrong field.  and then going to search to try to find out what was up.  It was AOL search.  then she tries to type it into the location bar, and tries www.head.ache.com and it&#8217;s not found gets an error page and it gives a search option, she searches there and ends
up at msn search</p>

<p>looking at problems across all sites, 11% of them were related to search, biggest percentage of problem</p>

<hr />

<p>first question is to ask the other pannelists to reply to &#8220;search on websites is a miserable failure&#8221;</p>

<p>udi says that it&#8217;s not a failure, 50% is good.  It&#8217;s a hard problem. when you go to small sites, where the people do not have the resources of an outfit like AOL they just can&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p>mark - there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done, but it&#8217;s not just search.  It was basicproblems like how the browser is laid out.</p>

<p>Peter - the same thing happened to me with the IBM site when he was looking for a thinkpad.  And he went to this &#8216;experimental&#8217; site google, and typed in what he wanted and it was there.  Google was more powerfull than IBM.  That
means somethiing.</p>

<p>Ken - more and more people are using the general internet search with site restricts to do their search.  Before you do  it on your own, think about using one of the public engines to do it for you</p>

<p>How have searchers evolved besides more words?</p>

<p>Ken - demand for better search tools in vertical areas.  People used to be happy with general queries in the search engine, now they want the context to be appropriate to their task.  Yahoo is looking at the different categories that users seearch in and trying to figure out what goes in those different areas.  How do you make the user aware of it once you ahve it.  The results
page is a poor place to message to users about features and functionality.</p>

<p>Peter - second that, veritcal is very important. growth in international really stands out.  Majority is outside of US, ,not in english.</p>

<p>Mark - others from Ask told him - their query length is getting shorter.  people realize it&#8217;s not JUST natural language at Ask.  Tail has grown.  Majority of queries are completelly unique.  Expectations have grown, searches are successful, people search more, feedback loop.</p>

<p>Udi - the size of the search box actually influences the length of the search terms.  also thinks veritcal is imporatnt.  Opensearch, syndicated search for opening search and sharing it.  Anybody can take search results and put it on
A9.</p>

<p>Jakob - People use search cause they are selfish.  they don&#8217;t want to suffer theinterfaces that sites give them, that applies to both site search and general search engines.  If sites did use more standard and humane stuff, site map, richer navigation, that might not be so.  This has to be standardized navigation, for example site maps.  It has to be a standard widget, not a
one off trick</p>

<p>How do you give access to the different verticfals without turning into a portal?</p>

<p>Ken - the web search box IS the interface.  that&#8217;s what people want.  Don&#8217;t direct people to different areas, just figure out the conntext and provide them with it in place.  Rather than asking users to adapt ask the search engine to be smarter.  Is this a lcoal query?  Find the users intent.  Users have gotten confident.  That used to be the greatest problem, but it&#8217;s not the case any
more.  They expect good results.</p>

<p>Udi - Some queries work well and others dont.  &#8220;what&#8217;s the population of india&#8221; works even without any natural language.  &#8220;Waht&#8217;s the best TV to buy&#8221; does not. How do we balance ease of use and powerful tools?</p>

<p>Peter - we&#8217;ve failed in terms of letting the user to have a dialog.  search is a command line without a documented interface.  How do we put advice in place to help guide users to what they want.  We&#8217;re getting there but it&#8217;s nothing like walking into a library and getting help from the librarian.</p>

<p>Asked how many people have read advanced help, show of hands - lots had, atypical crowd</p>

<p>Are folksonomy/tagging a fundamentally different set of data than what is there?</p>

<p>Udi - it&#8217;s all just metadata, it&#8217;s our job to deal with it.  it&#8217;s not any different, the hope is that people will provide much data</p>

<p>Ken - it&#8217;s remarkable in that it&#8217;s just like what we already deal with.  Right now tagging is done by web authors, and now tagging we can collect from a larger group of people.  The more metadata the better.  The more we can get from users and not authors it should make it better info.</p>

<p>Jakob - we won&#8217;t get much mroe info from users. with taggintg hte barrier is lower, but it&#8217;s still  there.  we have to get passive data out of people, eyeball time and metrics from the desktop</p>

<p>Ken - if they find value they&#8217;ll do it.</p>

<p>jakob - okay, but it has to be more inline with the work they do already, like spam marking in collaborative filters</p>

<p>Udi - mapr maps flickr to a map view.  lots of images in Maine, cause people tag with &#8220;me&#8221; (as in myself), but mapr thinks it&#8217;s a location.</p>

<hr />

<p>there are questions from the audience now.  And these are just the cool bits</p>

<p>Udi - a9 keeps context.  If you do a search twice, a few months apart.  the second time you get a message that says &#8220;these results are new, you haven&#8217;t seen them before&#8221;, and &#8220;these are the items you clicked on last time you did it&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone asked when people don&#8217;t use search, for what kinds of queries does a user typically not revert to the search interface?  This answer from Jakob is great:</p>

<p>Jakob - people do not search when they&#8217;re loyal customers of someone.  If you&#8217;re a loyal customer of Amazon you don&#8217;t search for books on Google, you search on Amazon.</p>

<p>Someone asked if the search wars were going to be defined in terms of branding and not tech.  All seemed to think it was still a tech race.  In that regard the industry is still evolving.  People have thought the search battle was over previously, but that wasn&#8217;t correct.  It&#8217;s not correct now, there is a lot more evolution to go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note, I need to get back to work after having a late lunch but didn&#8217;t want to let this slip through the cracks. <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101538&amp;pos=1_-1&amp;ref=6630022">Patently Absurd: How New Wireless Technologies Get Strangled By Patents</a> is worth a read.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><p>The real problem, though, is that this isn&#8217;t at all how the patent system was supposed to work. The companies that really are working on MIMO technology for use in things like next generation Wi-Fi didn&#8217;t get the idea for MIMO from a random Speedus patent, but from recognizing that it was the most obvious way to speed up wireless transmissions. In other words, the core claim of a patent, it being &#8220;non-obvious&#8221; doesn&#8217;t apply. No one has &#8220;stolen&#8221; the ideas in the patent in question. It&#8217;s just that lots of people came up with similar ideas at the same time through the natural evolution of the technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>Almost everyone I talk to about patents within the software arena thinks that the system is hopelessly broken, yet they still go out and get their own patents because they&#8217;re useful as a &#8220;blocking technique&#8221;.  Meaning if you have your own patent when someone comes to sue you for infringing on their patent, you&#8217;re on better footing because of that patent you have. But those who go out to get blocking patents sometimes end up in a situation where it seems like they could recover their legal fees and maybe make some money by exercising their patents. It&#8217;s a tempting prospect once you have the patent in hand already. It forms a nice little closed loop feedback cycle where more patents lead to more patents, and the way to avoid the threat of patents is to get patents yourself. Not exactly the way I would like for things to be, but at least there&#8217;s no decisions to make.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday there was a <a href="http://www.osbc2004.com/live/13/events/13SFO05A/conference/tracksessions/Enterprise+Strategy/QMONYA04N6ZW">session during the Open Source Business Conference titled Meet the Community</a>. The lineup of speakers was stellar. Ross Mayfield <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/04/meet_the_commun.html">posted a transcript</a> and Niall Kennedy <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/04/open_source_com.html">posted some commentary</a>. I think my favorite comment was from Brian Behlendorf, who said that he never really considered companies special entities in the context of the projects he works on. That&#8217;s really a great comment, as long as you remember to say it without a derisive sneer. As a company interfacing with an open source project you probably don&#8217;t get much special consideration from the developers already working on the project unless your goals line up with their own. However, you do have a couple of options available that don&#8217;t always exist for individuals. Here&#8217;s a basic rundown of the options you have as a company looking to use an open source project but needing features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contribution - For most circumstances this is the most desirable. It&#8217;s important to realize that this is only going to work if the feature you need is useful to people outside of your organization. If what you&#8217;re interested in is adding a feature to Bugzilla to get it to control a 3270 terminal to double enter bugs in your 20 year old custom developed mainframe system, you&#8217;re probably not working on something that others would find use in. If others aren&#8217;t going to be able to use your feature, it&#8217;s probably not going to make it into the main source tree, and contribution probably isn&#8217;t an option for you. One of the benefits of contribution is that once you release your code into the wild others will probably maintain it and improve it. It decreases the cost for everyone when contributions have multiple users because that means multiple possible maintainers. However, sometimes it happens that someone contributes code and then walks away. No one is using the code but no one really knows that.  It increases the maintenance cost for everyone and benefits no one. Because of this danger successful open source projects have developed something like an immune system to combat single user features. Don&#8217;t be surprized if you find there&#8217;s a lot of friction in trying to get your feature accepted.</li>
</ul>


<p>So assuming you don&#8217;t have a single user feature, how do you go about getting this done? You get one of your developers, or hire a consultant, or find someone from among the ranks of existing developers for the project and tell/pay them to develop the feature for you. This is probably just the tip of the iceberg though. Now you need to get it into the main code base. There are a bunch of little things you can do to make sure that the code is acceptable. Make sure it complies with the standards used in the rest of the project, make sure you provide some info about what the feature is and communicate with the existing developers about what you&#8217;re trying to do and why. But the most important is to release the feature so that others can try it out. If you have a feature and you&#8217;re trying to get it into a project, and you&#8217;re the only one saying the feature is necessary, it&#8217;s easy to ignore you. If you release the feature, put it up online, and a dozen other users snap it up and start clamouring about how their world is now a better and brighter place, that&#8217;s an extremely compelling argument. Your feature might still not get accepted, in which case you&#8217;ll have to look at parallel development below.  Or you might end up parallel for a while and then eventually end up back in contribution. Once the code is accepted you probably still want to dedicate some resources to making sure that your feature doesn&#8217;t end up being a sore spot in the code and getting dropped. This is pretty hard to monitor unless you have someone on staff to do it. If you got a consultant to do the original development you probably want to pay them a retainer for a while to make sure the feature is updated along with the main codebase, and to have them available for other needs you might have related to use of the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallel Development - Everyone seems to overlook this option, or discount it as entirely too expensive. Maybe the software practice all over is even worse than I expected it to be, but this kind of thing is done in embedded systems all the time. I just don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t work for infrastructure projects as well (although I can see somewhat for core changes to desktop applications, which tend to have a form that&#8217;s much harder to abstract changes for). The idea here is that you develop whatever it is that you need, and maybe release it maybe not, but you don&#8217;t push it back into the core. Now when the next version of the project comes out you move your changes so that they work with that next version.  And you keep doing that. There are lots of techniques available to make this process easier. Most revision control systems have features specifically meant to deal with taking original sources from some external provider and reapplying local changes to generate a specialized version. If the project is relatively well designed and your changes are well architected it can be pretty trivial to track the original project indefinitely like this. In addition to being a valid technique even when your feature isn&#8217;t of use to the general populace this is also a good technique if you consider your feature to be a competitive advantage. If your &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; that allows you to be twice as responsive to customer requests as your competitors constitutes a set of tweeks to your CRM system you don&#8217;t have to release that code if you&#8217;re only using your code at your own company (remember, the GPL requires you to ship source if you ship other GPL code with change applied). If if you never ship you never have to disclose your source. The downside is that you have to bear the whole cost of maintenance yourself. And of course, you don&#8217;t benefit from the input of a larger community with respect to your technique for solving the problem you&#8217;ve gone after.</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s also another option for parallel versions, which is stopping forward development and selectively picking the changes you want. This is an option for the times when development of the main project proceeds in a way that you find disagreeable for some reason (the main branch has broken compatability with formats you use, the license has changed and now includes disagreeable clauses, etc). This is actually the ultimate form of gaurantee in terms of making sure that you&#8217;ll be able to keep running with the project you choose. In commercial software sometimes the source code will be held in escrow and a license will include a clause that says if the provider goes out of business or can no longer provide support for the package all current customers get a copy of the code so that they&#8217;re gauranteed they can keep running. Well open source projects come with that by default. And not only can you decide to grab the code and go your own way if the project fails, but you can do it if you don&#8217;t like the direction the project has taken, if they&#8217;re not giving you the features you need, or if you just plain old feel like it. I actually see less risk and more gaurantee of continuity with open source than with most commercial projects. Yet most folks cringe and wrinke their noses when I talk about this. If they ever took a look at how much they throw away on software installs and consulting and licenses and compare that to getting a few decent open source hackers and switching to open source, I think the cost of open source over the long term is less and the risk is lower.</p>

<ul>
<li>Forking - This is the most drastic option, and the most likely to land you in hot water if you do it when you shouldn&#8217;t. Forking should only be considered in extreme situations. What happens in a fork is that at least two version of the code are progressing on their own. The difference between parallel development and forking is that both groups put out the full set of code, and in general stop exchanging patches. There are all sorts of shades of grey in here, situations where both projects keep going but are feeding each other changes in preparation for a planned merge down the line, situations where the forked version is really just an enhanced distribution. Some of those situations can seem positive, but usually they end up hurting the project.  Even a fork for justified purposes can be so damaging to the project overall that it shouldn&#8217;t be done. You might be justified in forking a project if you have a feature that ends up getting used by more than half the users of the project, but which the core developers refuse to accept into the main codebase. But even if that happens you need to take into  account the cost of the forking operation itself. A fork confuses users, it generally creates a whole bunch of bad press and negative feelings, in dividing the developer and user base you have less resources for the project, you generally have to replicate all the other project support mechanisms like code repository and bug tracking system, it&#8217;s just ugly. So think twice before you do something like this. I&#8217;m not even gonna go into the details any more, if you&#8217;re thinking about forking you should already know these things.</li>
</ul>


<p>So there it is, not quite in a nutshell. That really provides a whole bunch of freedom. The situations take on a few more aspects once you talk about redistributing what you do. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been through a bunch of times with the embedded systems work, so maybe I&#8217;ll write up that set of paths later on. I was actually also going to write up a comparison of the effects of the open source movement unbundling code from individual projects to the effects of the recombinant DNA experiments that arose with sex during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian Explosion</a>, but that&#8217;ll have to wait till another time. Perhaps the open source folks are being too kind when they refer to the vendors of proprietary software as dinosaurs. Perhaps we should be calling them single cell organisms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Elle and I got home from New Orleans our phone wasn&#8217;t working and our DSL connection was bouncing up and down. They got that fixed up during the day, thanks to some poking and prodding from Elle.  But this evening when I went to send email I kept getting errors. Fire up netcat, no response at all from the mail server on port 25.  My first reaction is that it must be either network problems or <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> bouncing servers (they seem to like to do that).  A while later and I&#8217;m still getting errors though. So just for the hell of it I connect up over GPRS and try to send the message like that. Works no problem. Interesting. Sure enough there are random reports scattered all over the place about SBC turning on outbound port filtering for SMTP. Motherfuckers!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> says she&#8217;s been having trouble with SMTP outbound for a while, and that she saw the suggestion to switch to port 587 somewhere. Sure enough, that works. Turns out port 587 is reserved for the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt">message submission protocol</a>. A protocol that seems to exist entirely as existing description of what should be done with SMTP when using it to insert messages into a system from a client program. I know I sent email from home right before we left for New Orleans, so this must be some on again off again kind of SBC experiment. I&#8217;m pretty pissed about it though. Spam sucks, sure. But so do unnotified infrastructure changes. And now my ISP has decided to inconvenience me for their own benefit. Speaking as a customer I can say that this definitely does not increase my satisfaction. I know all the reasons an ISP would block outbound SMTP (they apparently have a spammer problem and must be getting dropped into blocking lists, so they want to route everyone through their own authenticated relay). I just don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re valid. It&#8217;s the cheapest, easiest, bluntest way they could deal with the issue. And this is just them being cheap because they can get away with it, because most people don&#8217;t understand the underlying issues and what the potential solutions are. It&#8217;s not like this is a new issue, Lessig wrote about it a long time ago in <a href="http://www.lessig.org/content/standard/0,1902,3006,00.html">The Spam Wars</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Certainly, spam is an issue. But the real problem is that vigilantes and network service providers are deciding fundamental policy questions about how the Net will work - each group from its own perspective.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is policy-making by the &#8220;invisible hand.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that policy is not being made, but that those making the policy are unaccountable. The self-righteous spam police may or may not be right about the solution to spam; that&#8217;s not the point&#8230;.</p>

<p>I pay my ISP to shift packets around, that&#8217;s all I want it to do.  I apply spam filters on my own, because I know that applying port filtering is about as effective in stopping spam as virgin sacrifice (so folks as SBC, sorry to spoil your fun, but that won&#8217;t work either). I do not pay them to tell me to what sites and services I&#8217;m allowed to connect. But they&#8217;ve decided to take it upon themselves to fill that role. From where I&#8217;m standing, they&#8217;ve just decided to partially stop servicing my needs. And with no upside. Don&#8217;t forget, I don&#8217;t give a shit if their servers end up blacklisted. This discussion started with me wanting to connect to an external server, which is itself not blacklisted. I do not want them doing this for me, but as far as I know I have no choice. When customer support starts answering their phones again maybe I&#8217;ll try to find out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thad White speaking at <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/04/april-mobile-monday-tonight.html">the April MoMo</a>.</p>

<p>Director, Product Management, Yahoo! Mobile</p>

<p>Yahoo things about three groups - communications, information, entertainment.</p>

<p>communication - IM, mail, photos</p>

<p>information - search, wap for news, sports, weather, and alerts</p>

<p>entertainment - downloadable brew games, ringtones from launch</p>

<p>Distribution is a big issue, yahoo has a great relationship with carriers.</p>

<p>Opportunity - Yahoo heard that users wanted to take their information with them on mobile phones. So they launced send to phone.</p>

<p>Simple form sends basic info like phone number and cross street info.  If you go past the limits of SMS (160 chars), for instance driving directions, it sends a text message with a link to a WAP page.</p>

<p>Challenges -</p>

<p>reach vs. quality of user interface (they wanted to maximize reach so they went with SMS and WAP).</p>

<p>Abuse protection, but didn&#8217;t want there to be a high barrier to use. So they limited on the send and receive side.  Number of messages that can to to a single device.</p>

<p>Price sensitivity. Can&#8217;t send a whole lot of messages.</p>

<p>Verizon WAP integration. Verizon doesn&#8217;t extract the URL.</p>

<p>Results -</p>

<p>Significant adoption among PC audience. A direct call to action resulted in a 10x increase in click through.</p>

<p>Great user feedback and press.</p>

<p>Interest internally among more Yahoo properties to launch &#8220;send to phone&#8221;</p>

<p>Next steps -</p>

<p>Extend to more properties.</p>

<p>Extend to MMS and other delivery mechanisms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fabrizio speaking at <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/04/april-mobile-monday-tonight.html">the April MoMo</a>.</p>

<p>Fabrizio is from <a href="http://sync4j.funambol.com/main.jsp?main=theproject">Funambol</a>, the company behind an open source SyncML project with more than 10,000 downloads to date.</p>

<p>SyncML does data management (contacts, appointments) and device management (&#8220;can you fix my device&#8221; and the carrier can fix the device remotely).</p>

<p>They take data from different sources and put it out over SyncML (ERP, CRM, Email servers).  Most devices already have a SyncML client installed (calendar, contacts, ie).</p>

<p>They also have clients for pocketpc, palm is coming.</p>

<p>They also have multiple APIs into the platform to put information from a datasource into a device, and then the device can work offline.</p>

<p>Lots of downloads, growing quickly, lots of developers, great ramp.</p>

<p>Today they are launching is a Sync4j portal. Free, come and use it. Contacts, calendar, plugin for outlook that puts data online, palm can upload, pocket pc can upload. Currently in alpha.</p>

<p>They need to get data from different sources (gmail calendar, yahoo address book), calendar with mozilla.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re putting up a database with all the devices and the SyncML support and how to use it.</p>

<p>If you need to develop a wireless app that needs data try Sync4J.  If you get it to work give Funambol some feedback. Want to add audio and pictures. info at funambol.com And if you want to work for a cool mobile open source company, mail him as well. Looking for marketing, presales engineers, that type of thing.</p>
