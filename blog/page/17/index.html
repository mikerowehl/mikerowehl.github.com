  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are notes from the &#8221;<a href="http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20050412b/">Recent Innovations in Search and Other Ways of Finding Information</a>&#8221; panel at BayCHI. It was an absolutely fantastic panel! Very well done, the panelists were great all around (although personally I think I liked the contributions from <a href="http://manber.com/">Udi</a> the most). I&#8217;ll have to come back at some points and clean up these notes, they&#8217;re in kinda rough shape.</p>

<p>Panelists:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Peter Norvig</p></li>
<li><p>Mark Fletcher</p></li>
<li><p>Udi Manber</p></li>
<li><p>Ken Norton</p></li>
<li><p>Jakob Nielsen</p></li>
</ul>


<p>5 minute show and tell by each panelist</p>

<p>Peter -
talked about question and answer &#8220;what is population of japan&#8221; was the example</p>

<p>extracted facts from the web</p>

<p>facts are represented many times, accuracy is a problem</p>

<p>then search by sms - people are using more andmore mobile</p>

<p>maps on the cell phone</p>

<p>then google maps overall - plus ssatelite photos</p>

<p>niagra falls, white horse</p>

<p>predictive seach - google suggest</p>

<p>talked about AJAX in particular - google has been pushing it Jesse Garrett</p>

<p>Google desktop search - example combining both desktop and the web</p>

<p>Ken -
Enable people to find, use, share and expand all human knowledge</p>

<p>most people addressing only the find part, yahoo wants to do all</p>

<p>remixing and remaking</p>

<p>desktop/creative commons, YDN, big list of things they did</p>

<p>MyYahooSearch - in beta, released soon
gives users more control, allows to save and share, like bookmarking but hopefully a step beyond.</p>

<p>video search - huge ammount of content out there, huge demand, that&#8217;s new</p>

<p>mediarss - allows people to submit their content back after remixing</p>

<p>desktop search</p>

<p>Y!Q - bringing search to the point of inspiration - there is context associated with any search, it starts somewhere.  Can we bring the search process back into each of those tasks and make the search aware of it example is reading about a court decision, get news related</p>

<p>mobile search - multiple modes of access</p>

<p>CC search - demand from users to find content - licensed for reuse.</p>

<p>flickr - photosharing and community - they will bring in the DNA thinking about how users tag and share and expand on content.</p>

<p>what&#8217;s next - personal search, contextual seasrch, multimedia search, desktop search, local search, travel search, social media</p>

<p>next.yahoo.com</p>

<p>Mark -
did a walkthrough of bloglines</p>

<p>search/subscribe/share/publish</p>

<p>started bloglines to scratch his own itch, hundred sites a day to visit. information overload, blogcontent is the fastest growing area. 1.6 million articles every day.</p>

<p>Mark has 29 feeds in his own account (at least the one he demoed with)</p>

<p>search - keyword search , if you hit the save button you can subscribe to the query</p>

<p>the service is working to cull the information when you create feeds just for the stuff yo uwant to see (search for bloglines in posts instead of reading all posts to find the ones that mention bloglines)</p>

<p>what&#8217;s coming: search friends, filter articles</p>

<p>Udi-
Yello pages - launched in January - walk down the street, showed actually moving down the street</p>

<p>&#8220;it&#8217;s this place right next to that place on main street&#8221; - now you can find it, find the name, and then search for the info that you want.</p>

<p>showed the rental suv with the camera on top that took the pictures, gps, laptop. The driver drives and the system does everything else.</p>

<p>Udi spent two days doing it himself in arizona, it was a lot of fun</p>

<p>Jakob-
showed a table showing that since 1994 we have almost a 100% change in usage people used to use one word in 1994, and they use 2 words in 2004</p>

<p>probably a continuing growth curve, up to a point</p>

<p>how many people are successful:
42% for all searches
low experience 32% and high experience 50%
internal search on website 33% and external search 56%</p>

<p>search on websites is a miserable failure.  it&#8217;s a disgrace that we&#8217;ve allowed search on websites to be so bad, intranets are even worse.  it&#8217;s the most prevalent problem actually</p>

<p>showed a video of a recorded session of someone trying to search, but entered the search text into the wrong field.  and then going to search to try to find out what was up.  It was AOL search.  then she tries to type it into the location bar, and tries www.head.ache.com and it&#8217;s not found gets an error page and it gives a search option, she searches there and ends
up at msn search</p>

<p>looking at problems across all sites, 11% of them were related to search, biggest percentage of problem</p>

<hr />

<p>first question is to ask the other pannelists to reply to &#8220;search on websites is a miserable failure&#8221;</p>

<p>udi says that it&#8217;s not a failure, 50% is good.  It&#8217;s a hard problem. when you go to small sites, where the people do not have the resources of an outfit like AOL they just can&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p>mark - there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done, but it&#8217;s not just search.  It was basicproblems like how the browser is laid out.</p>

<p>Peter - the same thing happened to me with the IBM site when he was looking for a thinkpad.  And he went to this &#8216;experimental&#8217; site google, and typed in what he wanted and it was there.  Google was more powerfull than IBM.  That
means somethiing.</p>

<p>Ken - more and more people are using the general internet search with site restricts to do their search.  Before you do  it on your own, think about using one of the public engines to do it for you</p>

<p>How have searchers evolved besides more words?</p>

<p>Ken - demand for better search tools in vertical areas.  People used to be happy with general queries in the search engine, now they want the context to be appropriate to their task.  Yahoo is looking at the different categories that users seearch in and trying to figure out what goes in those different areas.  How do you make the user aware of it once you ahve it.  The results
page is a poor place to message to users about features and functionality.</p>

<p>Peter - second that, veritcal is very important. growth in international really stands out.  Majority is outside of US, ,not in english.</p>

<p>Mark - others from Ask told him - their query length is getting shorter.  people realize it&#8217;s not JUST natural language at Ask.  Tail has grown.  Majority of queries are completelly unique.  Expectations have grown, searches are successful, people search more, feedback loop.</p>

<p>Udi - the size of the search box actually influences the length of the search terms.  also thinks veritcal is imporatnt.  Opensearch, syndicated search for opening search and sharing it.  Anybody can take search results and put it on
A9.</p>

<p>Jakob - People use search cause they are selfish.  they don&#8217;t want to suffer theinterfaces that sites give them, that applies to both site search and general search engines.  If sites did use more standard and humane stuff, site map, richer navigation, that might not be so.  This has to be standardized navigation, for example site maps.  It has to be a standard widget, not a
one off trick</p>

<p>How do you give access to the different verticfals without turning into a portal?</p>

<p>Ken - the web search box IS the interface.  that&#8217;s what people want.  Don&#8217;t direct people to different areas, just figure out the conntext and provide them with it in place.  Rather than asking users to adapt ask the search engine to be smarter.  Is this a lcoal query?  Find the users intent.  Users have gotten confident.  That used to be the greatest problem, but it&#8217;s not the case any
more.  They expect good results.</p>

<p>Udi - Some queries work well and others dont.  &#8220;what&#8217;s the population of india&#8221; works even without any natural language.  &#8220;Waht&#8217;s the best TV to buy&#8221; does not. How do we balance ease of use and powerful tools?</p>

<p>Peter - we&#8217;ve failed in terms of letting the user to have a dialog.  search is a command line without a documented interface.  How do we put advice in place to help guide users to what they want.  We&#8217;re getting there but it&#8217;s nothing like walking into a library and getting help from the librarian.</p>

<p>Asked how many people have read advanced help, show of hands - lots had, atypical crowd</p>

<p>Are folksonomy/tagging a fundamentally different set of data than what is there?</p>

<p>Udi - it&#8217;s all just metadata, it&#8217;s our job to deal with it.  it&#8217;s not any different, the hope is that people will provide much data</p>

<p>Ken - it&#8217;s remarkable in that it&#8217;s just like what we already deal with.  Right now tagging is done by web authors, and now tagging we can collect from a larger group of people.  The more metadata the better.  The more we can get from users and not authors it should make it better info.</p>

<p>Jakob - we won&#8217;t get much mroe info from users. with taggintg hte barrier is lower, but it&#8217;s still  there.  we have to get passive data out of people, eyeball time and metrics from the desktop</p>

<p>Ken - if they find value they&#8217;ll do it.</p>

<p>jakob - okay, but it has to be more inline with the work they do already, like spam marking in collaborative filters</p>

<p>Udi - mapr maps flickr to a map view.  lots of images in Maine, cause people tag with &#8220;me&#8221; (as in myself), but mapr thinks it&#8217;s a location.</p>

<hr />

<p>there are questions from the audience now.  And these are just the cool bits</p>

<p>Udi - a9 keeps context.  If you do a search twice, a few months apart.  the second time you get a message that says &#8220;these results are new, you haven&#8217;t seen them before&#8221;, and &#8220;these are the items you clicked on last time you did it&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone asked when people don&#8217;t use search, for what kinds of queries does a user typically not revert to the search interface?  This answer from Jakob is great:</p>

<p>Jakob - people do not search when they&#8217;re loyal customers of someone.  If you&#8217;re a loyal customer of Amazon you don&#8217;t search for books on Google, you search on Amazon.</p>

<p>Someone asked if the search wars were going to be defined in terms of branding and not tech.  All seemed to think it was still a tech race.  In that regard the industry is still evolving.  People have thought the search battle was over previously, but that wasn&#8217;t correct.  It&#8217;s not correct now, there is a lot more evolution to go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note, I need to get back to work after having a late lunch but didn&#8217;t want to let this slip through the cracks. <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101538&amp;pos=1_-1&amp;ref=6630022">Patently Absurd: How New Wireless Technologies Get Strangled By Patents</a> is worth a read.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><p>The real problem, though, is that this isn&#8217;t at all how the patent system was supposed to work. The companies that really are working on MIMO technology for use in things like next generation Wi-Fi didn&#8217;t get the idea for MIMO from a random Speedus patent, but from recognizing that it was the most obvious way to speed up wireless transmissions. In other words, the core claim of a patent, it being &#8220;non-obvious&#8221; doesn&#8217;t apply. No one has &#8220;stolen&#8221; the ideas in the patent in question. It&#8217;s just that lots of people came up with similar ideas at the same time through the natural evolution of the technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>Almost everyone I talk to about patents within the software arena thinks that the system is hopelessly broken, yet they still go out and get their own patents because they&#8217;re useful as a &#8220;blocking technique&#8221;.  Meaning if you have your own patent when someone comes to sue you for infringing on their patent, you&#8217;re on better footing because of that patent you have. But those who go out to get blocking patents sometimes end up in a situation where it seems like they could recover their legal fees and maybe make some money by exercising their patents. It&#8217;s a tempting prospect once you have the patent in hand already. It forms a nice little closed loop feedback cycle where more patents lead to more patents, and the way to avoid the threat of patents is to get patents yourself. Not exactly the way I would like for things to be, but at least there&#8217;s no decisions to make.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday there was a <a href="http://www.osbc2004.com/live/13/events/13SFO05A/conference/tracksessions/Enterprise+Strategy/QMONYA04N6ZW">session during the Open Source Business Conference titled Meet the Community</a>. The lineup of speakers was stellar. Ross Mayfield <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/04/meet_the_commun.html">posted a transcript</a> and Niall Kennedy <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/04/open_source_com.html">posted some commentary</a>. I think my favorite comment was from Brian Behlendorf, who said that he never really considered companies special entities in the context of the projects he works on. That&#8217;s really a great comment, as long as you remember to say it without a derisive sneer. As a company interfacing with an open source project you probably don&#8217;t get much special consideration from the developers already working on the project unless your goals line up with their own. However, you do have a couple of options available that don&#8217;t always exist for individuals. Here&#8217;s a basic rundown of the options you have as a company looking to use an open source project but needing features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contribution - For most circumstances this is the most desirable. It&#8217;s important to realize that this is only going to work if the feature you need is useful to people outside of your organization. If what you&#8217;re interested in is adding a feature to Bugzilla to get it to control a 3270 terminal to double enter bugs in your 20 year old custom developed mainframe system, you&#8217;re probably not working on something that others would find use in. If others aren&#8217;t going to be able to use your feature, it&#8217;s probably not going to make it into the main source tree, and contribution probably isn&#8217;t an option for you. One of the benefits of contribution is that once you release your code into the wild others will probably maintain it and improve it. It decreases the cost for everyone when contributions have multiple users because that means multiple possible maintainers. However, sometimes it happens that someone contributes code and then walks away. No one is using the code but no one really knows that.  It increases the maintenance cost for everyone and benefits no one. Because of this danger successful open source projects have developed something like an immune system to combat single user features. Don&#8217;t be surprized if you find there&#8217;s a lot of friction in trying to get your feature accepted.</li>
</ul>


<p>So assuming you don&#8217;t have a single user feature, how do you go about getting this done? You get one of your developers, or hire a consultant, or find someone from among the ranks of existing developers for the project and tell/pay them to develop the feature for you. This is probably just the tip of the iceberg though. Now you need to get it into the main code base. There are a bunch of little things you can do to make sure that the code is acceptable. Make sure it complies with the standards used in the rest of the project, make sure you provide some info about what the feature is and communicate with the existing developers about what you&#8217;re trying to do and why. But the most important is to release the feature so that others can try it out. If you have a feature and you&#8217;re trying to get it into a project, and you&#8217;re the only one saying the feature is necessary, it&#8217;s easy to ignore you. If you release the feature, put it up online, and a dozen other users snap it up and start clamouring about how their world is now a better and brighter place, that&#8217;s an extremely compelling argument. Your feature might still not get accepted, in which case you&#8217;ll have to look at parallel development below.  Or you might end up parallel for a while and then eventually end up back in contribution. Once the code is accepted you probably still want to dedicate some resources to making sure that your feature doesn&#8217;t end up being a sore spot in the code and getting dropped. This is pretty hard to monitor unless you have someone on staff to do it. If you got a consultant to do the original development you probably want to pay them a retainer for a while to make sure the feature is updated along with the main codebase, and to have them available for other needs you might have related to use of the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallel Development - Everyone seems to overlook this option, or discount it as entirely too expensive. Maybe the software practice all over is even worse than I expected it to be, but this kind of thing is done in embedded systems all the time. I just don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t work for infrastructure projects as well (although I can see somewhat for core changes to desktop applications, which tend to have a form that&#8217;s much harder to abstract changes for). The idea here is that you develop whatever it is that you need, and maybe release it maybe not, but you don&#8217;t push it back into the core. Now when the next version of the project comes out you move your changes so that they work with that next version.  And you keep doing that. There are lots of techniques available to make this process easier. Most revision control systems have features specifically meant to deal with taking original sources from some external provider and reapplying local changes to generate a specialized version. If the project is relatively well designed and your changes are well architected it can be pretty trivial to track the original project indefinitely like this. In addition to being a valid technique even when your feature isn&#8217;t of use to the general populace this is also a good technique if you consider your feature to be a competitive advantage. If your &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; that allows you to be twice as responsive to customer requests as your competitors constitutes a set of tweeks to your CRM system you don&#8217;t have to release that code if you&#8217;re only using your code at your own company (remember, the GPL requires you to ship source if you ship other GPL code with change applied). If if you never ship you never have to disclose your source. The downside is that you have to bear the whole cost of maintenance yourself. And of course, you don&#8217;t benefit from the input of a larger community with respect to your technique for solving the problem you&#8217;ve gone after.</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s also another option for parallel versions, which is stopping forward development and selectively picking the changes you want. This is an option for the times when development of the main project proceeds in a way that you find disagreeable for some reason (the main branch has broken compatability with formats you use, the license has changed and now includes disagreeable clauses, etc). This is actually the ultimate form of gaurantee in terms of making sure that you&#8217;ll be able to keep running with the project you choose. In commercial software sometimes the source code will be held in escrow and a license will include a clause that says if the provider goes out of business or can no longer provide support for the package all current customers get a copy of the code so that they&#8217;re gauranteed they can keep running. Well open source projects come with that by default. And not only can you decide to grab the code and go your own way if the project fails, but you can do it if you don&#8217;t like the direction the project has taken, if they&#8217;re not giving you the features you need, or if you just plain old feel like it. I actually see less risk and more gaurantee of continuity with open source than with most commercial projects. Yet most folks cringe and wrinke their noses when I talk about this. If they ever took a look at how much they throw away on software installs and consulting and licenses and compare that to getting a few decent open source hackers and switching to open source, I think the cost of open source over the long term is less and the risk is lower.</p>

<ul>
<li>Forking - This is the most drastic option, and the most likely to land you in hot water if you do it when you shouldn&#8217;t. Forking should only be considered in extreme situations. What happens in a fork is that at least two version of the code are progressing on their own. The difference between parallel development and forking is that both groups put out the full set of code, and in general stop exchanging patches. There are all sorts of shades of grey in here, situations where both projects keep going but are feeding each other changes in preparation for a planned merge down the line, situations where the forked version is really just an enhanced distribution. Some of those situations can seem positive, but usually they end up hurting the project.  Even a fork for justified purposes can be so damaging to the project overall that it shouldn&#8217;t be done. You might be justified in forking a project if you have a feature that ends up getting used by more than half the users of the project, but which the core developers refuse to accept into the main codebase. But even if that happens you need to take into  account the cost of the forking operation itself. A fork confuses users, it generally creates a whole bunch of bad press and negative feelings, in dividing the developer and user base you have less resources for the project, you generally have to replicate all the other project support mechanisms like code repository and bug tracking system, it&#8217;s just ugly. So think twice before you do something like this. I&#8217;m not even gonna go into the details any more, if you&#8217;re thinking about forking you should already know these things.</li>
</ul>


<p>So there it is, not quite in a nutshell. That really provides a whole bunch of freedom. The situations take on a few more aspects once you talk about redistributing what you do. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been through a bunch of times with the embedded systems work, so maybe I&#8217;ll write up that set of paths later on. I was actually also going to write up a comparison of the effects of the open source movement unbundling code from individual projects to the effects of the recombinant DNA experiments that arose with sex during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian Explosion</a>, but that&#8217;ll have to wait till another time. Perhaps the open source folks are being too kind when they refer to the vendors of proprietary software as dinosaurs. Perhaps we should be calling them single cell organisms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Elle and I got home from New Orleans our phone wasn&#8217;t working and our DSL connection was bouncing up and down. They got that fixed up during the day, thanks to some poking and prodding from Elle.  But this evening when I went to send email I kept getting errors. Fire up netcat, no response at all from the mail server on port 25.  My first reaction is that it must be either network problems or <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> bouncing servers (they seem to like to do that).  A while later and I&#8217;m still getting errors though. So just for the hell of it I connect up over GPRS and try to send the message like that. Works no problem. Interesting. Sure enough there are random reports scattered all over the place about SBC turning on outbound port filtering for SMTP. Motherfuckers!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> says she&#8217;s been having trouble with SMTP outbound for a while, and that she saw the suggestion to switch to port 587 somewhere. Sure enough, that works. Turns out port 587 is reserved for the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt">message submission protocol</a>. A protocol that seems to exist entirely as existing description of what should be done with SMTP when using it to insert messages into a system from a client program. I know I sent email from home right before we left for New Orleans, so this must be some on again off again kind of SBC experiment. I&#8217;m pretty pissed about it though. Spam sucks, sure. But so do unnotified infrastructure changes. And now my ISP has decided to inconvenience me for their own benefit. Speaking as a customer I can say that this definitely does not increase my satisfaction. I know all the reasons an ISP would block outbound SMTP (they apparently have a spammer problem and must be getting dropped into blocking lists, so they want to route everyone through their own authenticated relay). I just don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re valid. It&#8217;s the cheapest, easiest, bluntest way they could deal with the issue. And this is just them being cheap because they can get away with it, because most people don&#8217;t understand the underlying issues and what the potential solutions are. It&#8217;s not like this is a new issue, Lessig wrote about it a long time ago in <a href="http://www.lessig.org/content/standard/0,1902,3006,00.html">The Spam Wars</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Certainly, spam is an issue. But the real problem is that vigilantes and network service providers are deciding fundamental policy questions about how the Net will work - each group from its own perspective.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is policy-making by the &#8220;invisible hand.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that policy is not being made, but that those making the policy are unaccountable. The self-righteous spam police may or may not be right about the solution to spam; that&#8217;s not the point&#8230;.</p>

<p>I pay my ISP to shift packets around, that&#8217;s all I want it to do.  I apply spam filters on my own, because I know that applying port filtering is about as effective in stopping spam as virgin sacrifice (so folks as SBC, sorry to spoil your fun, but that won&#8217;t work either). I do not pay them to tell me to what sites and services I&#8217;m allowed to connect. But they&#8217;ve decided to take it upon themselves to fill that role. From where I&#8217;m standing, they&#8217;ve just decided to partially stop servicing my needs. And with no upside. Don&#8217;t forget, I don&#8217;t give a shit if their servers end up blacklisted. This discussion started with me wanting to connect to an external server, which is itself not blacklisted. I do not want them doing this for me, but as far as I know I have no choice. When customer support starts answering their phones again maybe I&#8217;ll try to find out.</p>

<p>Director, Product Management, Yahoo! Mobile</p>

<p>Yahoo things about three groups - communications, information, entertainment.</p>

<p>communication - IM, mail, photos</p>

<p>information - search, wap for news, sports, weather, and alerts</p>

<p>entertainment - downloadable brew games, ringtones from launch</p>

<p>Distribution is a big issue, yahoo has a great relationship with carriers.</p>

<p>Opportunity - Yahoo heard that users wanted to take their information with them on mobile phones. So they launced send to phone.</p>

<p>Simple form sends basic info like phone number and cross street info.  If you go past the limits of SMS (160 chars), for instance driving directions, it sends a text message with a link to a WAP page.</p>

<p>Challenges -</p>

<p>reach vs. quality of user interface (they wanted to maximize reach so they went with SMS and WAP).</p>

<p>Abuse protection, but didn&#8217;t want there to be a high barrier to use. So they limited on the send and receive side.  Number of messages that can to to a single device.</p>

<p>Price sensitivity. Can&#8217;t send a whole lot of messages.</p>

<p>Verizon WAP integration. Verizon doesn&#8217;t extract the URL.</p>

<p>Results -</p>

<p>Significant adoption among PC audience. A direct call to action resulted in a 10x increase in click through.</p>

<p>Great user feedback and press.</p>

<p>Interest internally among more Yahoo properties to launch &#8220;send to phone&#8221;</p>

<p>Next steps -</p>

<p>Extend to more properties.</p>

<p>Extend to MMS and other delivery mechanisms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fabrizio speaking at <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/04/april-mobile-monday-tonight.html">the April MoMo</a>.</p>

<p>Fabrizio is from <a href="http://sync4j.funambol.com/main.jsp?main=theproject">Funambol</a>, the company behind an open source SyncML project with more than 10,000 downloads to date.</p>

<p>SyncML does data management (contacts, appointments) and device management (&#8220;can you fix my device&#8221; and the carrier can fix the device remotely).</p>

<p>They take data from different sources and put it out over SyncML (ERP, CRM, Email servers).  Most devices already have a SyncML client installed (calendar, contacts, ie).</p>

<p>They also have clients for pocketpc, palm is coming.</p>

<p>They also have multiple APIs into the platform to put information from a datasource into a device, and then the device can work offline.</p>

<p>Lots of downloads, growing quickly, lots of developers, great ramp.</p>

<p>Today they are launching is a Sync4j portal. Free, come and use it. Contacts, calendar, plugin for outlook that puts data online, palm can upload, pocket pc can upload. Currently in alpha.</p>

<p>They need to get data from different sources (gmail calendar, yahoo address book), calendar with mozilla.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re putting up a database with all the devices and the SyncML support and how to use it.</p>

<p>If you need to develop a wireless app that needs data try Sync4J.  If you get it to work give Funambol some feedback. Want to add audio and pictures. info at funambol.com And if you want to work for a cool mobile open source company, mail him as well. Looking for marketing, presales engineers, that type of thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Igor Jablokov presenting at <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/04/april-mobile-monday-tonight.html">Mobile Monday</a> -</p>

<p>He was talking about a mixed voice and text interface, allowing users to speak at applications and application to speak back.  It has a markup that hooks into an existing application.  An example was given of voice enabling something like Friendster. I assume this is something like VoiceXML, which gave keywords and mappings to screen translations (state transitions).  There&#8217;s a W3C working group, and they&#8217;ve used existing W3C standards to build the markup they use. I think <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/pervasive/multimodal/">this is the right starting point</a> for more information about what he was talking about.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the problem with the mobile web? cumbersome and frusterating, lots of screens, keypads and screens are too small, UI for every mobile is different.</p>

<p>Providers - Want distance between licensed content and end users decreased.</p>

<p>14.8% of phone ownders use data services (that&#8217;s probably pretty optimistic) Cellular operaters want more users to use data services but adoption has been slow.</p>

<p>Eventually all the providers will be providing the same good enough service,  the differentiating feature will be the applications available.</p>

<p>Multimodal refers mixed voice and text interface. Both for the user input and for the output.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need a PHd in CS any more to develop a voice application.</p>

<p>They provide a markup that allows for voice interaction.</p>

<p>Opera will release a browser with voice capability, version 8 in about a month or so.</p>

<p>Extreme blue, an application they have. A multimodal social mobile service.</p>

<p>Lots of the capabilities are on the device currently (voice generation, voice browser), eventually that might go up to the server.  You can get the components necessary and run them with a relatively generic server architecture.Looks to be application server based (WebSphere, JBoss).  Too bad.</p>

<p>IBM leadership in speech.  More than 30 years. 250 speech patents. 100 researchers in 15 languages.</p>

<p>Speech interface is natural for a phone, people already talk into a phone. They don&#8217;t talk into a computer.</p>

<p>Some comparison with the SALT version from Microsoft, which apparently isn&#8217;t open standards based.</p>

<p>Single word can take you to the point you want. You should be able to just say &#8220;Help&#8221; or &#8220;Customer service&#8221; and get to the point you want.</p>

<p>Eclipse interface, drag and drop, but you can use any text editor to create it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a>  and I are off to New Orleans for a few days.  My cousin is getting married down there, and we&#8217;re extending the trip a bit to do some exploring.  I feel sorry to be leaving the <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> crew when there&#8217;s so much going on. But a promise is a promise, and I promised Elle a vacation in New Orleans.  I could deal with a little bit of rest myself. New Orleans food is good on it&#8217;s own, but we&#8217;ve got the inside track on this one. My cousin the French chef is marrying a pastry chef. Everyone winks and nods when I tell them I&#8217;m going to a wedding between two chefs down in New Orleans. Makes sense that this would be something to behold. I&#8217;ll try to remember to take plenty of pictures.</p>

<p>That said, I still can&#8217;t resist the urge to try out some of my gadgets in new ways.  I picked up a <a href="http://www.delorme.com/bluelogger/">Delorme Bluelogger</a> a while ago, and have fooled around with it to see if I could read out samples over Bluetooth. But this time I actually loaded up a map of New Orleans into my Clie and I&#8217;ll use that to wander around the streets with. Then I thought &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if I could note all the photos I take with my 6600 so I can pin them to a map when I get back?&#8221; I took a quick look around the interweb and didn&#8217;t see anything during my brief search.  If there&#8217;s something out there you know about please leave me a comment. I have Python on my phone, and <a href="http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/miso/">Miso</a> installed already (Miso has a module for taking pictures from within Python scripts). Should be pretty easy to hack up a quick script that takes a picture, samples the GPS, and then writes the image along with some location data to the filesystem. Wish this phone had an airline mode so that I could use it on the plane on the way down. It&#8217;s gonna be a tight squeeze trying to get this working before Elle gets annoyed that I&#8217;m programming and not vacationing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=471">posted about meeting Ewan at ETech</a>. The <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/techconf/2005/03/25/etech-part1/">podcast that he recorded during the ETech conf</a> is up now. It even got <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/24/the_podcast_network_.html">noticed over at BoingBoing</a>, which hopefully means great things for him! Ewan has also started doing <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/rock/2005/03/25/the-rock-show-01/">the Rock show for The Podcast Network</a>. My favorite track off the first edition? Falling as One by <a href="http://www.risetoaddiction.com/news.htm">Rise to Addiction</a>. I love to see RSS used for stuff like this, giving exposure to bands that really want it. Bands that are happy to release their recordings for free in order to gain an audience. It really helps to underscore the fact that protecting the existing recording companies and their contracts is NOT the only way to keep the music industry going. There are other models out there, there are artists not only willing to share, but actively looking for a chance to do so. Ewan is doing a great service by providing these bands a platform from which they can start evolving into the new medium, experimenting with a new way of finding their audience, and providing an introduction in both directions. Keep it coming Ewan!</p>
