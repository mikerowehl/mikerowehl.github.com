  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com">Niall</a> messaged me last night to show off the <a href="http://beta.technorati.com">beta site they&#8217;ve been working on at Technorati</a>. Very cool stuff!! One of the first things I noticed was the subscribe option for tags, so that you can get items associated with a tag output as RSS. I like the layout of the results page too. With the images down the side and the posts as the main body it provides <a href="http://beta.technorati.com/tag/mobilemonday">a great summary page for events</a> in particular. The &#8220;most discussed&#8221; lists and hot search terms are always interesting, although I know that I personally don&#8217;t actively use them often. I&#8217;m generally much more interested in what my friends are talking about than the sum of what everyone is talking about. The tab layout is interesting as well. I&#8217;ve seen that implemented poorly quite often, but the implementation they have is very solid and clean. When I took a look at the source and saw an AJAX Javascript library I assumed it would be for the search box, to provide a completion list of commonly used terms and sources. I didn&#8217;t see that in using the interface however. None of the mobile browsers I&#8217;ve tried out yet support the features necessary to use AJAX, so I&#8217;ve been trying to pay some attention to where it shows up. Wherever it is, it doesn&#8217;t seem to impact using the site from a Treo or when using <a href="http://skweezer.com">Skweezer</a>.</p>

<p>Update: Changed the link used an example for event summary. I posted this from my Treo and had grabbed the wrong saved URL.  The tag page has photos down the side around the post results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey all, sorry I wasn&#8217;t able to make the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a> meeting last night. I set it all up, but then I wasn&#8217;t able to make it myself. I just had way more than is reasonable or humanly actionable to do at work. Kinda makes me sad, but mostly makes me filled with murderous rage. That&#8217;s just the way it goes however. Some people say when life gives you  lemons you should make lemonade. I say when life gives you lemons just jump up and scream &#8220;Hey! What&#8217;s with the lemons!?!? This isn&#8217;t what I asked for!!&#8221; and start chucking lemons at anyone that comes into view. They really hurt apparently. Always makes me feel better at least. I find it helps to have a blog to vent into also. We have a <a href="http://fusion94.org/archives/2005/06/new_job.html">very kick ass new addition to Feedster however</a>, so hopefully not only will my workload be getting somewhere more near normal, I might not be ignoring things in order to get it there. I would like to get things normal enough that we can have the mobile homebrew meetings again. I think that was a good idea, we just needed a little more practice with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you probably didn&#8217;t hear it here first, but <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/06/feedster_closes.html">Feedster has closed a round of funding</a>! Nothing like a little bank to help power through <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=515">some issues</a>. And things do seem to be powering along. I have no idea if I&#8217;m allowed to mention who&#8217;s joined up recently, but there are some kick ass folks joining the team. Definitely sorely needed. And there are others in line on the way in. Having a solid team come together was a major concern for me. It&#8217;s hard to ramp up such a small group. Mixing in two people to a group of ten is one kind of problem. Mixing in more than half the original group size gets into some strange group dynamics. So the next few months should be really telling. The systems have decomposed so far into completely distinct territories. One engineer worked on one system, and in general the systems broke down along well defined API boundaries. That&#8217;s not going to be the case any more, and the kind of engineering capability required to deal with that is much different than what we&#8217;ve practiced so far. I&#8217;ve been an avid user of revision control systems (CVS, Subversion, and most recently <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">GNU Arch</a>), that just grew naturally out of participating in a bunch of open source projects. As it turns out, those systems are an enormous boost when everyone knows how to use them already. But most people that I know get familiar with the &#8220;concurrent version system&#8221; methodology working on some side project and then carry it back into their work environment (classic disruptive behavior, I love it, but that&#8217;s another story). A bunch of the startups I&#8217;ve been at actually have that whole methodology baked right into the corporate DNA. The core of engineering work flows through that shared revision control system. And after a little while the concurrent version system becomes your primary collaboration tool. There&#8217;s less and less email, fewer calls, and no one throws things over the cubicle wall to get your attention any more.</p>

<p>So we come back to my original idea, which I almost forgot in my rambling. Companies structured around this open source methodology concept have a pretty natural path to scaling. The structure is instantiated inline with a revision control system that allows multiple people to just keep working and help them resolve conflicts down the line, which didn&#8217;t exist in specification driven engineering organizations I&#8217;ve been at. There are a bunch of little benefits that factor into making it a good way to work in my mind, but the principal I&#8217;m looking at now is that it&#8217;s very easy to bring new people in. So although it really seems at first glance to look like a trivial administrative task once you learn how to use it (it&#8217;s easy to forget how the concurrent version way of thinking transforms your work once you grok it) I think from an engineering standpoint the most important thing after having a good team might be having a good concurrent version system that everyone understands. It really can (and maybe should?) stand at the core of execution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After staying up till 5am this morning trying to get myself a bit caught up on news and various bits of hackery, my hands were killing me this morning. I normally use a <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">funky ergonomic contour keyboard from Kinesis</a>. It&#8217;s a complete lifesaver. I can&#8217;t live without it apparently. I tried last night, and have proven that statement to be absolutely true. I need that keyboard in order to work for long stretches without causing problems. I stopped using the keyboard when I made the switch because I didn&#8217;t know how to use it with the Mac (Powerbook, running OS X). Odd that one should have issues like &#8220;how to use a keyboard&#8221;, but unfortunately it is true. Lots of operations on a Mac require use of the apple/funky-squigly-four-leaf-clover-dealie key. Apparently called the &#8220;command&#8221; key in Mac parlance, but labeled only with pictograms. Lets call it the branding key, cause I think that&#8217;s what it really is. And it&#8217;s more descriptive than the &#8220;command&#8221; key, which I would expect to be labeled with something like, oh.. &#8220;Cmd&#8221;. When I say &#8220;branding key&#8221; to people who have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, they spot the apple key pretty quick. When I say &#8220;command key&#8221; they just can the keyboard over and over, eventually asking &#8220;You mean the control key?&#8221;</p>

<p>The branding key is pretty essential. Switching applications and windows, cut, paste. All necessary stuff for keeping you from reaching for the mouse, which destroys a lot the benefit of the good keyboard. But today it was too painful, I had to use the Kinesis, and I had to figure out how to create a branding key on a (GASP!) standard US keyboard. Russ pointed me to <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/">DoubleCommand</a>, which lets you remap keys under OS X. Perfect. All I had to do was install that, set the flag that says &#8220;Option key acts as command key&#8221;, and I was all set. Now I can hold down Alt on the Kinesis and it has the same effect as the branding key on the built in keyboard. The shooting pains have all but stopped, and I think I should be able to feel my fingertips again by the end of the day. Happy dance!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mobility is a really hot topic now in the valley, and people always ask me if I know any good talent they can try to tap for their new product/service/startup. Well folks, <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2005/06/as_nokia_lifebl.html">here you go</a>. Christian Lindholm is looking for the next thing, having successfully brought <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog/">Lifeblog</a> from concept to standard component in the new NSeries of Nokia phones. Folks simply don&#8217;t come any more mobile savvy, enthusiastic, and insightful than Christian. I hope someone in the Bay Area can attract his attention, we need people like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we were <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ifindkarma/16287087/">over at Adam and Michelle Rifkin&#8217;s place for a BBQ</a>, and as it was about time to go back home <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">Tantek</a> asks &#8220;Hey, are you guys going to <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.com/Beta">SuperHappyDevHouse</a> tonight?&#8221; Oh, he&#8217;s good! We spent a bit of time debating if the car was going into the water or coming out, and promptly decided that the only sane thing to do was to head over and find out.</p>

<p>It was great. Geeks and hackers spread out all over the place doing geekish and hackery stuff. <a href="http://david.weekly.org/">David Weekly</a> got the event together, it was his house that we went to. They had a <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.com/wiki/index.cgi?HomePage">wiki available for posting project info</a> and an IRC channel for the event. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t hang out till dawn, we were pretty beat after the BBQ. We did swap around some mobile apps and have some great conversations, but I wish I had known the geekery of the gathering before heading out there.  I would have brought my GPS unit and the charger to see who else wanted to hack mapping projects. We never did find out if the car was going into the water or coming out.</p>
