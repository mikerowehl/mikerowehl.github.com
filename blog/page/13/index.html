  <div class="entry-content"><p>It started as a joke to Noel about the spam I get touting 532 nanometer green lasers available in bulk. That ranks up there with the spam for industrial conveyor belts. Do people needing large numbers of green lasers and industrial supplies go looking around in spam for their purchasing needs? Rolex watches, sure. Scam credit relief, sure. Porn, definitely. But industrial supplies? I just can&#8217;t comprehend what chain of events would lead to that spam generating the required return for the generations of the emails to be worthwhile. Some poor schlep wanders into their bosses office to be brought up short with a request to come up with &#8220;a few dozen green lasers, STAT!&#8221; The schlep sits down at their computer, the <a href="http://www.us.mentos.com/">Mentos</a> commercial music starts playing, and magically an email appears to answer their sudden and pressing laser needs? Far fetched at best. And Noel replies with &#8220;Or radioactive isotopes.&#8221; Yep, you got that right. Radioactive fricking isotopes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unitednuclear.com/"><img src="http://www.unitednuclear.com/nerd.gif" alt="Cheesy 70s ad and all!!" /></a></p>

<p>Noel says, go over to <a href="http://www.unitednuclear.com/">http://www.unitednuclear.com/</a> and check it out. Sho &#8216;nuff, <a href="http://www.unitednuclear.com/isotopes.htm">radioactive fricking isotopes</a> in all their animated-gif-spinning-red-and-green-text-spammer-generated-page glory. &#8220;It&#8217;s a joke, or a hoax&#8221; I say to myself as I do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=united+nuclear">a Google search</a>. No, I&#8217;m not so sure it is. Looks like the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/1997/97-010iv.html">Nuclear Regulatory Commission was pissed at them because they apparently &#8220;intentionally provided false information to the NRC&#8221;</a>. I&#8217;m not sure which one causes me more concern: the version where traffic in fake radioactive material is profitable enough to be spamworthy, or the version where the radioactive material actually shows up after you place an order. Mostly I just think I&#8217;m gonna stop joking with Noel about things like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went over to the <a href="http://kron4.com/Global/story.asp?S=3462860">blogger meetup at KRON</a> yesterday. It was pretty much what I expected out of the event. The KRON folks were surprisingly and refreshingly honest in saying they had no idea what to do about blogging, but they want to start getting involved in the community. They&#8217;re going to be maintaining a list of Bay Area bloggers. <a href="http://www.endofthetour.com/">Courtney</a> already has a <a href="http://www.sfbaybloggers.com/">site called SFBayBloggers.com</a> that lists bloggers from the Bay Area, it would be cool to see them throw some support her way instead of starting up another list. KRON is also going to be aggregating posts from the local blogs and providing some metacommentary. Would be nice to see the information flow both ways. <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/06/kron_blogger_ga.html">Niall mentions getting KRON to use Creative Commons</a> on some of the content it releases, I think that would be a fantastic way to kick it off.</p>

<p>There were a few people who were disturbed by KRON aggregating stories from local publishers and commenting on them. I&#8217;ve come to think about &#8220;my content&#8221; online much different than I used to, mostly because I&#8217;ve been working with and around people who make their money from advertising. Many of them who come from the traditional publishing side are concerned with controlling their content, making sure that they make some scratch every time someone reads their words or sees their images or hears their audio. The folks from the new media side are much more accepting of trading their content for traffic. They don&#8217;t mind if someone takes snips of their stories and republishes them, as long as credit is given and traffic flows back their way. I think that just comes down to the difference between broadcast and online mediums. It makes sense to try to control your content when you broadcast because following attribution has a much higher activation energy for someone receiving a broadcast. Whereas online a link to the original source is much more likely to get the receiver to act. I think understanding that is the best way to come up with ways to interact with the bloggers. Sure, there are some who don&#8217;t want any more traffic because their bandwidth costs are already too high. But for most of them they would be happy to just get traffic. KRON controls a lot more traffic than most of the bloggers in the area, and using their position to help send traffic to the local blogs would give KRON a new pool of content to pull from and give the local bloggers what they want in return. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s just about what I heard at the meeting, so all in all I think it was a great start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2005/06.html#d10t0159">Tantek&#8217;s post</a> about <a href="http://www.tagtuesday.com/">Tag Tuesday</a>. Cool stuff! There are a whole bunch of gatherings and get-togethers and parties and roundtables, it just feels like a very exciting time. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t make it to all of them, but I will be at the Tag Tuesday meeting. Feedster has been doing some <a href="http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/archives/2005/05/future_salon_an_1.html">work on tagging</a>, and although it falls outside of what I&#8217;ve been working on it is an area I&#8217;m interested in. Unfortunately <a href="http://fusion94.org/">Tony</a> won&#8217;t be in town next week, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be a great time to meet a big chunk of the people working on the topic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com">Niall</a> messaged me last night to show off the <a href="http://beta.technorati.com">beta site they&#8217;ve been working on at Technorati</a>. Very cool stuff!! One of the first things I noticed was the subscribe option for tags, so that you can get items associated with a tag output as RSS. I like the layout of the results page too. With the images down the side and the posts as the main body it provides <a href="http://beta.technorati.com/tag/mobilemonday">a great summary page for events</a> in particular. The &#8220;most discussed&#8221; lists and hot search terms are always interesting, although I know that I personally don&#8217;t actively use them often. I&#8217;m generally much more interested in what my friends are talking about than the sum of what everyone is talking about. The tab layout is interesting as well. I&#8217;ve seen that implemented poorly quite often, but the implementation they have is very solid and clean. When I took a look at the source and saw an AJAX Javascript library I assumed it would be for the search box, to provide a completion list of commonly used terms and sources. I didn&#8217;t see that in using the interface however. None of the mobile browsers I&#8217;ve tried out yet support the features necessary to use AJAX, so I&#8217;ve been trying to pay some attention to where it shows up. Wherever it is, it doesn&#8217;t seem to impact using the site from a Treo or when using <a href="http://skweezer.com">Skweezer</a>.</p>

<p>Update: Changed the link used an example for event summary. I posted this from my Treo and had grabbed the wrong saved URL.  The tag page has photos down the side around the post results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey all, sorry I wasn&#8217;t able to make the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a> meeting last night. I set it all up, but then I wasn&#8217;t able to make it myself. I just had way more than is reasonable or humanly actionable to do at work. Kinda makes me sad, but mostly makes me filled with murderous rage. That&#8217;s just the way it goes however. Some people say when life gives you  lemons you should make lemonade. I say when life gives you lemons just jump up and scream &#8220;Hey! What&#8217;s with the lemons!?!? This isn&#8217;t what I asked for!!&#8221; and start chucking lemons at anyone that comes into view. They really hurt apparently. Always makes me feel better at least. I find it helps to have a blog to vent into also. We have a <a href="http://fusion94.org/archives/2005/06/new_job.html">very kick ass new addition to Feedster however</a>, so hopefully not only will my workload be getting somewhere more near normal, I might not be ignoring things in order to get it there. I would like to get things normal enough that we can have the mobile homebrew meetings again. I think that was a good idea, we just needed a little more practice with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you probably didn&#8217;t hear it here first, but <a href="http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/06/feedster_closes.html">Feedster has closed a round of funding</a>! Nothing like a little bank to help power through <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=515">some issues</a>. And things do seem to be powering along. I have no idea if I&#8217;m allowed to mention who&#8217;s joined up recently, but there are some kick ass folks joining the team. Definitely sorely needed. And there are others in line on the way in. Having a solid team come together was a major concern for me. It&#8217;s hard to ramp up such a small group. Mixing in two people to a group of ten is one kind of problem. Mixing in more than half the original group size gets into some strange group dynamics. So the next few months should be really telling. The systems have decomposed so far into completely distinct territories. One engineer worked on one system, and in general the systems broke down along well defined API boundaries. That&#8217;s not going to be the case any more, and the kind of engineering capability required to deal with that is much different than what we&#8217;ve practiced so far. I&#8217;ve been an avid user of revision control systems (CVS, Subversion, and most recently <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">GNU Arch</a>), that just grew naturally out of participating in a bunch of open source projects. As it turns out, those systems are an enormous boost when everyone knows how to use them already. But most people that I know get familiar with the &#8220;concurrent version system&#8221; methodology working on some side project and then carry it back into their work environment (classic disruptive behavior, I love it, but that&#8217;s another story). A bunch of the startups I&#8217;ve been at actually have that whole methodology baked right into the corporate DNA. The core of engineering work flows through that shared revision control system. And after a little while the concurrent version system becomes your primary collaboration tool. There&#8217;s less and less email, fewer calls, and no one throws things over the cubicle wall to get your attention any more.</p>

<p>So we come back to my original idea, which I almost forgot in my rambling. Companies structured around this open source methodology concept have a pretty natural path to scaling. The structure is instantiated inline with a revision control system that allows multiple people to just keep working and help them resolve conflicts down the line, which didn&#8217;t exist in specification driven engineering organizations I&#8217;ve been at. There are a bunch of little benefits that factor into making it a good way to work in my mind, but the principal I&#8217;m looking at now is that it&#8217;s very easy to bring new people in. So although it really seems at first glance to look like a trivial administrative task once you learn how to use it (it&#8217;s easy to forget how the concurrent version way of thinking transforms your work once you grok it) I think from an engineering standpoint the most important thing after having a good team might be having a good concurrent version system that everyone understands. It really can (and maybe should?) stand at the core of execution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After staying up till 5am this morning trying to get myself a bit caught up on news and various bits of hackery, my hands were killing me this morning. I normally use a <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">funky ergonomic contour keyboard from Kinesis</a>. It&#8217;s a complete lifesaver. I can&#8217;t live without it apparently. I tried last night, and have proven that statement to be absolutely true. I need that keyboard in order to work for long stretches without causing problems. I stopped using the keyboard when I made the switch because I didn&#8217;t know how to use it with the Mac (Powerbook, running OS X). Odd that one should have issues like &#8220;how to use a keyboard&#8221;, but unfortunately it is true. Lots of operations on a Mac require use of the apple/funky-squigly-four-leaf-clover-dealie key. Apparently called the &#8220;command&#8221; key in Mac parlance, but labeled only with pictograms. Lets call it the branding key, cause I think that&#8217;s what it really is. And it&#8217;s more descriptive than the &#8220;command&#8221; key, which I would expect to be labeled with something like, oh.. &#8220;Cmd&#8221;. When I say &#8220;branding key&#8221; to people who have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, they spot the apple key pretty quick. When I say &#8220;command key&#8221; they just can the keyboard over and over, eventually asking &#8220;You mean the control key?&#8221;</p>

<p>The branding key is pretty essential. Switching applications and windows, cut, paste. All necessary stuff for keeping you from reaching for the mouse, which destroys a lot the benefit of the good keyboard. But today it was too painful, I had to use the Kinesis, and I had to figure out how to create a branding key on a (GASP!) standard US keyboard. Russ pointed me to <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/">DoubleCommand</a>, which lets you remap keys under OS X. Perfect. All I had to do was install that, set the flag that says &#8220;Option key acts as command key&#8221;, and I was all set. Now I can hold down Alt on the Kinesis and it has the same effect as the branding key on the built in keyboard. The shooting pains have all but stopped, and I think I should be able to feel my fingertips again by the end of the day. Happy dance!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mobility is a really hot topic now in the valley, and people always ask me if I know any good talent they can try to tap for their new product/service/startup. Well folks, <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2005/06/as_nokia_lifebl.html">here you go</a>. Christian Lindholm is looking for the next thing, having successfully brought <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog/">Lifeblog</a> from concept to standard component in the new NSeries of Nokia phones. Folks simply don&#8217;t come any more mobile savvy, enthusiastic, and insightful than Christian. I hope someone in the Bay Area can attract his attention, we need people like this.</p>
