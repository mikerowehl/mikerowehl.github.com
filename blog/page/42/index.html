  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Feature has <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100500&amp;ref=727157">an article about carriers trying to make money off moblogging</a>. I think the point about complex cost structures and interoperability being a major barrier is excellent. I agree that there&#8217;s a lot that carriers should be doing to ease the technical hurdles for their users. I liked this line from right at the start of the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Moblogs weren&#8217;t likely on the radar when manufacturers and carriers introduced cameraphones, but they&#8217;ve become one of, if not the most, popular use of the devices.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that&#8217;s an important aspect for the carries to bear in mind. The most major driver of the use of this technology is an application that grew up from the bottom organically. There was no mass push by a consumer organization or a hardware manufacturer to get the infrastructure of moblogging setup. It was innovative individuals who decided to turn this new technology to scratch a personal itch. So what&#8217;s the best way to make sure that the medium keeps growing and that carriers get the money back on their investment? It&#8217;s not by trying to push out new applications grown internally, or by trying to push the existing services to new levels. The best thing to do is to grease the gears a bit, make it easier for users to do what they&#8217;re doing and attempt to make it easier for them to play with new uses. Maybe setup mechanisms to try to catch what users are saying about their desired usages and attempt to respond (although this can admittedly be tricky). But most importantly, lower the barriers and just stay the hell out of the way!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday the 2.6 version of the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME desktop</a> was released. Most people are going to have to wait until their vendor makes it available, but those looking to live on the bleeding edge can always download it and compile on their own. ArsTechnica has <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/004/software/gnome-2.6/gnome-2.6-1.html">an overview article</a> on their site. As mentioned in the article, there are a few tools to help out with downloading and compiling the new version. <a href="http://www.akcaagac.com/index_cvsgnome.html">CVSGnome</a> actually has info about the 2.6 release on the main page, so I&#8217;ll probably try that one out. There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/">GARNOME</a> system, but I have no idea how up to date that is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Feature has the first of what is going to be a four part series on mobile design, <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100488&amp;ref=727157">Listening to Users</a>. The list of points there should be pretty familiar to anyone who has ever taken even a passing interest in design. It&#8217;s not even surprizing any more to hear that basic design issues are overlooked by the tech industry. There are a couple of good general points in there however. Such as catering to the &#8220;silver surfers&#8221; (older users) who often can&#8217;t use the eternally shrinking mobile devices on the market today because they need larger buttons and bigger displays. And I particularly liked this:</p>

<blockquote><p>For mobile retailers, Stuart sees one of their great weaknesses as not letting customers play with a charged handset. This is the opportunity to show off the product and make them want it. In reality, many shops still have plastic models and locked cupboards.</p></blockquote>

<p>I always thought that was pretty dumb, happy to hear someone else echo that. The same goes for PDAs in retail shops. I don&#8217;t give a crap about the foam models, or gutted cases. The reason I stopped in the PDA section was to find out what the thing really does. If I could toy with it I might be tempted by buy right then. But if I need to go back and research device capability online, I&#8217;m gonna buy online.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.sentonline.com/">SENT exhibit</a> of phonecam art was supposed to get under way during February of 2004 I thought.

There&#8217;s still a link up at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, so I&#8217;m assuming the event is still planned to go on. I mailed Xeni to see if I could get some more info. Sounded kooky and interesting, I&#8217;m sad to see that interest seems to have petered out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a decent amount of discussion about prototype based programming lately, with two new projects called <a href="http://www.prothon.org/">Prothon</a> and <a href="http://slate.tunes.org/">Slate</a> getting most of the press. So all of this gets the question, what the hell is a prototype based programming language? There&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_based">definition in the Wikipedia</a> which can shed a bit of light on it. The <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/papers/self-power.html">description of Self</a> from the Self site gets a bit heady, but their explanation of the fundamental nature of message passing and the benefits provided in terms of maintenance are worth the time. If you&#8217;re looking for a really quick description check out the <a href="http://www.prothon.org/description.htm">Prothon description</a>. Or go searching through the resources for any of the <a href="http://www.dekorte.com/Proto/Chart.html">other prototype based languages</a>.. there seem to be quite a few. Most of them I&#8217;ve never even heard of.</p>

<p>My main question is why is there a sudden surge in interest for these languages? Are people just now coming to see the benefits? I hadn&#8217;t heard of prototype based objects before, so maybe the concepts just got laid in front of the right people at the right time. Self seems to be a very young system, so maybe the concepts weren&#8217;t well explored yet. But given the capabilities of the systems, such as being able to change behavior of objects &#8220;on the fly&#8221; and the ability to include active variables implicitly (see the Self paper for why this is), I&#8217;m wondering if the interest stems somewhat from the System Oriented Architecture and Web Services pushes going on. When your business process becomes an always on application of distributed objects you have a strong motivator to search for the ultimate runtime flexibility so you can fix problems with the system still up and running. Just a thought. To me it seems there&#8217;s a very good match there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I forget how I ended up there, but I was reading Michael Sippey&#8217;s post <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/03/timeline.html">about keeping a timeline of major events for the year</a>. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sippey.com/timeline/">an example at his site</a>. I like it. There should be tools to handle these formats for the Palm platform. Open source tools. When I run across an iCal file online I should be able to add it DIRECTLY to my Palm, not just setup a desktop app that can sync it over. Ditto for RSS and Atom feeds. There should be an open source datebook app that supports calendar layering. And a feed reader. At the minimum. There should be a full Atom interface application, but a feed reader would be a nice start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Feature has <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100482&amp;ref=716084">an article about location based services being deployed and experimented with today</a>. It includes a pointer to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1176995,00.html">an article in The Guardian</a> with information about <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=201">Urban Tapestries</a> and <a href="http://www.nfc-forum.org/">Near Field Communication</a>. I had heard that NFC was a combined project to form an open platform for location based services, but I didn&#8217;t know much detail. This is from the article in The Guardian:</p>

<blockquote><p>Philips and Sony say: &#8220;NFC can be used for quickly establishing other types of wireless communication between devices, acting as a virtual connector. By bringing two devices into close vicinity, it can invisibly configure and initialise other wireless protocols such as Bluetooth and 802.11 (eg Wi-Fi), enabling devices to communicate at longer ranges or transfer data at higher rates. In an environment rich with wireless-enabled devices, it&#8217;s the easy way to set up connections without needing to go through complicated menus.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting, I had never heard it described that way. I wonder if that&#8217;s really the main direction the forum is looking at. I know the the RFID people are <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0121943/2004/02/04.html">considering using either EPC or IPV6</a> as their lookup system. I wonder how this would fit into that scheme in general. Complementary? Opposing? I think location based services kick ass, and I think they would provide a lot of value to end users and generate some really innovative applications in general. But I&#8217;m very concerned that the underlying technologies don&#8217;t seem to cary the level of openness I would like to see. In order to see location based services take off, it&#8217;s not going to be enough to provide a few standards that telcom providers can roll out when they see fit. Most telcom providers will never see fit unless there&#8217;s immediate money to be made. What&#8217;s needed is a completely open platform which can be deployed despite and around other major impediments, without any infrastructure changes. That&#8217;s the impression I got from the NFC site, that it&#8217;s the kind of tech that could be deployed now. Handsets would need some extra  functions, servers would need to be made available. But it&#8217;s not the type of thing that would require replacing or reprogramming service side equiptment. For instance I remember a lot of  talk about the Enhanced 911 service for cell phones leading to location based services.. but as far I know know it&#8217;s either difficult of impossible to get that information from providers. It&#8217;s my hope the NFC will provide a way to avoid those kinds of issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to reading <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">Small Pieces Loosely Joined</a> as a whole. It&#8217;s one of those books that I&#8217;ve heard so much about and read so many quotes from that I felt like I would already have a good feel for what it was really about. But once I started reading it I realized it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s good just because it&#8217;s insightful, but because everyone sees issues relevant to their own point of view. So of course now I feel like a wonk for not having read it sooner. I should have known I was in for something different when the book started going into a description of all kinds of mapping efforts for the Internet. I&#8217;m sitting in my home office, the walls covered with the <a href="http://www.lumeta.com/news/pressreleases.php?pr_ID=10">poster versions of the Cheswick maps</a> from three years and with a copy of the <a href="http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/atlas.html">Atlas of Cyberspace</a> sitting on my table, and I&#8217;m reading a book that starts out with a description of space as applied to the Internet. It gave me this sense of personal connection with the material, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that just about everyone who reads it and has spent time on the Internet will see something of themselves in some part of it. That&#8217;s probably why David Weinberger did such a great job of pulling together a unified theory of the Internet. He seems to inherently understand the duality of mass communication and personal address. The book comes off excellently, and to the other people out there who might be thinking &#8220;Oh yea, I&#8217;ve heard about that book a thousand times, I know what it&#8217;s all about.&#8221; I encourage you to go pick up a copy anyway. Even if you do know all the major subject topics, there&#8217;s a lot to be learned from the nuance and presentation as well.</p>
