  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/002983.html">According to SmartMobs</a> there&#8217;s a fundraiser in San Francisco for a new organization called <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a>. They seem to be into some interesting stuff. This is from their about page on their website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Public Knowledge is a new public-interest advocacy organization dedicated to fortifying and defending a vibrant information commons. This Washington, D.C. based group works with wide spectrum of stakeholders - libraries, educators, scientists, artists, musicians, journalists, consumers, software programmers, civic groups and enlightened businesses - to promote the core conviction that some fundamental democratic principles and cultural values - openness, access, and the capacity to create and compete - must be given new embodiment in the digital age.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m one of them software programmer people, I&#8217;m registered. Maybe I&#8217;ll see some of you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Slashdot linked to the <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/macwarriors/projects/trailblazer/">TrailBlazer</a> project a little while ago. TrailBlazer is a nice visual layout for browser history that should make it easier to get back to a site if you&#8217;ve forgotten to bookmark it. It seems like an excellent idea, but I figured that there would already be a <a href="http://www.mozdev.org/categories/">plugin for Mozilla</a> to provide some sort of enhanced history features. But there isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m actually considering dabbling in Mozilla based development&#8230; maybe this would be a good place to start hacking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Clay Shirky has a <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html">post titled Situated Software</a> available online. There are some excellent general points in there, but I&#8217;m left with a nagging feeling about the piece as a whole. I think there are some aspects which he captures well, but there are other areas which I think are still major hang-ups for the software community as a whole.  Allow me to give an example. I do something I call software prototyping. For some people this makes infinite sense right off the bat, but most say something like &#8220;What do you mean by prototyping? What do you prototype?&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t really matter what I prototype, because prototyping properly done is all about a discovery and exploration process not about particular technologies. In the course of prototyping I end up implementing a lot of small and relatively pointed systems. At one point in the essay Clay says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Businesses routinely ask teams of well-paid people to put hundreds of hours of work creating a single PowerPoint deck that will be looked at in a single meeting. The idea that software should be built for many users, or last for many years, are cultural assumptions not required by the software itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just concentrating on an area that I shouldn&#8217;t be, but I&#8217;ve written applications to be used in EXACTLY the same sense. I&#8217;ve written programs which were meant to be used just for a single presentation. And if that presentation went well the understanding was that the application would be developed out if needed. I&#8217;ve also done plenty of programming on small systems meant to be used by limited groups, like 4 people working on a shared website. I think that the general availability of open source programs has made it very easy to cobble together example applications and simple limited use solutions.</p>

<p>I think these usages have always existed to some degree. And I think that Clay&#8217;s point about the &#8220;that won&#8217;t scale&#8221; argument is well placed. That argument has killed a lot of worthwhile discussion. But there&#8217;s another area, the &#8220;that already exists&#8221; argument of good software engineering. I get crap from experienced programmers all the time because I build applications with an eye toward user needs, and not an eye toward existing implementations. And it is hard to balance these two requirements. Sometimes the right way to deal with a problem is to slightly tweak an existing application, sometimes the problem requires a different outlook altogether. How does one know when they&#8217;re taking the proper approach to servicing a subgroup of users and when they&#8217;re simply &#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221; without justification? I think this is an area that will remain unresolved for a long time. Hopefully the end scarcity that he talks about will spur some reversal of this tyranny of software engineering. I would certainly like to see more engineers in a position where they feel they can experiment with solutions before having to commit. This does require a major ethos change, but I think it would be for the best.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, if you haven&#8217;t seen <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>, which is linked to at the beginning of the post, it&#8217;s a very interesting read. I don&#8217;t think I had run across that before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Feature has an <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100501&amp;ref=716084">article about a location based game called Mogi</a>. I&#8217;m not a gamer at all, but I am into location based services. The way this game is run is just fantastic however. It encourages communication and cooperation, and emphasized collecting over combat. The game is described as a &#8220;data-layer over the city of Tokyo&#8221;, which I picture being very much like the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=201">Urban Tapestries</a> project. It&#8217;s also setup so that it encourages users on mobile devices to work together with others back at desktop systems. The comments from the game play make it sound like the goal of fitting collaborative authoring into everyday life would be something that&#8217;s possible:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Mogi] is a good example of a style of entertainment suited for mobile devices. It&#8217;s very casual, playable on your way somewhere. It nestles in your every day life, rather than requiring you to change your behavior &#8230; It amplifies your ordinary behavior - it changes going on an errand into a piece of a game.</p></blockquote>

<p>If a game can do it, a public authoring system should be able to. And check out this comment from Paul Baron (admittedly a Mogi evangelist):</p>

<blockquote><p>All the trips I make in the city are now randomized, as I will often divert a few hundred meters to go and collect an object around me. I get a chance to discover parts of the city that I ignored, a motivation to check out that parallel street I never took.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fantastic, I take that to be one of the main goals of public authoring. Reconnecting people in urban settings so that they get more of a shared experience. Drawing people out of their normal routines is a great way to get started. I think there are probably some fantastic lessons to be learned from this. I&#8217;m certainly going to be keeping my eye on <a href="http://www.in-duce.net/archives/mogi_item_hunt.php">Paul Baron&#8217;s</a> updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Feature has <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100500&amp;ref=727157">an article about carriers trying to make money off moblogging</a>. I think the point about complex cost structures and interoperability being a major barrier is excellent. I agree that there&#8217;s a lot that carriers should be doing to ease the technical hurdles for their users. I liked this line from right at the start of the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Moblogs weren&#8217;t likely on the radar when manufacturers and carriers introduced cameraphones, but they&#8217;ve become one of, if not the most, popular use of the devices.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that&#8217;s an important aspect for the carries to bear in mind. The most major driver of the use of this technology is an application that grew up from the bottom organically. There was no mass push by a consumer organization or a hardware manufacturer to get the infrastructure of moblogging setup. It was innovative individuals who decided to turn this new technology to scratch a personal itch. So what&#8217;s the best way to make sure that the medium keeps growing and that carriers get the money back on their investment? It&#8217;s not by trying to push out new applications grown internally, or by trying to push the existing services to new levels. The best thing to do is to grease the gears a bit, make it easier for users to do what they&#8217;re doing and attempt to make it easier for them to play with new uses. Maybe setup mechanisms to try to catch what users are saying about their desired usages and attempt to respond (although this can admittedly be tricky). But most importantly, lower the barriers and just stay the hell out of the way!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday the 2.6 version of the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME desktop</a> was released. Most people are going to have to wait until their vendor makes it available, but those looking to live on the bleeding edge can always download it and compile on their own. ArsTechnica has <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/004/software/gnome-2.6/gnome-2.6-1.html">an overview article</a> on their site. As mentioned in the article, there are a few tools to help out with downloading and compiling the new version. <a href="http://www.akcaagac.com/index_cvsgnome.html">CVSGnome</a> actually has info about the 2.6 release on the main page, so I&#8217;ll probably try that one out. There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/">GARNOME</a> system, but I have no idea how up to date that is.</p>
