  <div class="entry-content"><p>Presenting</p>

<p>What and How - most people concentrate too much on what and not how.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>start at the end: pitch decay says that most people forget very quickly. You need to find the most important 10 percent are really drive it. Put your most important point right up front, first slide.</p></li>
<li><p>be brief: all VCs have attention deficit disorder. Kill geek speak.</p></li>
<li><p>Bait the hook: get them interested. You don&#8217;t want your elevator pitch to close a deal, you want them to get off the elevator with you and ask for more info. Call to action.</p></li>
<li><p>Get high and stay high, stay up at a high level so that you talk about what and benefits, not how. They will ask for how when they are ready.</p></li>
<li><p>obey the 12/15 rule, a dozen slides in 15 minutes. An hour meeting does not mean an hour worth of slides. He had a list of what should be on the slides, I&#8217;ll fill in the details here at another point.</p></li>
<li><p>Change peoples pulse: audience, band with them, communicate on their level.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell stories that sell: Questions to ask when preventing are.What are the three most important things you could learn about my company. What interested you about our business plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Geta transition: Ask a rhetorical question.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice and integrate feedback: videotape yourself, use a timer to make sure you can do your pitch in the time you have.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop an attitude: never give up</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Most important are begin with the end, be brief, change peoples pulse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Positioning and Presenting</p>

<p>The Art of Positioning</p>

<h1>1 problem - talking about what you do concisely. Two points are market definition and value proposition.</h1>

<p>It will take many hours. Early on it&#8217;s a living document, but eventually you wanr to freeze it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Foundations&#8221;</p>

<p>Who do you do things for, market position.</p>

<p>What are you doing, value proposition.</p>

<p>Once you have the foundations down, use them as the yardstick for your other communications.</p>

<p>Case study of Bitpass</p>

<p>Phase 1 - everything is free</p>

<p>Phase 2 - Paid subscriptions</p>

<p>Phase 3 - Individual purchases</p>

<p>Primary - content sellers, Secondary - digital content buyers.</p>

<p>It can take an hour to get a group to agree to what primary is. Just follow the cash, they should be the biggest part of the pie <em>at the point at which you break even</em>. What comes out of finding these groups is a clear market definition.</p>

<p>What Bitpass decided was that the primary are teir one providers.</p>

<p>Next identify the burning problem. The only thing selling these days are painkillers (not steroids or vitamins). Then identify symptoms (how do I know if I have this problem?). Then put them all back together and try to find common aspects, and then refine the burning problem.</p>

<p>Once you have the burning problem you need to find the pain associated with it. Your key constituent must be able to instantly identify with the Burning Problem and Big Pain.</p>

<p>What kind of emotion is associated with the problem or pain?</p>

<p>Create the company tagline. The tagline should &#8220;hoom em&#8221; and get them to ask for more.</p>

<p>Market definition is pulled together from those previous answers (who, pain, and emotion).</p>

<p>What do you really do. List everything, and pick stuff out later on. Boil them down once you have the list. This is the composite essence of what you do.</p>

<p>Your value proposition. Category + position parameters + benefits.</p>

<p>So you end up with who, pain, emotion on one side and painkillers and benefits. Yin and Yang.</p>

<p>Generally things take the form of the problem being in the negative, and the solution positive.</p>

<p>Competition, make a page for each competitor. This is done from the point of view of outsiders. Pick everyone who a knowledgable outsider would think is a competitor. Be comprehensive, and consider grouping is there are a lot.</p>

<p>Pull all the pages together and determine how you are different. We are unlike Company who does stuff because we do otherstuff. Everyone should differentiate themselves from the competitors at every chance.</p>

<p>Us vs. Them Mission Statements. Missions can talk about the company or talk about what the company can do for customers.</p>

<p>Take the time to do it right. Its a great team building experience. And you can reuse the bits and pieces for other efforts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Still in the panel</p>

<p>Jeff - Goldman Sachs; Dave - Mahler, Nixon, and Williams; Alan - Comerica; Betty - Krause Taylor Associates; Mark - Heller Ehrman Venture Law Group</p>

<p>Mark talking about finding a lawyer, everyone specializes in certain areas. You are going to have to work with multiple people. You can expect your lawyer to make introductions (for funding for example). Work with someone who has been through the process before, multiple startups, and that person can find you the people that you need. Find someone who can tap into the community.</p>

<p>Guy says as you&#8217;re seeking a funding advisor you should ask if they&#8217;ve got contacts to find funding.</p>

<p>Q - What can you do to find good board members, what makes a good board member?</p>

<p>Alan - used the example of retired people from within your domain. Says that he needs to make multiple refferals so that they don&#8217;t get into legal trouble, so you should have a bunch to choose from.</p>

<p>Dave - Sarbanes Oxley sya you need a financial advisor on the board.</p>

<p>Jeff - early on boards are different than later. Investors vey active early on, but as you become more mature you need stricter controls and need to transform your board as necessary (without sacrificing the guidance)</p>

<p>Mark - Expertise, expertise, expertise, and objectivity. Make that dream list and try for it, even if you know you won&#8217;t make all of them. Find the person who will ask hard questions.</p>

<p>Guy - what is the max you would offer the Perfect board member?</p>

<p>Mark - it depends on what stages this person is involved in. If the person can only spend two days a month, its valuable but not the same as someone who can spend time to be part of the team. Someone who is part of the team is VERY valuable. Don&#8217;t get caught up in percentages.</p>

<p>Betty - Look at your customer base and then go looking for advisors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Adams, Dave Anderson, Alan Jepsen, Betty Taylor, Mark Weeks.</p>

<p>Panel on creating an ecosystem.</p>

<p>Q - what is the current atmosphere?</p>

<p>Mark - not expecting another bubble, but the startup environment is great, there are lots of exciting ideas and people around these days. Become crisp and to the point.</p>

<p>Betty - Resembles 1998, there is a lot of progress based on where things were 2 years ago. Lots more seasoned management, and they&#8217;ve defined goals well. Google brought in good management, others are doing similar.</p>

<p>Alan - no bubble shortly. Entrapreneurs see problems out there still, but don&#8217;t have money to go after it. Frusterating. Thinks the bubble will never return (not in his lifetime)</p>

<p>Dave - people are using les to do more. Value for the dollar. Look at cedentials of services firms to make sure you&#8221;re getting what you need.</p>

<p>Jeff - This is a great time, opportunity for people to open their wallets is getting better. Lots of tallent to draw from. Great pool to form a company. IPO market is healthy, so that means a better liquidity path. Minimum configuration for a startup; something that people can be pasionate about, good size, profitable for year, seasoned management, financial controls (big emphasis on that))</p>

<p>Mark says we should differentiate the early stage startup from later stage. The early startup doesn&#8217;t need experience, they need passion. At the early stage you really need to find soulmates. (people make spreadsheets about billion dollar markets, but when you drill down can&#8217;t justify it), find people from other areas to help out.</p>

<p>Q - How does an entrapreneur pick a professional w/ your background?</p>

<p>Betty - when you select a PR firm look at their track record, and find out exactly who you are going to be working with. Get some references and then check them, to make sure their contacts are valid. What the firm brings to the table is access.</p>

<p>Alan - picking a bank, find a bank which is interested in emerging companies, one that can make connections for you.</p>

<p>Dave - need a relationship that will grow with the company. Partnerships can really help there. Sarbanes Oxley probably does not apply to the garage startup, but once you have a board you need to start worrying.</p>

<p>Jeff - finding an investment bank, just execute on your vision and Wall Street will find you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Art of Starting - Guy</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the name of his new book.</p>

<p>People came in from out of the country (lots of people from Canada).</p>

<p>The cover of his book is a stock photo from an online service.</p>

<p>He likes to use the top ten format, cause it gives the audience an idea of how long you&#8217;ll suck for.</p>

<p>But he has a top 5 this time, there aren&#8217;t ten principles for starting.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make meaning : not money, money is an outcome of making meaning (preserve something good, right a wrong, etc). During his Apple stint he didn&#8217;t hold to this principle, but he&#8217;s learned it over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Make mantra : simpler than a mission statement. So that if you ask anyone what the company does, they know IMMEDIATELY. Group design of the mission statement sucks, it ends up just being a flimsy woordy statement that no one remembers. Everyone uses the same kind of words. Not worth it for a small company, make a mantra.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Disney - fun family entertainment</p></li>
<li><p>Nike - authentic athletic experience</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Get going : the key is not slides and word, it&#8217;s actually getting going. Think Big. Think 10x better, thing creating a new curve. Jump to a completely new curve. Find soulmates. There is a myth around sole entrapreneur. You should want to plorize people, the worst thing is indifference. You want people to either love it or hate it. Design different. &#8220;I want one&#8221; is one alternative. &#8220;My employer counldnt/wouldnt&#8221;. &#8220;What the hell, it&#8217;s possible, lets build it&#8221; - like Motorola with cell phones. &#8220;There must be a better way&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a business model : He wants just one more bubble, but if that bubble doesn&#8217;t appear you need a business model. &#8220;Who has you money in their pocket, and how do you get it&#8221;. Have a very exact and simple plan. Copy someone elses model. Ask women what they think about your business model. Men have killing coded into their DNA, and men will always say it sounds good. If they really think its a bad idea, they see it as a great way to kill the competition.</p></li>
<li><p>Weave a MAT : starting a company is very much like a blasting site, the MAT keeps debris in. M Milestones, proof of concept, comple design, prototype, ship testable version. A Assumptions - test your assumptions in realtime (performance of product, test market size, how many sales call can a person make, what is the conversion rate, what num of support calls, prices of parts and supplies). T Tasks - major tasks necessary to hit milestones (renting office space, find key vendors, payroll, legal docs, insurance policies)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That is the art of the start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried to use the TMobile interface for using AOL Instant Messenger from my mobile phone the other day, and it didn&#8217;t quite work out the way that I had hoped. In the past I probably would have gone off on a rant about it. But now that I have an unlimited data account, and because the AIM interface is a free feature, I&#8217;m not going to do that. Instead I&#8217;m going to say that it&#8217;s pretty cool of TMobile to try to integrate their online services with existing offerings. They just have some work to do before the service is generally applicable. There are a few quirks and limitations that make the service hard to use and impractical if the people you&#8217;re talking to don&#8217;t know to modify their behavior to account for the interface you&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>The first issue is the most grievous offense actually. Once you sign on to the service it notifies you of new messages via WAP push. This is actually pretty crappy of them, because push messages are NOT a limitless resource, at least I don&#8217;t think so. I won&#8217;t rant about that right now, cause first I want to validate this suspicion about the cost. However, even without the cost factor, this was really annoying and a hindrance to using the service. There was no way to turn off these messages that I was able to find. And each time a new message came it interferes with whatever you&#8217;re doing. You have to acknowledge the message in an asynchronous pop-up screen. This really sucked when the person I was talking to wrote a bunch of really short messages like:</p>

<p>Hey, you there?
I have a meeting soon.
I have to go now.
See you soon.</p>

<p>Which generated 4 separate messages that came in right on top of each other, and were disruptive enough that I couldn&#8217;t get a response in at all before it was too late. Why the WAP pushes? <a href="http://winksite.com/">WINKsite</a> does its group chat using an automatically refreshed page. That&#8217;s really worked out well on just about every device I&#8217;ve tried it from.</p>

<p>The conversations page also seems to only display new messages when you load it. That means that if you&#8217;re reading messages from a conversation, and you accept a WAP push of a new message, the page you end up at no longer holds the text you were just reading. That sucks IMO. If you want to draw attention to newest messages then reverse the order in which the messages are displayed (newest messages at the top) and maybe put a marker next to the new lines. Displaying only the new messages takes all of the context out of what should be a nice flow of conversation. That gets confusing enough when you have a single conversation that keeps you bouncing back and forth between WAP push notification screens and the browser. It&#8217;s almost impossible if you have multiple conversations going on.</p>

<p>The last one might have been user error, but it was user error caused by multiple issues with the features as implemented. It seems like the scrollback buffer is only a few lines long. When I logged in at one point I started a conversation with my girlfriend. I said hello, and that I was on the train on my way back from a meeting. This triggered a torrent of messages. Not at all out of the realm of normal use. The reason for using IM is to keep in touch, right? And she had some news. So she wrote a message and I got the push, which I accepted. While I&#8217;m waiting for the browser to load, I get another message. Bing, bing bing bing. This goes on for maybe a half dozen messages, I lost count. Finally I have a browser sitting in front of me with what are obviously messages from the middle of a long story she&#8217;s telling. I don&#8217;t have the start of the story, and the WAP messages are binging in so quickly that I can&#8217;t get a message back to her to say that I missed the start of her story. That really sucked.</p>

<p>So, the obvious programmer answer to this is to just not talk to people who send torrents of messages like that. But I would really like to see mobile services reach mass appeal. And while TMobile has made a good effort in terms of providing a service to make the mobile experience more continuous with the online experience, it doesn&#8217;t quite make it to the level it needs for general usage. It just isn&#8217;t realistic to expect every user to work out some way to let the people that they talk to know that they&#8217;re on a mobile phone when they login. And if the service really is supposed to unify desktop and mobile messaging it needs to enable the same operations or provide some mechanism for dealing with the differences easily (hopefully automatically). Some of the issues seem to just require minor tweaks. Keep old messages on the conversation screen, reverse the display order so that the newest messages are at the top, and provide a config option to disable WAP push and make the conversations page automatically update.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the persistent features of the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=278">user programmable systems</a> I was blabbing about yesterday is visual programming. The idea here is that users have pictograms that they can move around on the screen and connect to each other. Each symbol on the screen represents one of the software components in the system and/or some transformation to apply. This is the second time in the last few months that visual programming has come to mind. Last time was when I was fooling around with Scheme and realized that there seems to be a much more natural mapping for functional languages to move to visual composition. Visual programming is another of those areas that seems really simple when we talk about it, but must have some really thorny problems that have yet to get sorted. It&#8217;s an area that I don&#8217;t have very much experience with in general.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s come up a few times recently, and I have another project going on that involves graphing and diagramming functionality in general (not fronting for executable logic), so I figured I would dig around a little bit. The <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/vpl.html">Visual Language Research Bibliography</a> seems to be a great way to do that. I was interested to see that there was some <a href="http://www.iks.inf.ethz.ch/publications/bio03v.html">work related directly to visual composition of web services</a>. Not that it really changes anything today, but it is an interesting thought experiment along the lines of &#8220;how do I access the functions I want from my handset&#8221;. Not that I would expect users to be able to (or want to!!) draw little pictures on their phone in order to interact with data and communicate with friends. But it does seem like a solution to one would complement the other. Coming up with a way to segment services such that they could be presented on a pure visual interface while retaining enough expressive power to solve complex problems seems like it would get you a long way toward coming up with an interface to operations that would be usable from a mobile device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been taking some time to try to step back a bit and consider the role of technology as a whole. Already a pretty popular topic, many of the currently popular bloggers mix politics, sociology, psychology, and technology into their own editorials. But I&#8217;m not taking quite that big of a step back. I&#8217;m thinking more in terms of the overall productivity that technology brings. I find it very easy to fall into the trap of striving for a technical hack for no reason. When I see a problem sometimes I just want to solve it. Probably a pretty healthy overall attitude, but like anything too much is bad thing. So I have a bunch of toys now: a good hosting plan for my main site so I can run what I want, a PDA with bluetooth and 802.11 interfaces, a new cell phone, a GPRS plan with no data limit. So it was time to take a deep breath and think about what that means instead of just running off in search of the next gadget.</p>

<p>I use my phone for the standard SMS usages, mostly coordination of meetings with people and notifications. I use it for work a decent amount, just to let someone know what the status is if IM isn&#8217;t an option. I also use it for small reminders to myself however. Over the last few months I&#8217;ve really started to &#8220;live out of my inbox&#8221;, which is one of the phrases used to describe the common condition of organizing work based on the email in your inbox. I could just take a note on my phone, or put a todo item in my PDA, but I&#8217;ve found it much more convenient to be able to insert that message right into the place where I know I&#8217;ll be able to manage it. The service I have provides a special number that I can send an SMS to, but which then delivers the message to an email address. Very convenient for when a quick idea strikes. Something I would like to do, but haven&#8217;t done yet, is setting up filters on my mail server to SMS me a message when someone from my address book sends me an email. This is something that the Blackberry devices do well. They deliver a message to the device asynchronously whenever there&#8217;s a new email. The mix I have doesn&#8217;t support that directly, but it&#8217;s something I can hack together.</p>

<p>My address book is becoming more and more important as well. For me, the &#8220;official&#8221; version is the one on my PDA. I would like to be able to sync that information around easily.. but even after all these years bluetooth doesn&#8217;t deliver in this regard. If I send my address book from my Clie to my T610 some fields end up in the wrong places, and there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a sync (just a send). So I&#8217;ll have to spend some time trying out a tool like <a href="http://multisync.sourceforge.net/">MultiSync</a> to see if I can get a sync between the devices working. I won&#8217;t bother complaining about the need to involve a third device in that transaction.</p>

<p>These are all little bits of detail however. What I would really like to be able to do is take an overall look at my practice of information management. I&#8217;ve described some pieces of what I would like to be a much more unified technique for moving my information around. One of the major issues standing in the way of a fluid set of interactions with my information is the lack of ad-hoc reconfiguration that software provides. We&#8217;ve been hearing for a long time that the world of user programmable systems is just around the corner. The ultimate vision is that computer software systems will consist of easily pluggable components which even the most casual user can assemble into the software that they want. No one has been able to deliver on that architecture however. One of the latest incarnations of the vision seems to be within enterprise computing, where a technology called web services and an associated paradigm called service oriented architecture are currently all the rage. However, I&#8217;m interested in the problem all the way at the other end of the scale of computing. How can services be provided in a generic way such that online and offline information can be blended, and that I can access the information that I want and perform the actions that I need to both from my PC and from my phone or PDA? It&#8217;s a tough question.</p>

<p>Some of the examples that I find the most appealing come from pretty much the same arena, they&#8217;re chat based services. The first are IRC bots. These are programs that connect to the IRC network and listen for commands sent to them using the same mechanisms that an IRC user would use to communicate with any other IRC user. The second are applications built on top of instant messaging frameworks, in particular <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>. In both cases a user can interact with the program in the same way that they communicate with friends and colleagues. But that can&#8217;t be the only difference. If that were the only important characteristic then systems like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">Mailman</a> would fall into the same bucket. I think it&#8217;s probably important that the chat based programs act very much like bridges into other systems. Many bots have functions such as performing lookups on websites, tracking when users last logged in and storing some profile information about them, keeping common definitions and references, and notifications about external events (one example of this would be <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pastebot/">pastebot</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, they&#8217;re really just hacks to allow this external information to be accessed using chat as the medium. What should the medium of access be in the ideal system? How should the subsystems interface? What should the user see while assembling their components?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I agree with the <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007851.html">response that Russell Beattie</a> has to a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5092826/site/newsweek/">recent article in Newsweek</a>. Although there are some points that I disagree about. I do agree that asking Palm about the future of mobile devices is awfully one sided. Although from what I&#8217;ve read, Jeff Hawkins is a stunningly smart guy with a great grip on technology, I do think the wireless mobile vision of PalmOne is seriously suspect. Jeff might be able to help out there, but their track record is far from stunning when it comes to network devices. I do agree with Russ that Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, etc. are probably better places to look. However, I think this is one of those often sprung technologist pitfalls. Having the better technology, and being of more use to the user, isn&#8217;t a sure recipe for success. Yes, Palm does have a proprietary operating system, and just about any platform technology besides PalmOS looks like a good alternative to the developer. However, what does the standard user see? I&#8217;m not sure that the better technology of Motorola and Nokia within the mobile space is going to be enough to overcome the brand recognition and existing sales channels that Palm has. I would LIKE it to, I&#8217;m just not sure it&#8217;s going to happen. When it comes to the average user, they need to be sold on the package as it exists when it comes to them. They don&#8217;t and probably never will care about the platform. Even though the choice will seriously impact them somewhere down the line.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Microsoft empire. Many users are unhappy about the current state of the market, but at the end they have no one to blame but themselves. The users put Microsoft in a certain position within their technology profile, and now they have to deal with it. I think that it&#8217;s entirely possible for the same kind of thing to happen in this market. Non-proprietary platforms and extensibility don&#8217;t mean crap if someone else can get a good enough product in front of the user in a functional form at the right time. So although Russ says that it&#8217;s a badly written and badly researched article, I would kindly disagree. I think it&#8217;s a wakeup call of the other smartphone manufacturers to get off their asses and start building some brand recognition with the user audience. They&#8217;ve done a good job with the developers, but you can&#8217;t count on the techies to carry your message out to the people. You have to bring it there on your own. Don&#8217;t count on the cellular service providers to sell your handsets by selling users on data service. Providers can&#8217;t do it, especially not here in the US. The cellular service providers just don&#8217;t get mobile applications, as astounding as that may seem. If you have a mobile data device you are going to have to sell the users on it yourself.</p>
