  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve registered myself for <a href="http://www.artofthestart.com/">The Art of the Start</a>, a day long event by <a href="http://www.garage.com/">Garage Technology Ventures</a> focused on educating entrepreneurs about successfully starting a company. A friend pointed out that if you&#8217;re an <a href="http://www.sdforum.org">SDForum</a> member you can get fifty dollars off on the registration. You just need to call up SDForum and get the promotion code to use, they have info on the <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/Level1.aspx?pid=10080&amp;sid=7">Special Offers</a> page. If you&#8217;re planning to be over there, drop me a line and we&#8217;ll meet up. I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be somewhat out of my element, but that&#8217;s fine.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going after all. I would eventually like to start up an entrepreneurial venture of my own and I know there&#8217;s a lot I still don&#8217;t know. Even though I&#8217;ve technically only been consulting on my own for a few months, I&#8217;ve met some very interesting people and run across some great ideas. It takes a whole lot more than just a good idea to start up a successful company however. Some people seem to be able to do it without thinking, others have to work at it to be able to see all the angles. I know I&#8217;m in the latter category. I&#8217;m just trying to front load as much of the work as I can, so that I&#8217;m not learning everything on the job later on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve added a link to the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">link blog</a> up at the top of the standard view of this blog. I&#8217;ve been using it quite a bit again, cause it&#8217;s a convenient way to keep track of stuff I want to read without bookmarking it at whatever computer I happen to be at (probably not the same computer that I&#8217;ll be at later when I want to retrieve that bookmark). My link blog has the extra attribute of concentrating on links which render well on small screens - the stuff I chuck there is meant to be pulled up on my Palm for later reading. It&#8217;s actually a pretty decent set of reading in small-screen-friendly format.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s really more of a proof of concept than a first version, which is why I&#8217;ve given it the release number 0.1, but I have an app that I&#8217;ve successfully used to post Atom from a Palm device. I was feeling really creative, so I named it <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/palmatom/">PalmAtom</a>. It does lots of things wrong, but I&#8217;ve decided to release it anyway. There&#8217;s this credo of &#8220;release early, release often&#8221; that runs through open source in general. Problem is, developing for the Palm can be a real pain, so Palm projects don&#8217;t get all that much contribution. Palm doesn&#8217;t seem to really care for open source developers these days either, which has made some of the few remaining ones less than pleasant to deal with. But Treos are turning up all over the place here in the US, so I figured this might make for an interesting tool. I really do think this whole shift in media consumption style and production techniques is pretty important, as I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=269">mentioned the other day</a>. And I do want to do something about it. I also happen to have this belief that these poor wireless and handheld devices currently available are second class citizens at best. So I&#8217;m trying to figure out what I can do to move the media revolution out of the office and into the streets.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a user ready application by any means. I would recommend picking it up if you want to hack on it, or maybe if you want an example in C of how to do Atom authentication, but not if you&#8217;re a normal user looking for an application to post with. Not yet. Still, I was pretty happy about being able to hack the thing together in just a few hours. I ripped the SHA1 code out of <a href="http://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net/">Keyring for Palm OS</a>, base64 is a public domain implementation taken from <a href="http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/">xmlrpc-epi</a>, and the http stuff is a <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/PalmHTTP/">library I released a while ago</a>. Not too shabby. Course, I&#8217;ve spent a while mucking around with an Atom example in Python, so I was pretty familiar with what I had to do. Hopefully over the next few weeks I&#8217;ll have time to clean up the implementation and make it somewhat user friendly. Even more hopefully, some people out there in wonderland will send me some patches so I don&#8217;t have to write all the crud myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went over to the <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/DevelopersSalon">Technorati Developers Salon</a> on Wed, but I haven&#8217;t really had much time to sit down and write something since then. People have already posted much of the information from the event. In particular I point to the info from xian, an excellent three part post that seems to have come out in realtime:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://radiofreeblogistan.com/2004/05/19/blogging_from_hunters_point.html">part 1</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://radiofreeblogistan.com/2004/05/20/more_notes_from_technorati_salon.html">part 2</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://radiofreeblogistan.com/2004/05/20/technorati_developers_brainstorm.html">part 3</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>There was certainly a lot of good geekiness going on, and while the technology discussion was important I think it&#8217;s been covered pretty well. So instead I&#8217;ll comment on some of the other factors of the meeting. I was talking with someone there about how it&#8217;s just not possible to catch the full content of a physical meeting like this for online consumption. Maybe I can help out a bit, fill in some of the background and give some of the details that aren&#8217;t really related to the geek end of things. Although I am interested in the Technorati API somewhat, I&#8217;m more interested in the general usefulness of tools for information exchange. Technorati is quickly becoming one of the staples of online discussion tracking, so I think it should probably be of interest to a lot more people than it already is.</p>

<p>I should probably start with the basics. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/faq.html">FAQ at the Technorati site</a>, but I know I don&#8217;t normally find FAQs all that useful unless I have a specific bit of info I&#8217;m going after. So instead let me start with an example of Technorati usage. I normally think of the URL based search first. Go to the <a href="http://www.technorati.com">front page of Technorati</a> and you&#8217;ll see a search box. If you enter a URL into that search box you&#8217;ll get a listing of blogs which link to that URL. For example, I enter the URL http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog to see who&#8217;s linking to my blog. The result is a <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitsplitter.net%2Fblog%2F&amp;sub=Go%21">page like this</a>. As you can hopefully see from that, there&#8217;s a list of pages that have links to my blog. Some are people who have me on their blogroll, others have linked to posts. This is part of what people mean when they say Technorati can be used to track conversations. Say someone posts something to their blog which references a post of mine. If they posted a trackback, my blog software tells me about it. But if they haven&#8217;t used a trackback, I normally find out about their post because I see it as an incoming link to my blog. It allows me to find out when people are picking up the topics I&#8217;ve introduced, without having to read through every blog to do so (an impossible proposition at this point, there are just too many blogs). According to what Dave said, this was really the initial motivation for Technorati. He had a blog of his own, and he wanted to know who was linking to the things he said. There are other ways to get notified when people link to your posts (trackback is one, I&#8217;ll have to cover that another time), but nothing is as reliable as Technorati yet.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t have to be the URL of an entire blog or site that you search for. If I wanted to know who had linked to part 1 of the posts by xian that I listed above I could enter in the URL for that one post. The result is <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fradiofreeblogistan.com%2F2004%2F05%2F19%2Fblogging_from_hunters_point.html&amp;sub=Go%21">this page</a>, which lists posts that link to just that one entry. Much more convenient than searching through the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fradiofreeblogistan.com%2F&amp;sub=Go%21">hundreds of links to Radio Free Blogistan</a> to find the conversations that I&#8217;m interested in. Note however that both operations are significant. Maybe I want just one conversation, or maybe I&#8217;m looking for more information sources and I want to find a general list of people who also point to Radio Free Blogistan. Casual users normally don&#8217;t know how to pick the right URL to put into the search in order to pull up the results they want. So some bloggers have started putting links into their post templates that can be used to retrieve the Technorati listing for a single post. See <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave&#8217;s alerts</a> for an example. Those links that say &#8220;Other blogs commenting on this post&#8221; pull up the search results for just that single post. It seems like a minor point if you&#8217;re a geek and understand how it all works. But is one of those steps along the path of turning a web site into a service.</p>

<p>Sure, Technorati is a web site that you can go to and type queries into. However, it&#8217;s also a set of service URLs which you can link directly from your own blog or website in order to provide your readers with up to date info. The service nature of Technorati goes deeper than this actually. They provide an API that developers can use, which in general gives very granular control of requests to Technorati. This lets developers of other websites tie in to Technorati and provide new applications without having to ask Technorati for new features. One of the recent updates is that their HTML website (the site you see when you go to <a href="http://www.technorati.com">the front page</a> and click on stuff) is actually just a thin layer of cover over the base API that they expose for developers. In the software industry this is called &#8220;eating your own dogfood&#8221;, which is applied in general to any set of developers using the tools they develop as part of their daily work. This normally leads to higher quality output because the feedback loop can have zero hops. Developers are users, so they&#8217;ll often find problems and omissions very quickly. Having this API available means that if there&#8217;s something you think the Technorati site should do that it doesn&#8217;t, you should be able to write a version that performs the way you would like it to. Assuming you know how to develop web services based applications, and that the API supports getting the information that you want. And that&#8217;s really what the final part of the Salon was about. What features should be added to the API so that developers can develop some cool new applications? A lot of the points you see listed in the other posts about the salon focus on this kind of enhancement. There was also talk about how to create a situation where Technorati either has more information that it can parse out of existing posts, or where posts can be formated in a way that allows greater information extraction. It boils down to the same thing for general usage, the more information that goes into Technorati, the more a user can expect to be able to get the services to do for them.</p>

<p>The discussion kept cycling back to the question of how Technorati plans to make money. The question is still unresolved, but they mentioned advertising and subscription services as possible sources of income. I don&#8217;t want to really delve into those details too much, I just want to point out one potential business usage of Technorati. The URL that you search for doesn&#8217;t have to be the URL of a blog or a post. If I want to know what people out in the blogosphere are saying about my company, I can just search for <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitsplitter.net&amp;sub=Go%21">anyone linking to anything on the Bitsplitter site</a>. There&#8217;s not that much there for my company, most of that stuff is related to my blog. But just take a look at something like the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com&amp;sub=Go%21">inbound links for IBM</a>. Information about what people are saying about a company like this can be quite valuable. Not only because it comes in so fresh, but because it gives them an extra degree of tracking they can do. Say IBM launches a new <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/">alphaWorks</a> project and after a month suddenly sees a stampede of traffic. They can use Technorati as one factor in figuring out why it is that so many people suddenly found the site. Or even better, Technorati could alert IBM of the new postings before the stampede of traffic arrives. Of course, if you&#8217;re IBM you can always have some of your army of consultants write something that parses referrer logs to figure out after the fact where the traffic came from. But if you want that alert in advance Technorati is the best way to get it. And there could be other analysis and stats reports to go along with the alerting service. The stuff is still all up in the air of course, but I mention it because you can use the interface as it is today to check out what people are saying about your business. If you&#8217;re thinking about setting up a blog for your business you can use Technorati to check out how much extra buzz it&#8217;s generating.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just a tool for geeks. Especially with the much more participatory nature of &#8220;the media&#8221; in general, it seems to be serving a critical role in gathering information about how your message is making it out into the public. No matter if your message is a technical discussion of how Atom requests should work or information about a new product release. So, that being said, I was kinda disappointed about the turnout. There were a lot of people there, to be sure. And the collective technical street cred of the room was well up at the high end of the scale, even for a Silicon Valley event. But I really do think this is something that hordes of people should be interested in (and maybe are interested in, but don&#8217;t know that Technorati provides what they&#8217;re looking for). I think Dave and company are doing a great job in serving the developer community. Everything about the way that they ran the salon just gave me a good impression. If you&#8217;ve read about creative destruction and want to see what it looks like in practice, come to the next salon and witness it for yourself. One possible take on the situation is that Technorati is really concentrating on enabling developers so that the developer applications provide the pull for the end users. That&#8217;s a happy place to be, and I think it jives with what I&#8217;ve seen. However, I also know that geeks aren&#8217;t always very good at creating applications which apply to and can be used by the average user. It doesn&#8217;t have to be like this of course, it just works out that experienced users and developers are frequently blind to issues that cripple normal users. I would really like to see services like this proliferate. Especially after seeing Dan Gillmor speak last night about <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1380&amp;mo=5&amp;yr=2004">We The Media</a>, a mass media structured not like a lecture but like a conversation, I think tools like this are essential. However they aren&#8217;t immediately available to the people who would like to use them. So I&#8217;ve been trying to think of applications which would enhance the impact of the decentralization of news. Apps that provide stats tracking, and detailed mapping of blog interactions are great geek tools. They&#8217;re essential for the top-down study of what&#8217;s going on. But what can we build to help news move from the edge inward, from the bottom-up? I&#8217;m not smart enough to have a good answer to that yet. Hopefully I will at some point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After two and a half weeks on the road I&#8217;m finally back in California. Of course the best way to really feel that I&#8217;ve come back home is to get into something geeky. So I walked into the door to my apartment, downloaded a map to my Clie, took a shower, and zipped right off to the Technorati Developers Salon. I&#8217;ll have to make up a separate entry for that later on, it was a good session. On my way back I was standing at the BART station on 22nd and I saw another guy with a laptop bag, so I asked if he coming from the salon also. He wasn&#8217;t, but he knew what I was talking about, so we chatted for a bit while the train came. Ahh, to be back in the Bay Area, where discussions with random strangers can revolve around the future of the Technorati API. I know the dangers involved in being surrounded by people who already know what you&#8217;re talking about all the time. Especially as a business person, it&#8217;s dangerous to never hear the objections that a complete newbie has. When everyone else you run across knows the principles you&#8217;re building on, it&#8217;s much easier for them to accept your pitch and understand the value you&#8217;re presenting. But after a long period of full immersion in the biomass it is nice to have a couple of conversations that start at geeky and quickly get more abstract.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a very interesting <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/archives/2004_05_01_smallbusinesses_archive.html#108429282193469092">post about the correlation between R&D; spending and profitability</a>. The post points to <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/resilience/rr00007?pg=all">a great article at strategy+business</a>. I don&#8217;t think the news that businesses are moving from a &#8220;closed&#8221; innovation cycle (all work done within the company) to an &#8220;open&#8221; innovation cycle (where ideas in particular are pulled from outside) is very surprising. The general movement towards business models where free agents play a large role certainly seems to fit together well with the shift. I do take issue with one bit however. It relates to the innovation effectiveness curve and this bit from the text:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our recent work has shown that incremental innovation investments are subject to diminishing returns &#8211; in other words, each additional dollar spent on new product development ultimately yields a lower and lower return. This observation passes the test of common sense: Spending beyond a certain point on any development portfolio should result in lower returns, &#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the statement in general, but that curve as illustrated ignores the &#8220;beyond a certain point&#8221; part of the statement. That curve seems to show what happens if companies overspend on innovation, charting how effectiveness falls off if the company overspends. What about underspending? I would assume that effectiveness also falls off in that direction.</p>

<p>I assume that the authors aren&#8217;t saying that zero spending on new product development is the way to go. It&#8217;s probably their response to previous suggestions that companies should be spending a lot more on R&D; which has shifted the focus down the line to overspending. For most of the companies I&#8217;ve worked with, overspending on product development is not the major issue. Granted, most of the companies I work with are smaller organizations, and the examples given in the article seem to be tilted towards larger companies. But I still want to say that in general the challenge to small companies that I&#8217;ve seen most often is hitting the right level of innovation. For startup companies the error seems most often to be too much stress on innovation. They plan big elaborate products and services, burn too much of their capital, and don&#8217;t have enough time or money left for the course corrections they inevitably need down the line. However, as soon as a company has a product out they tend to swing quickly back the other way. They become quickly focused on their existing customers and product lines, and tend to react negatively to any new idea they didn&#8217;t generate themselves.</p>

<p>For a small company just starting out I think there is an opportunity to adjust the maximal level of innovation payoff. Not many of the companies I&#8217;ve worked with have attempted to plan their business development along this line. For a startup company it can seem ridiculous to attempt to plan for the level of innovation they want to achieve when they don&#8217;t yet have a first product. But the rate of innovation within a company is one of the major influences on the overall tempo of the business, and once the beat is set it usually gets more difficult to change as time goes on. The discussion about the innovation curve from the article says that the innovation curve for a company normally does not change. I agree, but I think that it can change. If a company is looking to alter the way it innovates they can change that curve, but just throwing money at R&D; is not going to do it. The company needs to look at alternatives like creating internal marketplaces for ideas and tying together the different stages of the innovation cycle so that divergent ideas from all areas of the business (and outside the business) can be captured and explored. I think the reason that the innovation curve doesn&#8217;t move is because so few concentrate on moving it. I think that finding the point of maximal payback and  making an effort to make that point correspond with the desired maximum is a necessary precursor to tuning performance along that curve.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I do think that the comment from David Patterson is perfect:</p>

<blockquote><p>If they are right, and if Godin&#8217;s concept of what really constitutes viable innovation holds water, then small businesses can look forward to new and increased markets for their ability to innovate quickly.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with that completely. It can be tricky trying to fit within the innovation cycle however. I&#8217;ve certainly found that to be true within my industry of choice, and I&#8217;m assuming it applies to others as well. Relationships in general have to be closer. Being engaged during the innovation cycle doesn&#8217;t mean just getting a technical specification and wandering off to implement it. Many companies are looking for someone to help them think through the process as they execute it. There needs to be a lot of dialog between the parties, occurring on a number of different levels. This can be tricky to establish at first, or it has been for me at least. A company wants a new product, they want it as soon as possible, and they&#8217;re groping around for help. The temptation for me is to attempt to give them answers. However I&#8217;ve found that the right course is normally to start a conversation. Once the dialog has started the result is normally a plan which blends outside insight with hard won internal skills and core competencies. The &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome is pretty easy to beat if you can come at it from the right angle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just posted about Sem@code, which I think rocks. Since I&#8217;ve said so much good, I feel somewhat justified in bringing up <a href="http://wireless.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=23921">this article about RFID and cell phones</a>. I can think of no appropriate words, except perhaps &#8220;steaming load of crap&#8221;. Take the quote from the article used in the post leader:</p>

<blockquote><p>What if that same salesman could hit a few buttons on the car&#8217;s dashboard and have the information sent back to those applications via cell phone? Think how happy he would be to arrive home after a trip to find an accurate expense check already in the in-box.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ummm.. how does RFID fit into that? I&#8217;m not sure. Maybe something get left out of that point, mistakes happen. But unfotunately everything there is just complete and total bunk. RFID adoption is getting driven completely by requirements from WalMart and the DOD. Very few people <strong>wanted</strong> to invest in the technology, they were strongarmed into adopting it. Where do all these happy RFID boosters come from? Mostly RFID consultants, people selling the tech and the services, making to look a quick buck at someone else&#8217;s expense. What happens when a technology get forced into a place without the proper amount of gestation and natural selection in the marketplace? You end up with fragile systems that cost more to maintain than they save. WalMart might save money by using RFID, the DOD might. None of their suppliers are going to save money, it&#8217;s an additional cost of doing business for them.</p>

<p>So why do I want to use RFID from my cell phone? I DO think it&#8217;s a good idea. I would like to be able to identify items using my handset, and involve real world objects in data transactions. I just think this article does a terrible job of describing why one would want to do those things. I&#8217;m surprized it got picked up in so many of the news sources that I read. And, really, it disappoints me. Makes me think that people are out there shillin&#8217; for the Technology Man.. as I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=261">recently mentioned</a>. What&#8217;s the deal? Someone, please explain what about that article even bordered on competent. Comments are open.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://semacode.org/">Sem@code</a> project has released a <a href="http://semacode.org/download/">demo for Symbian phones</a>. I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=20">posted about it at the end of last year</a>, and I still think it&#8217;s a great idea. I actually exchanged a few emails with Simon, trying to find out what he had planned for it. He&#8217;s interested in trying to make money off the idea, which is certainly a good idea. I was hoping he would be releasing the code under some kind of dual license model (ie. GPL for non-commercial use, like what <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/licensing/">MySQL has done</a>), and that&#8217;s probably still possible. Interest in the project always helps of course, so this is my post to try to help out the project so that Simon can make some money off of it and hopefully make more of this excellent idea publicly available.</p>

<p>The question I&#8217;ll answer: &#8220;So, what&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221;. Why is it important that people can scan URLs into their phone?</p>

<p>The first part of course is convenience. We could of course put these urls onto stickers and just have people type them in. But even the small URLs that come out of services like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> can be a pain to type in on a numeric keypad. People will not use services that are not convenient unless the the benefit is high enough. So by making the URL easier to get into the phone, we make it more convenient to the user, and lower the payoff that the user has to expect in order to use the service. The user might not want to type in a URL on an advertisement to find out what bands are playing at a local bar, but if they just have to point their camera and press a button they are willing to take a look. Sem@code is a service enabler implemented in software. Existing handsets designs can be used, but the new software increases the range of services the user will access. An inconvenient barrier has been removed.</p>

<p>The other major benefit is that anyone can create the Sem@codes, encoding whatever URL they want. This enables <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=201">public authoring</a> without requiring infrastructure on the service provider side. I think this is one of the persistent barriers to new services getting developed. Most location based services require the cooperation of handset manufacturers or service providers, neither of whom is very willing to try out new ideas until they know that they&#8217;ll be able to make a profit. And of course users aren&#8217;t willing to pay more for service or devices unless there are applications. The end result is that progress happens pretty slowly, and normally it ends up being small jumps from where we&#8217;ve been before. I personally want completely new apps, new services, new devices, completely and radically new ways of communicating and colaborating. I think lots of mobile computing ethusiasts do as well. Sem@codes allow a way for those interested in deploying location based services to do so completely on their own, without relying on any new technology being deployed or any new handset features. Sem@codes provide a open experimentation space for those interested in location based services, something that can be prototyped and deployed to a select group with very little up front investment. Kick ass. I wish Simon the best of luck with this, it&#8217;s a great concept.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TheFeature has <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100591">Listening to Users, Part III</a> posted. I really like this series of articles. My personal favorite quote from this one:</p>

<blockquote><p>The operators need to let in innovation as the Web has done. If it causes viruses, then that is one of the inevitable consequences of such openness. On the social niceties, all the academic research suggests users can quickly adapt, and users who abused the system would be quickly frozen out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yay!! I&#8217;ve said things like that a bunch of times before. It&#8217;s always nice to find some external validation.</p>
