  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a very interesting <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/archives/2004_05_01_smallbusinesses_archive.html#108429282193469092">post about the correlation between R&D; spending and profitability</a>. The post points to <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/resilience/rr00007?pg=all">a great article at strategy+business</a>. I don&#8217;t think the news that businesses are moving from a &#8220;closed&#8221; innovation cycle (all work done within the company) to an &#8220;open&#8221; innovation cycle (where ideas in particular are pulled from outside) is very surprising. The general movement towards business models where free agents play a large role certainly seems to fit together well with the shift. I do take issue with one bit however. It relates to the innovation effectiveness curve and this bit from the text:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our recent work has shown that incremental innovation investments are subject to diminishing returns &#8211; in other words, each additional dollar spent on new product development ultimately yields a lower and lower return. This observation passes the test of common sense: Spending beyond a certain point on any development portfolio should result in lower returns, &#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the statement in general, but that curve as illustrated ignores the &#8220;beyond a certain point&#8221; part of the statement. That curve seems to show what happens if companies overspend on innovation, charting how effectiveness falls off if the company overspends. What about underspending? I would assume that effectiveness also falls off in that direction.</p>

<p>I assume that the authors aren&#8217;t saying that zero spending on new product development is the way to go. It&#8217;s probably their response to previous suggestions that companies should be spending a lot more on R&D; which has shifted the focus down the line to overspending. For most of the companies I&#8217;ve worked with, overspending on product development is not the major issue. Granted, most of the companies I work with are smaller organizations, and the examples given in the article seem to be tilted towards larger companies. But I still want to say that in general the challenge to small companies that I&#8217;ve seen most often is hitting the right level of innovation. For startup companies the error seems most often to be too much stress on innovation. They plan big elaborate products and services, burn too much of their capital, and don&#8217;t have enough time or money left for the course corrections they inevitably need down the line. However, as soon as a company has a product out they tend to swing quickly back the other way. They become quickly focused on their existing customers and product lines, and tend to react negatively to any new idea they didn&#8217;t generate themselves.</p>

<p>For a small company just starting out I think there is an opportunity to adjust the maximal level of innovation payoff. Not many of the companies I&#8217;ve worked with have attempted to plan their business development along this line. For a startup company it can seem ridiculous to attempt to plan for the level of innovation they want to achieve when they don&#8217;t yet have a first product. But the rate of innovation within a company is one of the major influences on the overall tempo of the business, and once the beat is set it usually gets more difficult to change as time goes on. The discussion about the innovation curve from the article says that the innovation curve for a company normally does not change. I agree, but I think that it can change. If a company is looking to alter the way it innovates they can change that curve, but just throwing money at R&D; is not going to do it. The company needs to look at alternatives like creating internal marketplaces for ideas and tying together the different stages of the innovation cycle so that divergent ideas from all areas of the business (and outside the business) can be captured and explored. I think the reason that the innovation curve doesn&#8217;t move is because so few concentrate on moving it. I think that finding the point of maximal payback and  making an effort to make that point correspond with the desired maximum is a necessary precursor to tuning performance along that curve.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I do think that the comment from David Patterson is perfect:</p>

<blockquote><p>If they are right, and if Godin&#8217;s concept of what really constitutes viable innovation holds water, then small businesses can look forward to new and increased markets for their ability to innovate quickly.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with that completely. It can be tricky trying to fit within the innovation cycle however. I&#8217;ve certainly found that to be true within my industry of choice, and I&#8217;m assuming it applies to others as well. Relationships in general have to be closer. Being engaged during the innovation cycle doesn&#8217;t mean just getting a technical specification and wandering off to implement it. Many companies are looking for someone to help them think through the process as they execute it. There needs to be a lot of dialog between the parties, occurring on a number of different levels. This can be tricky to establish at first, or it has been for me at least. A company wants a new product, they want it as soon as possible, and they&#8217;re groping around for help. The temptation for me is to attempt to give them answers. However I&#8217;ve found that the right course is normally to start a conversation. Once the dialog has started the result is normally a plan which blends outside insight with hard won internal skills and core competencies. The &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome is pretty easy to beat if you can come at it from the right angle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just posted about Sem@code, which I think rocks. Since I&#8217;ve said so much good, I feel somewhat justified in bringing up <a href="http://wireless.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=23921">this article about RFID and cell phones</a>. I can think of no appropriate words, except perhaps &#8220;steaming load of crap&#8221;. Take the quote from the article used in the post leader:</p>

<blockquote><p>What if that same salesman could hit a few buttons on the car&#8217;s dashboard and have the information sent back to those applications via cell phone? Think how happy he would be to arrive home after a trip to find an accurate expense check already in the in-box.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ummm.. how does RFID fit into that? I&#8217;m not sure. Maybe something get left out of that point, mistakes happen. But unfotunately everything there is just complete and total bunk. RFID adoption is getting driven completely by requirements from WalMart and the DOD. Very few people <strong>wanted</strong> to invest in the technology, they were strongarmed into adopting it. Where do all these happy RFID boosters come from? Mostly RFID consultants, people selling the tech and the services, making to look a quick buck at someone else&#8217;s expense. What happens when a technology get forced into a place without the proper amount of gestation and natural selection in the marketplace? You end up with fragile systems that cost more to maintain than they save. WalMart might save money by using RFID, the DOD might. None of their suppliers are going to save money, it&#8217;s an additional cost of doing business for them.</p>

<p>So why do I want to use RFID from my cell phone? I DO think it&#8217;s a good idea. I would like to be able to identify items using my handset, and involve real world objects in data transactions. I just think this article does a terrible job of describing why one would want to do those things. I&#8217;m surprized it got picked up in so many of the news sources that I read. And, really, it disappoints me. Makes me think that people are out there shillin&#8217; for the Technology Man.. as I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=261">recently mentioned</a>. What&#8217;s the deal? Someone, please explain what about that article even bordered on competent. Comments are open.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://semacode.org/">Sem@code</a> project has released a <a href="http://semacode.org/download/">demo for Symbian phones</a>. I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=20">posted about it at the end of last year</a>, and I still think it&#8217;s a great idea. I actually exchanged a few emails with Simon, trying to find out what he had planned for it. He&#8217;s interested in trying to make money off the idea, which is certainly a good idea. I was hoping he would be releasing the code under some kind of dual license model (ie. GPL for non-commercial use, like what <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/licensing/">MySQL has done</a>), and that&#8217;s probably still possible. Interest in the project always helps of course, so this is my post to try to help out the project so that Simon can make some money off of it and hopefully make more of this excellent idea publicly available.</p>

<p>The question I&#8217;ll answer: &#8220;So, what&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221;. Why is it important that people can scan URLs into their phone?</p>

<p>The first part of course is convenience. We could of course put these urls onto stickers and just have people type them in. But even the small URLs that come out of services like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> can be a pain to type in on a numeric keypad. People will not use services that are not convenient unless the the benefit is high enough. So by making the URL easier to get into the phone, we make it more convenient to the user, and lower the payoff that the user has to expect in order to use the service. The user might not want to type in a URL on an advertisement to find out what bands are playing at a local bar, but if they just have to point their camera and press a button they are willing to take a look. Sem@code is a service enabler implemented in software. Existing handsets designs can be used, but the new software increases the range of services the user will access. An inconvenient barrier has been removed.</p>

<p>The other major benefit is that anyone can create the Sem@codes, encoding whatever URL they want. This enables <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=201">public authoring</a> without requiring infrastructure on the service provider side. I think this is one of the persistent barriers to new services getting developed. Most location based services require the cooperation of handset manufacturers or service providers, neither of whom is very willing to try out new ideas until they know that they&#8217;ll be able to make a profit. And of course users aren&#8217;t willing to pay more for service or devices unless there are applications. The end result is that progress happens pretty slowly, and normally it ends up being small jumps from where we&#8217;ve been before. I personally want completely new apps, new services, new devices, completely and radically new ways of communicating and colaborating. I think lots of mobile computing ethusiasts do as well. Sem@codes allow a way for those interested in deploying location based services to do so completely on their own, without relying on any new technology being deployed or any new handset features. Sem@codes provide a open experimentation space for those interested in location based services, something that can be prototyped and deployed to a select group with very little up front investment. Kick ass. I wish Simon the best of luck with this, it&#8217;s a great concept.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TheFeature has <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100591">Listening to Users, Part III</a> posted. I really like this series of articles. My personal favorite quote from this one:</p>

<blockquote><p>The operators need to let in innovation as the Web has done. If it causes viruses, then that is one of the inevitable consequences of such openness. On the social niceties, all the academic research suggests users can quickly adapt, and users who abused the system would be quickly frozen out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yay!! I&#8217;ve said things like that a bunch of times before. It&#8217;s always nice to find some external validation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Technorati is hosting a <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000347.html">Developers Salon Kickoff</a> in San Francisco on May 19th. Although it&#8217;s called a &#8220;developers salon&#8221;, it sounds more like an open invitation to both users and developers to come and talk to the team. I&#8217;m going cause it&#8217;s an interesting tool. I like Technorati, but I haven&#8217;t used any of the <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/">development interfaces</a> yet. It&#8217;s normally a good move from the innovative technology standpoint as well. If you have a product or service that does something genuinely new, something that hasn&#8217;t been tried before, it&#8217;s good to take your developers and your users and partners, get them in the same room, and see what happens. The results can be quite surprising. So, I&#8217;m planning to go to observe the interaction as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471237124.html">The Art of Deception</a>, and I probably should have posted about it earlier. I&#8217;ve been involved with computer security for a while, and I&#8217;ve been to a bunch of the more popular security and hacker conferences, which is the reason I&#8217;m giving to myself for the book not making a strong impression immediately. The book is very good, it brings to light many aspects of computer security that even most experts don&#8217;t know about. This should be required reading for anyone involved in computer security. That&#8217;s why I picked it up myself, despite being familiar with many of the tactics and general principles from hanging out at <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a> year after year. So, I&#8217;ve gotten that out of the way, it&#8217;s a good book.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s stuck in my mind however has nothing to do with computer security. The question currently gnawing at me: where does social engineering stop and social/business networking start? Is the difference that the social engineer goes in looking for a particular piece of information? Well, that&#8217;s sometimes how business networking works out. A business development gambit might start out by schmoozing a potential client to find out how to best target the sales pitch. Is it that the social engineer tries to get information they&#8217;re not supposed to have? Well, social networking often involves getting a hold of &#8220;juicy&#8221; information. While that might not necessarily represent restricted info, it could certainly mean information which certain parties might not want widely distributed. And that really does equate to restricted info, just without a written policy. So is the difference that an individual engaged in social networking forms a lasting relationship while a social engineer does not? No, cause social engineers try to form recurring relationships where they can. Leaving themselves routes that they can exploit later to fulfill the same kind of service.</p>

<p>The only difference I can see is that the social engineer does not use their real name, and the social networker does. I was originally going to write that as &#8220;the social engineer normally misrepresents themselves while the social networker does not&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s really true. Especially within the realm of business networking. People normally &#8220;misrepresent themselves&#8221; in terms of attempting to make their company appear more powerful or to make it seem like a fledging deal is further along than it really is. Now, of course, I&#8217;m not saying that most of the people involved in business networking are out to steal information from the people they interact with. I&#8217;m just saying that the two concepts blur together quite contiguously.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s probably quite significant. Cause the premise of the book is that the real action in security doesn&#8217;t revolve around firewalls or intrusion detection systems or encryption or any other technology. The real weakness is in the people using those systems, and transferring information in a way that&#8217;s outside of the normal means of connection. The most &#8220;interesting&#8221; transfers of information are not those that occur along controlled lines, but the transfers which are made because someone is acting in some extraordinary way. But then take that statement and apply it to social networking applications. Do social networking applications really catch the flow of information? Well, if misrepresentation plays a big part, probably not all of it. Of course, I have no idea what percentage of exchanges are genuine and which are influenced at least in part my misinformation, so I&#8217;m not at all prepared to make a blanket statement about the impact. But I will say that years and years of computer security work are starting to result in the realization that human interaction issues dwarf technical risks in terms of the current concerns. Of course, this could be due to years and years worth of computer security work tilted too heavily toward technical issues and ignoring human factors, but that&#8217;s a whole other discussion. I&#8217;ll leave it at saying that if you think that the information you have access to is based &#8220;who you know, and who they have access to&#8221;, I urge you to at least skim through the book and read about some counterexamples. They may happen to be only a small percentage of the cases, but sometimes very interesting information patterns arise when someone is able to identify who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> know them and how to use that to their benefit. There are some spectacular examples, but I think every information transaction is placed somewhere along the line between genuine and false. Even if most transactions are tilted strongly toward genuine, the false aspects of them taken as a whole may be very significant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m about to leave for a two week business trip, so I&#8217;ve been running around all over the place. There hasn&#8217;t been time to read my normal round of feeds, let alone post anything of my own. Sorry about that, but I have to admit it might only get worse over the next few weeks. In the meantime I&#8217;ve been kicking around ideas about what kind of posts I should be putting up here when I do have some time to post again. I really liked doing the longer posts. Sure, they took longer, and sometimes didn&#8217;t work out too well, but they gave me a great chance to reflect deeply on a given topic and polish my writing skills somewhat. The shorter posts were normally just tidbits of info from sources I figured were either very interesting or significantly esoteric. The short bits encouraged me to broaden my reach some. Explore new sources so that I would have something interesting at the end of the day. But I also felt like I was just being a shill for the technology industry as a whole sometimes. And this blog is all about keeping it real. I even made up my own gang sign, cause I&#8217;m just that legit. So I think when I get back to it I&#8217;m gonna try for more of the commentary heavy posts. But all you kids out there in teevee land can lend a hand also. Drop me a line and tell me what you were into, or leave a comment, send a carrier pigeon, whatever. Just don&#8217;t tie a note to a brick and hurl it through my window, I hate it when people do that.</p>

<blockquote><p>Blogs are places where we can stop and reflect. Filter out. Slow down. See a different side of an issue. Get the benefit of someone else&#8217;s thinking, but in a personal way, not just as another place we have to absorb more information. It&#8217;s certainly not a new idea that reading enriches our lives. But blogs are a way we can incorporate reading without having to change what we&#8217;re doing (sitting at the computer) and still enjoy some of the pleasure of conversation (most blogs allow comments if you have the time and the urge). And it&#8217;s that personal touch that makes blogs different from all the other data we must take in.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do blogs HAVE to be personal communications channels? No. Is there something built into the technology which forces them to differ from a frequently updated site using traditional HTML publishing tools? No. But there is a cultural norm at work. Most blogs take the form of personal communication in a voice different than the web content from a few years ago. As a group they present a new trend, causing new interest in a reevaluation of communication style.</p>

<p>As a result perceptions of the nature of online communication are changing. People are seeing for the first time the realization of the &#8220;personal publishing medium&#8221;. This is what the homepage was supposed to provide for people back during the early 90&#8217;s when the web first arrived on the scene. Now, a decade later, blogs are filling the role that the personal homepage was supposed to. What&#8217;s different now? It could simply be that there&#8217;s a critical mass of users online, enough that personal publishers are able to attract a readership that justifies their investment of time. Maybe it&#8217;s that users are now comfortable with the web, and they&#8217;re psychologically ready to make the move from consumer to producer. I&#8217;ve heard others say that it normally takes about 10 years for a technology to hit wide adoption. They use the cell phone as an example. No one is absolutely definite what caused the explosive adoption of cell phones - was it size of the cell network, size and weight of the phones, awareness of the public, etc - but at some point the industry experienced explosive growth. The web is just over 10 years old now. Maybe it&#8217;s just hitting puberty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/archives/000050.html">RSS Neighborhood event on Monday</a>, where Scott Young did a great job guiding a free form discussion about RSS in general. The group was pretty varied, but most had some knowledge about what RSS is already. Some people were looking for the description of what exactly RSS should be used for and how it is different than existing methods, and the group never came to a consensus on that. I personally think that&#8217;s a good thing. RSS is not a technology with existing well defined boundaries. It&#8217;s at the start of adoption for a whole new set of tasks. RSS was originally developed at Netscape to allow embedding headlines from one site into a portal site. We&#8217;re seeing it creep out into new areas of usage. I asked about adoption numbers, how many people read RSS of any sort? The rough response was 1% of the &#8220;internet public&#8221; consume RSS. Bill Flitter is supposed to get back to me with info about where that number came from, I suspect that even that number is somewhat inflated. Other people asked about the format itself, why use RSS instead of other delivery methods? There is no good answer to questions like that. I personally think that RSS is too early in the adoption cycle for us to be able to make predictions about what effect it will have on the enterprise. As such, there is no umbrella answer to when you should abandon other techniques and start looking at RSS. So why bother with talking about RSS at all?</p>

<p>I actually have a couple of answers to that question. I&#8217;ll start with the very simple technical one. The first one is that RSS fits well into the existing web server based application structure. Lets take a look at comparing delivering updates via email with exposing an RSS feed for a blog. With email, first we have to provide a way for users to sign up for the updates, so we probably need an extra form or two, and a data store for those email addresses. Then we need a component that actually delivers email, there are lots and many of them are very well developed, but it&#8217;s still another component which the producer needs to set up. &#8220;So what?&#8221; you say, &#8220;the mail notifications feature should be built into the package I use to publish my blog, I don&#8217;t have to worry about it at all.&#8221; This is the argument that programmers and administrators love to use. But the simple fact is the more interacting components there are to a system, the harder it is to debug. Sometimes the setup might be smooth as silk, but other times a potential new user might be frustrated and just give up. On the other hand, RSS feed generation doesn&#8217;t include any new servers or a new transport protocol. For most setups, producing RSS uses exactly the same underlying services as delivering HTML. It might seem like a stupid minor point, but the net result is that generating RSS is easier for the average producer. And in this new world of peer to peer publishing, with literally hundreds of thousands of content producers, anything we can do to make life simpler for them enjoys a fantastic economy of scale. So one of the geek answers is that delivering RSS shares much of the same infrastructure with delivering HTML. But I think this is really just a minor issue compared to the shift in mindset that has come along with the increased uptake of RSS.</p>

<p>What the hell does that mean? What shift in mindset? That&#8217;s one of those questions that doesn&#8217;t have an absolute answer, yet. But it does seem like people think differently about consuming an RSS feed than they do joining an email list. Is it because they can read feeds apart from their normal email? Or because they don&#8217;t have to give away their address? Or because they can merge posts from feeds and read as a group? Or any of a thousand other differences? At this point no one can say definitively. Will RSS even be the format used for syndication? Also hard to say. Will syndication ever really become widespread? Tough call. It is looking like it eventually will reach a large public user base. And if it does there are some issues that potential producers of feeds should be starting to think about. Issues like how to we control our corporate image? Who should be given the right to produce a feed and who should not? How do we apply a security policy to restrict the flow of information if we do have multiple producers within the organization? All of these are good questions to start asking now. These are the things that should be under consideration.</p>

<p>What I find disturbing is the number of people who are ready to throw themselves on one side or the other. Some people say that RSS is the future, absolutely. Others say that RSS is no different than other technologies, so they shouldn&#8217;t bother. Still others say that RSS is the wrong choice for them because of security concerns or issues of controlling corporate image. The simple truth is that we as technologists do not get to make those choices. A new technology is coming out, and people are starting to use it. Maybe it&#8217;s just a temporary blip, and it never reaches anything but a small percentage of users. But all signs seem to indicate that if it does reach large scale usage it will be a major disruptive force. It brings up a lot of questions that organizations will have a hard time answering. And the best way to answer some of those questions is through experimentation. Should everyone run out right away and setup a mechanism for producing RSS feeds? No, I don&#8217;t think so. But if a large part of your business involves frequent communication with your customers, you should at least be paying attention to the trend and thinking about a pilot program. And if you don&#8217;t fit into that group, at least trying to explore the issues that RSS raises is a start. If RSS does get picked up widely, no amount of arguing that it&#8217;s the wrong method of delivery is going to change the fact that it gets used. The issue isn&#8217;t in finding benefit or flaw in the technology, it&#8217;s in understanding the usage. What does RSS provide users that&#8217;s driving it to the front of discussion? Understand the users and try to do what you can to enhance their experience. If your users want RSS, and your competitor uses RSS, and you have a compelling argument for why RSS sucks, guess who wins? Don&#8217;t fall into the common technologists pitfall of assuming that what&#8217;s best for the computer is best for the system as a whole. What&#8217;s best for the system is what&#8217;s best for the users. If this trend does become a revolution, it might have nothing to do with technology at all.</p>
