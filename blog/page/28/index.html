  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/interview_with_ajit_jaokar_and_tony_fish.html">an interview with the authors of OpenGardens over at the Mobile Technology Weblog</a>. I&#8217;m hadn&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://www.opengardens.net">the OpenGardens book</a> before, but I would certainly like to get my hands on a copy. They say they talk about one of the issues I&#8217;ve written about a number of times: how to get an innovative mobile application out into the market given the current environment.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://ebig.org/sig/sig_speakers.aspx?SIGid=36&amp;old=y&amp;EventID=502">presentation on Blogging and the Law</a> that Charles Smith from <a href="http://www.pheedo.com">Pheedo</a> gave last night. Let me get some of the linking and background info out of the way up front:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://eric.blognews.com/blog/_archives/2004/12/7/200004.html">Eric Rice</a> took detailed notes and added a lot to the conversation in general.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.tennantconsulting.com/blog/2004/12/blogs_and_the_l.html">Steve Tennant</a> pulled out the two major points, I agree with what he picked.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://kalsey.com/blog/2004/12/notes_from_blogging_and_the_law/index.html">Adam Kalsey</a> was down for the event and added a lot of comments.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com">Elle Kruszewski</a> was there and her and I worked out what I&#8217;m going to say here after digesting the talk some.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pheedo.info/archives/000228.html">Bill Flitter</a> put the event together and was there to help guide things along.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>A bunch of people have told me that the reason they like reading what I write is that I pick a single thread and help make it clear. I&#8217;m going to try to do that again. Hopefully less will be more, and I can really add something here. Despite a wealth of information that was delivered last night, I think there was a central thread that we never directly stated. Here&#8217;s the problem statement in summary: Corporations need something like <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> to empower their employee bloggers to participate in the blogosphere. That something should probably start out as a blogging policy so that your employees know what they can and can&#8217;t do.</p>

<p>The idea of the creative commons is that if all authors give up some rights to allow others to build on and reuse some of their ideas, the result is an exponential growth of the medium as a whole. This is actually a reversal of the default. The default copyright law gives up so little to the commons that it might as well not exist. The result is a very poor commons, there is very little work that can be built off of and society as a whole suffers. There is a parallel in the employer/employee relationship. The employee has very little right to talk about the company without fear of repercussions. However this results in a very poor relationship the company has with the rest of the world. The only voice heard outside the corporate veil is the whitewashed and approved PR message. By giving up just a bit of the rights it would have a company can gain from the interactions employees have online. Blogging has the potential to help a company establish and maintain a dialog with customers and the market as a whole. But in order to participate companies first need to define the playing field so that employees know they will be treated justly. Like just about any business decision, there is risk involved. By default the employee has to bear all the risk, so the default will be no action on their part. The company has to bear some of the risk if they want to reap the reward. Shift the risk by providing a policy for the bloggers you have, allow them to enter into the conversations. Make sure you don&#8217;t punish them if they act within policy. Even if the conversations you&#8217;re hearing aren&#8217;t what you wanted. Keep in mind that those conversations were probably already going on, you just weren&#8217;t hearing them before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m on my way up to San Francisco, sitting on Caltrain, so I finally have some time to write up one of the posts I&#8217;ve been thinking about.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been spending a bunch of time lately working with online collaboration. In particular I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out what makes some attempts to work together break down when seem to work effortlessly and with little organization. Blogging is one phenomenon I&#8217;ve been paying attention to for a while, and recently I was trying to put my finger on exactly what blogging has really changed. It&#8217;s not like the protocols are fundamentally different. Sure there&#8217;s the Blogger API, and Metaweblog, and Atom, and the reuse and refinement of RSS. But I don&#8217;t think those are what really fuels the changes. So if it&#8217;s all just HTML still, why such a large impact from making tools simpler? I have read a few things recently that help to frame the differences and provide some good models to use in understanding the changes, I&#8217;ll try to describe one of them.</p>

<p>I think about the changes that McLuhan describes about changing mediums when I think about blogging as a practice. I wish I could find the passage, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s in Understanding Media or somewhere else, where he talks about the Protestantism movement and the use of the printing press to mass produce bibles. I think a lot of insight can be drawn from a comparison of the introduction of the printing press and the rise of blogging. The important factor that I realized was that the introduction of the printing press didn&#8217;t change the underlying technology in the books themselves. They were still paper and ink and a binding (and in this case they were even the same content in every instance). In many cases the result was actually a step backward for what most people valued. Bibles used to be beautiful illustrated color manuscripts with intricate bindings. Now they were relatively ugly page after page of black ink. They seemed like a step backward if you placed a pre-guttenburg bible side by side with a post-guttenberg edition.</p>

<p>The major disrupting factor was that the bibles could be produced in large numbers and distributed much more widely. The technology of production was all that had changed, and yet it resulted in sweeping social changes. I think we&#8217;re looking at the same kind of situation with blogging. The underlying technologies facing the end user of the information is the same. Pre-blogging and post-blogging we still have browsers and TCP/IP and HTML. Hell, the blogging version of HTML even suffers from the same &#8220;downgrade&#8221; criticism that the original printing press bibles did, people say it&#8217;s ugly and clumsy. But the tools used to produce information using those technologies have changed, and as a result shifted the power balance. So sure, blogging is just a simple way to produce simple HTML. But the printing press was just a simple way to produce ugly bibles. Despte that, the effects of those bibles were by no means slight, and I don&#8217;t think that the long term effects of blogging will be either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> folks have created <a href="http://winksite.com/books/cc">mobile versions</a> of some <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensed content. I find the whole pattern very interesting, especially now that I&#8217;m helping out with the <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/ourmedia/index.cgi">Ourmedia</a> project. As was <a href="http://www.editorsweblog.org/2004/11/future_of_news_.html">spoken about at the Online News Association conference</a>, many people see the future of online media as being much different than it was in the offline world. The President and CEO of the Associated Press said:</p>

<blockquote><p>You have to let the content flow where the users want to go, and attach your brand - and maybe advertising and e-commerce - to those free-flowing &#8216;atoms&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s what Ourmedia is attempting to do with rich media such as video and computer animation, allow users to release their content under the constraints they choose without having to go through the traditional channel. The WINKsite guys are working on the same kinds of problems. How does someone producing content allow that information to flow out to the mobile network? That&#8217;s the valuable question to have answered. Not staking out a particular set of content and trying to control when and where it can be seen, but figuring out all the ways that a user might want to use your information and being there to answer their needs. Most of the attention here in the US is on the standard Internet usages of RSS and blogging. But I&#8217;m pretty sure that mobile isn&#8217;t very far behind at all.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important that changes such as transforming the news media (if that&#8217;s really what is happening) are as much about changing perceptions as they are about changing technology. Many of the technologies that have driven the current &#8220;revolution&#8221; in blogging have been around for a while. Blogging itself has been around for a while. It took getting them in the hands of the right people with the right set of motiviations to set the changes in motion.  And that&#8217;s as much about people understand the new medium as much as it is about tools evolving the technologies maturing. It will take a while still for most people to follow through on the microcontent revolution, if they ever do. And once people break out of the thought patterns associated with the existing media structures and start to understand that they can shape their interactions online, questions about &#8220;can I get that on my phone?&#8221; won&#8217;t be far behind. <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/006016.htm">Sony Ericsson sees the world of online information services spreading out to mobiles</a> via RSS. And AOL is apparently also <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/006027.htm">interested in delivery to handsets</a>. It&#8217;s definitely not just a dream any more, people are seeing real use for this pattern of interaction. And it&#8217;s not just the geeks asking for it. When AOL shows up, you can be pretty sure they think it&#8217;s going mainstream.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/11/bloggercon_the_.html">Nick Bradbury</a> also stopped by the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=362">vendors gathering we had</a>. I love this comment that he made:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was also asked whether I believed my $1000 donation to BloggerCon was money well spent, and I can only say hell yes. If I don&#8217;t earn an extra $1000 from ideas gained at the conference, then I deserve to be fined.</p></blockquote>

<p>I ran into the post from Nick via Scott&#8217;s post <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/archives/93-BloggerCon,-Vendors,-Nick-and-Me.html">commenting on all the ideas he got during the conference</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Elle and I had <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/backchannelcon/">a bunch of people back to the apartment</a> after <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org">BloggerCon</a> ended. The no vendors rule was the focus of much of the discussion, a lot of the people who showed up were tools providers who felt really shunned by the atitude at the conference. A lot of them came to our little gathering, so we had an impromptu &#8220;VendorCon&#8221;. We had a nice discussion about what everyone was working on and what existing needs there were that were going unserved. I got a chance to thank <a href="http://www.wingedpig.com/">Mark Fletcher</a> personally for the mobile version of Bloglines. That&#8217;s a fantastic tool that I make use of all the time. Met <a href="http://frassle.rura.org/Directory/index?feed=1">Shimon Rura</a>, who&#8217;s working on a soon-to-be open source tool called <a href="http://frassle.net/">Frassle</a>. Was able to thank <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall Kennedy</a> for all the photos he contributed to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bloggercon">the bloggercon tag on Flickr</a>. <a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/">JD Lasica</a> stopped by to do a little campaigning for the <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/ourmedia/index.cgi">Ourmedia</a> project, something I&#8217;m helping out with and excited about myself. <a href="http://www.buzzhit.com/buzzblog.html">Tony Gentile</a> stopped by to toss all sorts of interesting ideas into the mix. <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/">Bill Flitter</a> told us how he envisions helping content producers directly make money from their content. <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russ Beattie</a> showed off his toys and tossed out some ideas related to mobilizing content. <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/archives/91-BloggerCon-Interlude-A-Perfect-Silicon-Valley-Moment.html">Scott Johnson</a> was asking questions and taking notes about the feedback he got. That&#8217;s just really cool, the VP of Engineering at a very succesful company coming out to have a direct conversation.</p>

<p>This is somewhere that I think Dave Winer was really off with BloggerCon. I can understand his motivation to not have vendors dominate the discussion. But these are people who grok the power of online conversation to the point that they&#8217;ve decided to stake at least part of their career on tools to facilitate it. They should be allowed to join in the conversation, and they are capable of listening. Most wouldn&#8217;t be in the positions they are if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that they can listen to their user base.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another point brought up during the <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org">BloggerCon</a> Making Money session was that there are plenty of ways to make money using a blog that have nothing to do with trying to monetize the content directly. There are ways to connect with others and form a collective to do something new, trying to gather together the couple of people from all over the world who have the same kind of passion as yourself and the same ideas. Sure, a blog can be used in the same way that a newspaper or magazine is, as an alternative form of journalism. But that&#8217;s not the only model for use. There are some great oportunities to form new connections, managing new relationships, and facilitate discussion using blogs. It&#8217;s a way to use your blog while making money instead of using your blog to make money. Alternative models like this probably make a lot of sense instead of always looking at the content based model.</p>
