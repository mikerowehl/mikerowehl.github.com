  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">The South by Southwest Music and Media Conference</a> is currently going on in Austin TX. I wasn&#8217;t able to make it, but I&#8217;ve been hanging around in a couple of <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode.net</a> IRC channels and listening to the discussions. Fast Company has a <a href="http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/cat_recon_sxsw_2004.html">series of transcripts</a> that they&#8217;ve uploaded to their blog section, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/sxsw2004/index.cgi?sxsw_interactive_2004">SocialText Wiki that has chat logs from some sessions</a>. So instead of picking and choosing at this point what I want to comment on, I figured I would leave those resources to provide a bit of an overview of what&#8217;s going on down there in that most un-Texas of Texan cities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT3662776604.html">interview with Jeff Dionne</a> up at Linux devices. Jeff did much of the original work on <a href="http://www.uclinux.org/">uClinux</a>, a port of Linux that first supported architectures without memory management units. He&#8217;s been around for quite a while, and I try to listen to what he has to say. I remember reading posts from him back when I was initially getting involved with professional use of Linux in embedded systems, and his insights have been valuable ever since. I particularly liked his response to question 10:</p>

<blockquote><p>Embedded Linux will be everywhere as a part of the C runtime. The market is another matter. For us, we frequently do the ports ourselves, but when sensible, we&#8217;ve contracted ports. It&#8217; interesting to note the number of ports that now come by way of the silicon vendors, submitted to us or other maintainers to put into the CVS. These vendors recognize the value in offering something that helps to develop a product &#8211; tools, application software, training, services &#8211; for free, both as in beer and speech, and that&#8217;s what makes it so successful. So to clarify, I think this means there really is no embedded Linux market per se, but rather a market to serve people who are developing products with embedded Linux.</p></blockquote>

<p>An excellent point, and one that I agree with completely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Textually.org <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/003266.htm">posted</a> about <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100442&amp;ref=591683">an article in The Feature about mobile presence, social networking, and geolocation</a>. I first heard about <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/geopriv-charter.html">the GEOPRIV working group</a> just last month, and haven&#8217;t had much chance to read up on the project. But Howard covers both general commentary about mobile presence, information about the stadards push (or war, whichever you prefer), as well as a pointer to <a href="http://buddyspace.sourceforge.net/">BuddySpace</a>. BuddySpace is an open source Jabber messaging client with support for presenting the buddy list as a geographical map of the location of contacts. Now that&#8217;s some cool work. Really makes we want to get a Palm Jabber client working. There is an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabberpalm/">open source Jabber client for Palm devices</a>, but it requires a Java runtime on the device so I haven&#8217;t tried it out yet. This might provide enough inspiration for me to actually agree to that nasty license thing I would need to click thu in order to download the Java VM for Palm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> is one hell of a badass project. Great information, technically well done, up to date - it&#8217;s got everything that most people would ask for. Unfortunately for me, I have some oddball requirements. Such as wanting the Wikipedia to display well on my Clie. There do seem to be some <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=793969&amp;group_id=34373&amp;atid=411195">Palm specific</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=866314&amp;group_id=34373&amp;atid=411195">general PDA</a> related feature requests in the SourceForge tracker for the project. But I&#8217;m sure the Wikipedia developers have enough to do already without catering to the ultra-dweebie .001% of the computer using population who would be interested in accessing the site from a handheld device. So in the meantime I created the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/pda_wikipedia.cgi">Wikipedia PDA hack</a>. It&#8217;s just a few lines of perl which make it easy to jump from one printable view of a page to another. It&#8217;s not perfect, there are some pages it doesn&#8217;t pick up (for some reason some nodes direct to the edit view of the page). And it explicitly redirects to the English site. If you find these bugs just too terrible to deal with, you can always just grab <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/pda_wikipedia.txt">the source</a> and fix them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell Beattie has two great posts in his blog, the first about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006760.html">web services becoming more like Unix style tools</a> and then some <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006768.html">further discussion about the similarities and differences between the two styles</a>. I groove completely the the beats Russ is laying down. Usages like this are something that made me happy the first time I read about <a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2002/02/06/rest.html">REST</a>. REST seemed to make it easier for arbitrary tools to participate in the series of commands. My comments tend to blend XMLRPC, REST, and SOAP - cause I tend not to pay too much attention to specs and just hack out whatever seems to work for me. Just a couple of quick comments I want to throw into the mix.</p>

<p>The distinction between standard error and standard output is certainly good to have picked out. And maybe keeping those two output streams different will always be a good idea. But I just want to bring up that the reason for having separate output channels is because Unix systems deal with unstructured text. If the output is an XML document, keeping output and processing messages distinct within a single output channel could be done by just specifying the location for the two different types of output. The same goes for input also, processing directives and input material could be mixed in the same input channel if there was a reliable structure for distinguishing between the two. I&#8217;m not saying that this is the right way to go, just another way to look at it.</p>

<p>The issue about sending output to another URL for further processing does break with the Unix style somewhat, but it looks exactly like the <a href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?continuation+passing+style">continuation passing style</a> which has been around in Scheme (and probably other Lisp style languages) for quite a while. Maybe we can take some ideas from that arena to formalize the mechanism. How exactly? I haven&#8217;t really thought that through yet :-) I&#8217;ll post something if I have some good ideas. I was also thinking about including transformation instructions with the continuations. I don&#8217;t think this is my original idea, I just can&#8217;t remember where I saw it. Generally it would mean including something like an XSLT transformation to be executed either after one processing stage or before the next. That should make it easy to hook up services that don&#8217;t really know much about each other. But given that we&#8217;re already passing around the data as a whole, perhaps we just need a well known URL for the transformation service and get that included anywhere we need to massage formats. Either one would probably work.</p>

<p>SOAP already has <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part1-20030624/#senderreceiverconcepts">a concept of intermediaries</a>, which are nodes that route and partially process a message. They&#8217;re already both senders and receivers, so they look a lot like the kind of processing nodes that would be needed to form a pipeline. I&#8217;m certainly not a SOAP expert, but I think those intermediaries are only used to route the message and transform the wrappers for the real payload. What we would be talking about doesn&#8217;t change things too much, we would just be elevating intermediaries to primary addressable nodes and allowing them to have a much more active part in the processing of the payload. The usage patterns look much different when we make these changes, but I don&#8217;t think the underlying model changes all that much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Engadget had a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7673568580289881/">post about a novel delivered to cell phones in 1,600 word installments</a>, which sounded interesting but I held off posting about it for a while. The concept does have some initial &#8220;neat&#8221; factor to it, but I wanted to mull it over for a little while. This post is really about communication methods changing and shaping the content of communication, and not just about this novel delivered to cell phones. The novel does display a lot of factors I want to talk about however. Most important, that the structure of the novel was based in part on the delivery method. Not just that it was broken up, but that the author chose a writing style that was more concise and action oriented. But that got me thinking about how often communication is not targeted to the methods being used. In particular, the use of hyperlinks in web pages. The use of links we see today is almost nothing like the way they were intended to work. If you want to see the way they were intended to work, take a look at online documentation about programming languages. Just about <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/imageio/stream/ImageInputStream.html">anything from the Java docs at Sun should do</a>. Links have mostly turned into menu items, leading to other areas you can go to and not necessarily threading together thoughts or concepts.</p>

<p>One area where this is reversing somewhat is within the blogging community. The links that people put in their blogs do point to related topics, and they do point to writings by others on like issues. But they remain relatively isolated nodes. Most entries only have one link to the story being commented on, and then perhaps trackback links for others who have responded. I have a vision of linking in which the links from a number of terms on the same page lead off to related thoughts or further information. Probably because I still remember the initial description of hypertext I heard when <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/lee.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a> gave instantiation to the mostly theoretical concept. I can&#8217;t find the page right now, but I once saw someone&#8217;s writing who made excellent use of hyperlinks and bolding within the document. If I ever find it again it might serve as my shining example of proper use of a medium. The bolding and the hyperlinks together served as perfect markers for speed reading. There is a Style Guide for Hypertext, and it does have <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html">a section on the use of links</a>, but it&#8217;s a very cursory treatment. I have no idea what effect it really would have on a large scale, but just imagine if most major news stories were really marked up with background info. Currently almost everything on the major news sites has no real markup in the stories. Maybe a company name or two, or very simple definitions - but even that is uncommon.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve started reading <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=174">Interface Culture</a> I know I&#8217;ve been paying a lot more attention to my use of links in my entries. Is that a good or a bad thing? I&#8217;m not quite sure yet, but I should know in a few weeks. I suspect that it will change the way that I think about the information I put up. Much the way that the act of blogging has changed the way that I process the information that I run across. Now that I pull little tidbits of news out of the flow of information and write my own entries about them I am a lot more introspective. I actually feel more in touch with both the things I&#8217;m doing and the things I read about. The vast galaxy of information has started to resolve into a couple of relatively distinct constellations. And I have something of an idea about how I think my projects relate to what others are working on. Sure, last year I could have regurgitated a list of a dozen people working on like projects. I had all the information. The difference is that this year I can answer questions like &#8220;how does that really relate to what you&#8217;re doing&#8221; and &#8220;why do you think they&#8217;ve chosen to do things that way&#8221;. However, it also means that there are some issues I don&#8217;t know about which last year I might have. I can only assume that this is a good thing. I must have been operating beyond my true capacity to process before. I was gathering and storing, but not processing.</p>

<p>How does that relate to our rather half-assed use of hypertext? Does the lack of craft put into transferring content online mean that everyone is trying to work beyond their real capacity? Or does everyone just think that hypertext is useful only within a relatively limited set of applications? And that it&#8217;s serving as best it can within online publishing and doesn&#8217;t need to be pushed further? I don&#8217;t think I buy that. I think the information that goes online does need to be marked up more. And it might not just mean inserting some hyperlinks either. The people working on making the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> a reality probably really are onto something. Maybe the reason it looks so far off is because the web is so heavily populated by information which is ill suited to the medium. Does that mean that the semantic web demands too much? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>This post has no real conclusion by the way. I don&#8217;t really know what I think about the issues as a whole. Some recent thoughts about online collaboration and the mixed forms of documents and content have gotten me thinking about the nature of communication in general. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what those thoughts are, but I think most of The Internet has really been under-realized. Probably because smaller and more obvious goals were in place at the time. A lot more can be done to facilitate communication and collaboration online.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Mar-12.html">post in Miguel&#8217;s blog</a> mentions a system called Gnome Notifier, which provides a way for applications to use area in the panel to get the users attention rather than using popups. I thought that <a href="http://www.xchat.org/">XChat</a> used to have a panel component that would tell you what tabs had activity, so that you could switch to another desktop and know when to switch back (without having to turn sound on&#8230; ugh, I hate notification sounds). But I can&#8217;t find the options on my <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> system, so maybe I just imagined that. I would love to see notifications go to the panel instead of popups.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;m sure most of you already know, I have a package for Palm handhelds called <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> that allows posting directly from a Palm handheld to all sorts of blogging services. I finally released the 1.9 version today. I was on the road for the last month pretty much, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to make any of the updates I should have. This release fixes the default <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> hostname, and adds TypePad, B2, and LiveJournal to the list of supported services. I had to reduce the number of unregistered posts to 5 however. Sorry to be a dick, but there was just too much moochin of my l33t0 warez going on. I&#8217;ll make up for it by hacking some <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">Open Palm Environment</a> tools this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gadgetopia <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/03/11/ComputerLanguagesHistory.html">posted</a> about a <a href="http://www.levenez.com/lang/history.html">timeline of computer languges</a>. The chart is actually part of a <a href="http://www.levenez.com/lang/">Computer Languages History page</a>, which has links to all sorts of great info. Taking a look at the chart itself it seems like there isn&#8217;t as much cross-pollination of languages as there used to be. I could be wrong, and I&#8217;m just overlooking some aspects of the chart. But it seems like many of the popular scripting languages (Perl, Ruby, Python) pulled from lots of original sources and have shot out up to the present, and there are others like C, OCAML, and Scheme that have just been around forever. Is this indicative of stagnation? Or has a nice natural organization been found, and the initial turbulent years where the aberration? The way it looks now, at the expense of overgeneralization, is that there are  amalgam languages that have pulled influence from many different sources in order to allow flexability, and there are some languages that stick to a single style. There are exceptions of course, independent languages which allow for programming in many different styles. But have we discovered all the basic programming paradigms (functionaly, imperative, message passing, etc.)? There is still a lot of progress that needs to be made in the software engineering field, we obviously aren&#8217;t at the end of the process as a whole. But the progress can come either from lower level discoveries (such as a new basic paradigm for code organzation) or it can come from higher level software engineering practices (use case modeling, CASE, extreme programming, etc.). I&#8217;m not convinced that there aren&#8217;t more fundamental changes coming down the line. If people were working on them, I would expect to see more languages instability. Maybe it&#8217;s just lost in the noise now because there are so many languges out there, and either the next advance hasn&#8217;t happened yet or it hasn&#8217;t reached mainstream usage.</p>

Dave Harper, one of the driving forces behind <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> (which is just one instantiation of the general <a href="http://www.wirelessink.com/">Wireless Ink</a> technology), has been laying out some interesting topics. Even though it&#8217;s one of the older updates, I highly recommend <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?blog_id=929">the post about <em>Mobilizing The Masses With &#8220;Location Aware&#8221; Applications</em></a>. I&#8217;ve added the blog feed to my newsreader, hoping that we&#8217;ll see more great tidbits from the east coast crew. Another interesting bit of info, I just realized that one of Dave&#8217;s WINK sites has help forums and the WINK blog feed. Check out <a href="http://winksite.com/dharper/help">http://winksite.com/dharper/help</a> (WINKsite # 1562).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=174">currently reading Interface Culture</a>, and some of the stories about the early adoption of hypertext remind me a lot of what seems to be going on with mobile content. We&#8217;re still in a very investigatory phase with relation to mobile services and publishing. Some of us see a lot of potential, but aren&#8217;t quite able to make the full jump all the way to what our vision of mobile services should be. Others don&#8217;t really see the value in the medium yet so they&#8217;re holding back. And I think just like what happened with the web, eventually everyone will end up using mobile services. But once we&#8217;re there the believers will be saying &#8220;see, I told you mobile services were going to have a major impact&#8221;, while the skeptics will be saying &#8220;see, I told you that mobile services weren&#8217;t going to work the way they were originally brought out&#8221;. And both groups are going to be correct to a point. The end result of a stream of innovation such as is happening within wireless and mobile communications almost never ends up looking like what the original conception was. That&#8217;s part of the definition of a successfull technology. It gets adopted and adapted and extended by the people who first see the strong applications for it. Those applications are not normally technology driven, so the &#8220;cool&#8221; stuff that us technologists see coming down the line may or may not have anything to do with the user applications that first drive adoption. The best thing we can do is make something (anything) available to users and then see what they do with it. Release the technology and see what the people come up with. People ask me why I use WINKsite as an example all the time. Well, this is it. They&#8217;ve got a technology that they think is going to be big at some point, so they put up a public site to let people experiment with it and learn about how it could be used. I consider that a perfect example of proper planning for innovation.</p>
