  <div class="entry-content"><p>I put a new area up at Bitsplitter, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">Bitsplitter Link Blog</a>. &#8220;So what&#8217;s the difference between the normal blog and the link blog?&#8221; one might be expected to ask. Well the link blog is for short mentions of things that I want to come back and look at when I have some more time, the main blog is for commentary and things that I know I was interested in and I want to share. There is an additional aspect to the link blog however, it&#8217;s actually more PDA friendly than the normal blog. <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">This blog that you&#8217;re reading now</a> is minimally formatted so that it displays well on PDA screens, but the articles that I link to aren&#8217;t always good for small screens. On the other hand, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">link blog</a> is both PDA friendly and links to items that are PDA friendly. The link blog came about because I wanted a way to get certain links that I was bookmarking to transfer over to my PDA so I could read them when I wasn&#8217;t sitting at my desktop. Rather than making up something new, I decided to just put them in a blog. I didn&#8217;t want to clutter up the main Bitsplitter blog with a bunch of junk that I wasn&#8217;t even sure I would be interested in. So I started a whole new area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Havoc Pennington <a href="http://ometer.com/desktop-language.html">posted an entry in his weblog</a> about picking a language/architecture/platform for Linux desktop development. I found the post as a whole to be very informative. I think his observations about needing to proceed with a completely unencumbered set of tools and technology are right on:</p>

<blockquote><p>To me the way to create something that most of the community can swallow is to stick strictly to open source, unencumbered technologies. This means there&#8217;s a level playing field; anyone can hire developers to contribute to the technologies, anyone can fork if they have to. It&#8217;s essential that our high-level language technology have no single owner with irrevocable control.</p></blockquote>

<p>Open source creates this level playing field, and that&#8217;s why it historically <em>works</em> as a way for diverse companies and individuals to collaborate on software projects. Without the level playing field, everyone gets too paranoid and fragmentation or stagnation are inevitable.</p>

<p>Absolutely. And he goes on to describe why the decisions are tricky, why nothing currently fulfills all the criteria, and possible paths to improving the situation. Excellent post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got back from dinner with a friend who&#8217;s working at <a href="http://www.akimbo.com/">Akimbo</a>. I hadn&#8217;t heard about the system before, but he says it has turned out quite well. It&#8217;s a video on demand system with actual content available. Unlike the video on demand systems being setup by cable companies, it&#8217;s not just a replacement for Pay Per View. The system pulls content from all sorts of content providers, allowing these producers to monetize their content without having to go through the cable companies (or other nefarious media organizations). Wooohoo!! This is the other half of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> style empowerment of individuals to produce rich media. There should be a way to get that content out there, and make money off it if that&#8217;s what you want, without having to bed down with a cable network. I could see a system like this allowing grassroots producers to create shows that wouldn&#8217;t get picked up by the existing media distribution channels - and yet still reach wide and geographically dispersed audiences. Should be great for indie films. Great idea, good luck guys!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found the paper <a href="http://www.md.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html">Why Functional Programming Matters</a> linked off a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/aboutHaskell.html">page about Haskell</a>. Both make some interesting points about the general features of functional programming. In particular I like the comparison between lazy evaluation and pipes, which is something I haven&#8217;t run across before in descriptions of that feature. The Why Functional Programming Matters paper jumps into some very specific examples in the process of making its point, which is something that in general I don&#8217;t find very convincing. It&#8217;s easy to find examples of problems that work well in certain languges or using certain programming styles. But the statements made about being able to compose programs from other full programs and the lack of side-effects leading to better modularization are good points. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> looks quite interesting, but I think I&#8217;m going to stick with trying to learn <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a> first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">The South by Southwest Music and Media Conference</a> is currently going on in Austin TX. I wasn&#8217;t able to make it, but I&#8217;ve been hanging around in a couple of <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode.net</a> IRC channels and listening to the discussions. Fast Company has a <a href="http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/cat_recon_sxsw_2004.html">series of transcripts</a> that they&#8217;ve uploaded to their blog section, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/sxsw2004/index.cgi?sxsw_interactive_2004">SocialText Wiki that has chat logs from some sessions</a>. So instead of picking and choosing at this point what I want to comment on, I figured I would leave those resources to provide a bit of an overview of what&#8217;s going on down there in that most un-Texas of Texan cities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT3662776604.html">interview with Jeff Dionne</a> up at Linux devices. Jeff did much of the original work on <a href="http://www.uclinux.org/">uClinux</a>, a port of Linux that first supported architectures without memory management units. He&#8217;s been around for quite a while, and I try to listen to what he has to say. I remember reading posts from him back when I was initially getting involved with professional use of Linux in embedded systems, and his insights have been valuable ever since. I particularly liked his response to question 10:</p>

<blockquote><p>Embedded Linux will be everywhere as a part of the C runtime. The market is another matter. For us, we frequently do the ports ourselves, but when sensible, we&#8217;ve contracted ports. It&#8217; interesting to note the number of ports that now come by way of the silicon vendors, submitted to us or other maintainers to put into the CVS. These vendors recognize the value in offering something that helps to develop a product &#8211; tools, application software, training, services &#8211; for free, both as in beer and speech, and that&#8217;s what makes it so successful. So to clarify, I think this means there really is no embedded Linux market per se, but rather a market to serve people who are developing products with embedded Linux.</p></blockquote>

<p>An excellent point, and one that I agree with completely.</p>

I first heard about <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/geopriv-charter.html">the GEOPRIV working group</a> just last month, and haven&#8217;t had much chance to read up on the project. But Howard covers both general commentary about mobile presence, information about the stadards push (or war, whichever you prefer), as well as a pointer to <a href="http://buddyspace.sourceforge.net/">BuddySpace</a>. BuddySpace is an open source Jabber messaging client with support for presenting the buddy list as a geographical map of the location of contacts. Now that&#8217;s some cool work. Really makes we want to get a Palm Jabber client working. There is an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabberpalm/">open source Jabber client for Palm devices</a>, but it requires a Java runtime on the device so I haven&#8217;t tried it out yet. This might provide enough inspiration for me to actually agree to that nasty license thing I would need to click thu in order to download the Java VM for Palm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> is one hell of a badass project. Great information, technically well done, up to date - it&#8217;s got everything that most people would ask for. Unfortunately for me, I have some oddball requirements. Such as wanting the Wikipedia to display well on my Clie. There do seem to be some <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=793969&amp;group_id=34373&amp;atid=411195">Palm specific</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=866314&amp;group_id=34373&amp;atid=411195">general PDA</a> related feature requests in the SourceForge tracker for the project. But I&#8217;m sure the Wikipedia developers have enough to do already without catering to the ultra-dweebie .001% of the computer using population who would be interested in accessing the site from a handheld device. So in the meantime I created the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/pda_wikipedia.cgi">Wikipedia PDA hack</a>. It&#8217;s just a few lines of perl which make it easy to jump from one printable view of a page to another. It&#8217;s not perfect, there are some pages it doesn&#8217;t pick up (for some reason some nodes direct to the edit view of the page). And it explicitly redirects to the English site. If you find these bugs just too terrible to deal with, you can always just grab <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/pda_wikipedia.txt">the source</a> and fix them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell Beattie has two great posts in his blog, the first about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006760.html">web services becoming more like Unix style tools</a> and then some <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006768.html">further discussion about the similarities and differences between the two styles</a>. I groove completely the the beats Russ is laying down. Usages like this are something that made me happy the first time I read about <a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2002/02/06/rest.html">REST</a>. REST seemed to make it easier for arbitrary tools to participate in the series of commands. My comments tend to blend XMLRPC, REST, and SOAP - cause I tend not to pay too much attention to specs and just hack out whatever seems to work for me. Just a couple of quick comments I want to throw into the mix.</p>

<p>The distinction between standard error and standard output is certainly good to have picked out. And maybe keeping those two output streams different will always be a good idea. But I just want to bring up that the reason for having separate output channels is because Unix systems deal with unstructured text. If the output is an XML document, keeping output and processing messages distinct within a single output channel could be done by just specifying the location for the two different types of output. The same goes for input also, processing directives and input material could be mixed in the same input channel if there was a reliable structure for distinguishing between the two. I&#8217;m not saying that this is the right way to go, just another way to look at it.</p>

<p>The issue about sending output to another URL for further processing does break with the Unix style somewhat, but it looks exactly like the <a href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?continuation+passing+style">continuation passing style</a> which has been around in Scheme (and probably other Lisp style languages) for quite a while. Maybe we can take some ideas from that arena to formalize the mechanism. How exactly? I haven&#8217;t really thought that through yet :-) I&#8217;ll post something if I have some good ideas. I was also thinking about including transformation instructions with the continuations. I don&#8217;t think this is my original idea, I just can&#8217;t remember where I saw it. Generally it would mean including something like an XSLT transformation to be executed either after one processing stage or before the next. That should make it easy to hook up services that don&#8217;t really know much about each other. But given that we&#8217;re already passing around the data as a whole, perhaps we just need a well known URL for the transformation service and get that included anywhere we need to massage formats. Either one would probably work.</p>

<p>SOAP already has <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part1-20030624/#senderreceiverconcepts">a concept of intermediaries</a>, which are nodes that route and partially process a message. They&#8217;re already both senders and receivers, so they look a lot like the kind of processing nodes that would be needed to form a pipeline. I&#8217;m certainly not a SOAP expert, but I think those intermediaries are only used to route the message and transform the wrappers for the real payload. What we would be talking about doesn&#8217;t change things too much, we would just be elevating intermediaries to primary addressable nodes and allowing them to have a much more active part in the processing of the payload. The usage patterns look much different when we make these changes, but I don&#8217;t think the underlying model changes all that much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Engadget had a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7673568580289881/">post about a novel delivered to cell phones in 1,600 word installments</a>, which sounded interesting but I held off posting about it for a while. The concept does have some initial &#8220;neat&#8221; factor to it, but I wanted to mull it over for a little while. This post is really about communication methods changing and shaping the content of communication, and not just about this novel delivered to cell phones. The novel does display a lot of factors I want to talk about however. Most important, that the structure of the novel was based in part on the delivery method. Not just that it was broken up, but that the author chose a writing style that was more concise and action oriented. But that got me thinking about how often communication is not targeted to the methods being used. In particular, the use of hyperlinks in web pages. The use of links we see today is almost nothing like the way they were intended to work. If you want to see the way they were intended to work, take a look at online documentation about programming languages. Just about <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/imageio/stream/ImageInputStream.html">anything from the Java docs at Sun should do</a>. Links have mostly turned into menu items, leading to other areas you can go to and not necessarily threading together thoughts or concepts.</p>

<p>One area where this is reversing somewhat is within the blogging community. The links that people put in their blogs do point to related topics, and they do point to writings by others on like issues. But they remain relatively isolated nodes. Most entries only have one link to the story being commented on, and then perhaps trackback links for others who have responded. I have a vision of linking in which the links from a number of terms on the same page lead off to related thoughts or further information. Probably because I still remember the initial description of hypertext I heard when <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/lee.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a> gave instantiation to the mostly theoretical concept. I can&#8217;t find the page right now, but I once saw someone&#8217;s writing who made excellent use of hyperlinks and bolding within the document. If I ever find it again it might serve as my shining example of proper use of a medium. The bolding and the hyperlinks together served as perfect markers for speed reading. There is a Style Guide for Hypertext, and it does have <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html">a section on the use of links</a>, but it&#8217;s a very cursory treatment. I have no idea what effect it really would have on a large scale, but just imagine if most major news stories were really marked up with background info. Currently almost everything on the major news sites has no real markup in the stories. Maybe a company name or two, or very simple definitions - but even that is uncommon.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve started reading <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=174">Interface Culture</a> I know I&#8217;ve been paying a lot more attention to my use of links in my entries. Is that a good or a bad thing? I&#8217;m not quite sure yet, but I should know in a few weeks. I suspect that it will change the way that I think about the information I put up. Much the way that the act of blogging has changed the way that I process the information that I run across. Now that I pull little tidbits of news out of the flow of information and write my own entries about them I am a lot more introspective. I actually feel more in touch with both the things I&#8217;m doing and the things I read about. The vast galaxy of information has started to resolve into a couple of relatively distinct constellations. And I have something of an idea about how I think my projects relate to what others are working on. Sure, last year I could have regurgitated a list of a dozen people working on like projects. I had all the information. The difference is that this year I can answer questions like &#8220;how does that really relate to what you&#8217;re doing&#8221; and &#8220;why do you think they&#8217;ve chosen to do things that way&#8221;. However, it also means that there are some issues I don&#8217;t know about which last year I might have. I can only assume that this is a good thing. I must have been operating beyond my true capacity to process before. I was gathering and storing, but not processing.</p>

<p>How does that relate to our rather half-assed use of hypertext? Does the lack of craft put into transferring content online mean that everyone is trying to work beyond their real capacity? Or does everyone just think that hypertext is useful only within a relatively limited set of applications? And that it&#8217;s serving as best it can within online publishing and doesn&#8217;t need to be pushed further? I don&#8217;t think I buy that. I think the information that goes online does need to be marked up more. And it might not just mean inserting some hyperlinks either. The people working on making the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> a reality probably really are onto something. Maybe the reason it looks so far off is because the web is so heavily populated by information which is ill suited to the medium. Does that mean that the semantic web demands too much? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>This post has no real conclusion by the way. I don&#8217;t really know what I think about the issues as a whole. Some recent thoughts about online collaboration and the mixed forms of documents and content have gotten me thinking about the nature of communication in general. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what those thoughts are, but I think most of The Internet has really been under-realized. Probably because smaller and more obvious goals were in place at the time. A lot more can be done to facilitate communication and collaboration online.</p>
