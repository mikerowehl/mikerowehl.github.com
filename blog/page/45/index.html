<p>This is essentially a debate about how to go forward with development of an open source desktop system, in particular what technologies and languages to use in implementing the system itself. I think it&#8217;s interesting to see all the issues that go into making a decision such as this, as of course there are both technical and nontechnical factors.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a>, I would suggest at least skimming the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/faq.html">FAQ</a>. Compatibility with the .NET system appears to have heavily influenced much of the discussion so far. The planned operating system Longhorn (a Microsoft product) apparently exposes .NET interfaces and plugin APIs at many different levels of the OS. It&#8217;s an excellent idea for a desktop system, but it&#8217;s also not a new idea. Why start playing catchup on this concept because Microsoft has decided to implement it? If we want a pluggable desktop system which exposes all user information as objects I would personally opt for building one without waiting to see what Microsoft has done. Compatibility with Longhorn is important, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the only way to get advanced desktop features is by waiting to copy a commercial product. I really hope it&#8217;s not the only way at least. But with the US patent system in the state that it&#8217;s in, maybe that is the only viable option.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brian Cantoni has a <a href="http://www.cantoni.org/2004/03/12/moblog">post about mo:Blog</a>, a mobile blogging application that looks to be a lot more feature rich than my <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> application. I&#8217;ll have to fool around with it at some point, it says it can even upload binary attachments (like images). That definitely kicks ass in general, but it does mean some pretty stiff competition for Vagablog. I&#8217;ve been sorta wavering on the whole issue of adding Atom support into Vagablog. It would be a cool hack, but there&#8217;s no economic incentive. Vagablog just isn&#8217;t making enough money to make it worthwhile. I might keep Vagablog at the slim and simple (and cheap) end of the scale. So for those of you looking for advanced capabilities like image uploading and post editing, check out <a href="http://www.tektonica.com/projects/moblog/">mo:Blog</a>. It seems like it&#8217;s already quite advanced, and should fit the bill for those of you who said you were looking for some more features in a Palm weblogging app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Larry Lessig <a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/trends/04/03/17/156205.shtml?tid=137&amp;tid=147">gave a presentation on why the protection of IP is important for the creative process</a>. It sounds like it was the same set of material that <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=167">he tried out on us over at Stanford</a>. Lessig has a new book on the market called <a href="http://the-future-of-ideas.com/"><strong>The Future of Ideas</strong></a>, something I&#8217;m certainly going to pick up and read. There was a quote I particularly liked in there:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let the commercial interests compete on execution of the ideas; that&#8217;s the free enterprise system,&#8221; Lessig said. &#8220;But the creators need to maintain the freedom to distribute their ideas any way they want. They shouldn&#8217;t be bogged down by 20-year copyrights and other old restrictions that bottle up good ideas&#8221; [and] keep them on the shelf, Lessig said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which reminded me that the mobile publishing site <a href="http://www.winksite.com">WINKsite</a> has <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?blog_id=1208">added support for marking content as covered by Creative Commons licenses</a>. So of course I quickly ran out and marked <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/unrooted">the Unrooted mobile site</a> and <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope">the Open Palm Environment mobile site</a> as wonderfully liberating <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/">ShareAlike</a> content. I actually think I might feel another WINKsite coming on&#8230; I feel the urge to experiment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I put a new area up at Bitsplitter, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">Bitsplitter Link Blog</a>. &#8220;So what&#8217;s the difference between the normal blog and the link blog?&#8221; one might be expected to ask. Well the link blog is for short mentions of things that I want to come back and look at when I have some more time, the main blog is for commentary and things that I know I was interested in and I want to share. There is an additional aspect to the link blog however, it&#8217;s actually more PDA friendly than the normal blog. <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">This blog that you&#8217;re reading now</a> is minimally formatted so that it displays well on PDA screens, but the articles that I link to aren&#8217;t always good for small screens. On the other hand, the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">link blog</a> is both PDA friendly and links to items that are PDA friendly. The link blog came about because I wanted a way to get certain links that I was bookmarking to transfer over to my PDA so I could read them when I wasn&#8217;t sitting at my desktop. Rather than making up something new, I decided to just put them in a blog. I didn&#8217;t want to clutter up the main Bitsplitter blog with a bunch of junk that I wasn&#8217;t even sure I would be interested in. So I started a whole new area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Havoc Pennington <a href="http://ometer.com/desktop-language.html">posted an entry in his weblog</a> about picking a language/architecture/platform for Linux desktop development. I found the post as a whole to be very informative. I think his observations about needing to proceed with a completely unencumbered set of tools and technology are right on:</p>

<blockquote><p>To me the way to create something that most of the community can swallow is to stick strictly to open source, unencumbered technologies. This means there&#8217;s a level playing field; anyone can hire developers to contribute to the technologies, anyone can fork if they have to. It&#8217;s essential that our high-level language technology have no single owner with irrevocable control.</p></blockquote>

<p>Open source creates this level playing field, and that&#8217;s why it historically <em>works</em> as a way for diverse companies and individuals to collaborate on software projects. Without the level playing field, everyone gets too paranoid and fragmentation or stagnation are inevitable.</p>

<p>Absolutely. And he goes on to describe why the decisions are tricky, why nothing currently fulfills all the criteria, and possible paths to improving the situation. Excellent post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got back from dinner with a friend who&#8217;s working at <a href="http://www.akimbo.com/">Akimbo</a>. I hadn&#8217;t heard about the system before, but he says it has turned out quite well. It&#8217;s a video on demand system with actual content available. Unlike the video on demand systems being setup by cable companies, it&#8217;s not just a replacement for Pay Per View. The system pulls content from all sorts of content providers, allowing these producers to monetize their content without having to go through the cable companies (or other nefarious media organizations). Wooohoo!! This is the other half of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> style empowerment of individuals to produce rich media. There should be a way to get that content out there, and make money off it if that&#8217;s what you want, without having to bed down with a cable network. I could see a system like this allowing grassroots producers to create shows that wouldn&#8217;t get picked up by the existing media distribution channels - and yet still reach wide and geographically dispersed audiences. Should be great for indie films. Great idea, good luck guys!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found the paper <a href="http://www.md.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html">Why Functional Programming Matters</a> linked off a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/aboutHaskell.html">page about Haskell</a>. Both make some interesting points about the general features of functional programming. In particular I like the comparison between lazy evaluation and pipes, which is something I haven&#8217;t run across before in descriptions of that feature. The Why Functional Programming Matters paper jumps into some very specific examples in the process of making its point, which is something that in general I don&#8217;t find very convincing. It&#8217;s easy to find examples of problems that work well in certain languges or using certain programming styles. But the statements made about being able to compose programs from other full programs and the lack of side-effects leading to better modularization are good points. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> looks quite interesting, but I think I&#8217;m going to stick with trying to learn <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a> first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">The South by Southwest Music and Media Conference</a> is currently going on in Austin TX. I wasn&#8217;t able to make it, but I&#8217;ve been hanging around in a couple of <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode.net</a> IRC channels and listening to the discussions. Fast Company has a <a href="http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/cat_recon_sxsw_2004.html">series of transcripts</a> that they&#8217;ve uploaded to their blog section, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/sxsw2004/index.cgi?sxsw_interactive_2004">SocialText Wiki that has chat logs from some sessions</a>. So instead of picking and choosing at this point what I want to comment on, I figured I would leave those resources to provide a bit of an overview of what&#8217;s going on down there in that most un-Texas of Texan cities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT3662776604.html">interview with Jeff Dionne</a> up at Linux devices. Jeff did much of the original work on <a href="http://www.uclinux.org/">uClinux</a>, a port of Linux that first supported architectures without memory management units. He&#8217;s been around for quite a while, and I try to listen to what he has to say. I remember reading posts from him back when I was initially getting involved with professional use of Linux in embedded systems, and his insights have been valuable ever since. I particularly liked his response to question 10:</p>

<blockquote><p>Embedded Linux will be everywhere as a part of the C runtime. The market is another matter. For us, we frequently do the ports ourselves, but when sensible, we&#8217;ve contracted ports. It&#8217; interesting to note the number of ports that now come by way of the silicon vendors, submitted to us or other maintainers to put into the CVS. These vendors recognize the value in offering something that helps to develop a product &#8211; tools, application software, training, services &#8211; for free, both as in beer and speech, and that&#8217;s what makes it so successful. So to clarify, I think this means there really is no embedded Linux market per se, but rather a market to serve people who are developing products with embedded Linux.</p></blockquote>

<p>An excellent point, and one that I agree with completely.</p>
