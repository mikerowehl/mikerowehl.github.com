<p>Director, Product Management, Yahoo! Mobile</p>

<p>Yahoo things about three groups - communications, information, entertainment.</p>

<p>communication - IM, mail, photos</p>

<p>information - search, wap for news, sports, weather, and alerts</p>

<p>entertainment - downloadable brew games, ringtones from launch</p>

<p>Distribution is a big issue, yahoo has a great relationship with carriers.</p>

<p>Opportunity - Yahoo heard that users wanted to take their information with them on mobile phones. So they launced send to phone.</p>

<p>Simple form sends basic info like phone number and cross street info.  If you go past the limits of SMS (160 chars), for instance driving directions, it sends a text message with a link to a WAP page.</p>

<p>Challenges -</p>

<p>reach vs. quality of user interface (they wanted to maximize reach so they went with SMS and WAP).</p>

<p>Abuse protection, but didn&#8217;t want there to be a high barrier to use. So they limited on the send and receive side.  Number of messages that can to to a single device.</p>

<p>Price sensitivity. Can&#8217;t send a whole lot of messages.</p>

<p>Verizon WAP integration. Verizon doesn&#8217;t extract the URL.</p>

<p>Results -</p>

<p>Significant adoption among PC audience. A direct call to action resulted in a 10x increase in click through.</p>

<p>Great user feedback and press.</p>

<p>Interest internally among more Yahoo properties to launch &#8220;send to phone&#8221;</p>

<p>Next steps -</p>

<p>Extend to more properties.</p>

<p>Extend to MMS and other delivery mechanisms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fabrizio speaking at <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/04/april-mobile-monday-tonight.html">the April MoMo</a>.</p>

<p>Fabrizio is from <a href="http://sync4j.funambol.com/main.jsp?main=theproject">Funambol</a>, the company behind an open source SyncML project with more than 10,000 downloads to date.</p>

<p>SyncML does data management (contacts, appointments) and device management (&#8220;can you fix my device&#8221; and the carrier can fix the device remotely).</p>

<p>They take data from different sources and put it out over SyncML (ERP, CRM, Email servers).  Most devices already have a SyncML client installed (calendar, contacts, ie).</p>

<p>They also have clients for pocketpc, palm is coming.</p>

<p>They also have multiple APIs into the platform to put information from a datasource into a device, and then the device can work offline.</p>

<p>Lots of downloads, growing quickly, lots of developers, great ramp.</p>

<p>Today they are launching is a Sync4j portal. Free, come and use it. Contacts, calendar, plugin for outlook that puts data online, palm can upload, pocket pc can upload. Currently in alpha.</p>

<p>They need to get data from different sources (gmail calendar, yahoo address book), calendar with mozilla.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re putting up a database with all the devices and the SyncML support and how to use it.</p>

<p>If you need to develop a wireless app that needs data try Sync4J.  If you get it to work give Funambol some feedback. Want to add audio and pictures. info at funambol.com And if you want to work for a cool mobile open source company, mail him as well. Looking for marketing, presales engineers, that type of thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Igor Jablokov presenting at <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/04/april-mobile-monday-tonight.html">Mobile Monday</a> -</p>

<p>He was talking about a mixed voice and text interface, allowing users to speak at applications and application to speak back.  It has a markup that hooks into an existing application.  An example was given of voice enabling something like Friendster. I assume this is something like VoiceXML, which gave keywords and mappings to screen translations (state transitions).  There&#8217;s a W3C working group, and they&#8217;ve used existing W3C standards to build the markup they use. I think <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/pervasive/multimodal/">this is the right starting point</a> for more information about what he was talking about.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the problem with the mobile web? cumbersome and frusterating, lots of screens, keypads and screens are too small, UI for every mobile is different.</p>

<p>Providers - Want distance between licensed content and end users decreased.</p>

<p>14.8% of phone ownders use data services (that&#8217;s probably pretty optimistic) Cellular operaters want more users to use data services but adoption has been slow.</p>

<p>Eventually all the providers will be providing the same good enough service,  the differentiating feature will be the applications available.</p>

<p>Multimodal refers mixed voice and text interface. Both for the user input and for the output.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need a PHd in CS any more to develop a voice application.</p>

<p>They provide a markup that allows for voice interaction.</p>

<p>Opera will release a browser with voice capability, version 8 in about a month or so.</p>

<p>Extreme blue, an application they have. A multimodal social mobile service.</p>

<p>Lots of the capabilities are on the device currently (voice generation, voice browser), eventually that might go up to the server.  You can get the components necessary and run them with a relatively generic server architecture.Looks to be application server based (WebSphere, JBoss).  Too bad.</p>

<p>IBM leadership in speech.  More than 30 years. 250 speech patents. 100 researchers in 15 languages.</p>

<p>Speech interface is natural for a phone, people already talk into a phone. They don&#8217;t talk into a computer.</p>

<p>Some comparison with the SALT version from Microsoft, which apparently isn&#8217;t open standards based.</p>

<p>Single word can take you to the point you want. You should be able to just say &#8220;Help&#8221; or &#8220;Customer service&#8221; and get to the point you want.</p>

<p>Eclipse interface, drag and drop, but you can use any text editor to create it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a>  and I are off to New Orleans for a few days.  My cousin is getting married down there, and we&#8217;re extending the trip a bit to do some exploring.  I feel sorry to be leaving the <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> crew when there&#8217;s so much going on. But a promise is a promise, and I promised Elle a vacation in New Orleans.  I could deal with a little bit of rest myself. New Orleans food is good on it&#8217;s own, but we&#8217;ve got the inside track on this one. My cousin the French chef is marrying a pastry chef. Everyone winks and nods when I tell them I&#8217;m going to a wedding between two chefs down in New Orleans. Makes sense that this would be something to behold. I&#8217;ll try to remember to take plenty of pictures.</p>

<p>That said, I still can&#8217;t resist the urge to try out some of my gadgets in new ways.  I picked up a <a href="http://www.delorme.com/bluelogger/">Delorme Bluelogger</a> a while ago, and have fooled around with it to see if I could read out samples over Bluetooth. But this time I actually loaded up a map of New Orleans into my Clie and I&#8217;ll use that to wander around the streets with. Then I thought &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if I could note all the photos I take with my 6600 so I can pin them to a map when I get back?&#8221; I took a quick look around the interweb and didn&#8217;t see anything during my brief search.  If there&#8217;s something out there you know about please leave me a comment. I have Python on my phone, and <a href="http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/miso/">Miso</a> installed already (Miso has a module for taking pictures from within Python scripts). Should be pretty easy to hack up a quick script that takes a picture, samples the GPS, and then writes the image along with some location data to the filesystem. Wish this phone had an airline mode so that I could use it on the plane on the way down. It&#8217;s gonna be a tight squeeze trying to get this working before Elle gets annoyed that I&#8217;m programming and not vacationing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=471">posted about meeting Ewan at ETech</a>. The <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/techconf/2005/03/25/etech-part1/">podcast that he recorded during the ETech conf</a> is up now. It even got <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/24/the_podcast_network_.html">noticed over at BoingBoing</a>, which hopefully means great things for him! Ewan has also started doing <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/rock/2005/03/25/the-rock-show-01/">the Rock show for The Podcast Network</a>. My favorite track off the first edition? Falling as One by <a href="http://www.risetoaddiction.com/news.htm">Rise to Addiction</a>. I love to see RSS used for stuff like this, giving exposure to bands that really want it. Bands that are happy to release their recordings for free in order to gain an audience. It really helps to underscore the fact that protecting the existing recording companies and their contracts is NOT the only way to keep the music industry going. There are other models out there, there are artists not only willing to share, but actively looking for a chance to do so. Ewan is doing a great service by providing these bands a platform from which they can start evolving into the new medium, experimenting with a new way of finding their audience, and providing an introduction in both directions. Keep it coming Ewan!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On my way into work this morning I passed by the Metreon.  The Play Station Portable (PSP) goes on sale tomorrow, and the Metreon will be open at midnight to get the freshest first units into the greedy hands of eagerly awaiting gamers - some of whom were lining up at 11am this morning in perparation for the launch. They had a big PSP hung on the building across the street giving a countdown to the release, and PSP jacketed support staff out on the street.</p>

I completely agree, so I&#8217;m not going to blather on for too long about it. I&#8217;ll just say I agree with a lot of the principles. Protecting people who contribute innovation and keeping their work from getting ripped off - not a bad ideal. But that is not what the current system is doing, so it no longer deserves the respect it once had.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got a note from JD that <a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/03/ourmedia_is_her.html">Ourmedia is live today</a>! The timing is great. There&#8217;s a lot of attention going into podcasting and videoblogging, and I think a free platform for sharable and reusable media could potentially help to shift the attention away from traditional broadcast and into the realm of peer-produced content. Elle and I both helped out on the metadata definition parts during the early stages as well as some early testing (I&#8217;m <a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/7">user number 7</a>). The project is meant to provide a place for people to store the media they want to share with others. Some of the most compelling examples I heard were citizen jounalism and politcal ads. They have both <a href="http://ourmedia.org/videos">video</a> and <a href="http://ourmedia.org/audios">audio</a> content up, and if you sign up for an account you can upload your own. A lot of the ideas that <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Larry Lessig</a> talks about in Free Culture really helped to drive my motivation in paying attention to and helping out with projects like this. Curious what those ideas are?  Check out <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/">a free copy of Free Culture</a> or one of the movies explaining the importance of having works out in public and available for reuse.</p>
