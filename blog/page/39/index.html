  <div class="entry-content"><p>Technorati is hosting a <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000347.html">Developers Salon Kickoff</a> in San Francisco on May 19th. Although it&#8217;s called a &#8220;developers salon&#8221;, it sounds more like an open invitation to both users and developers to come and talk to the team. I&#8217;m going cause it&#8217;s an interesting tool. I like Technorati, but I haven&#8217;t used any of the <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/">development interfaces</a> yet. It&#8217;s normally a good move from the innovative technology standpoint as well. If you have a product or service that does something genuinely new, something that hasn&#8217;t been tried before, it&#8217;s good to take your developers and your users and partners, get them in the same room, and see what happens. The results can be quite surprising. So, I&#8217;m planning to go to observe the interaction as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471237124.html">The Art of Deception</a>, and I probably should have posted about it earlier. I&#8217;ve been involved with computer security for a while, and I&#8217;ve been to a bunch of the more popular security and hacker conferences, which is the reason I&#8217;m giving to myself for the book not making a strong impression immediately. The book is very good, it brings to light many aspects of computer security that even most experts don&#8217;t know about. This should be required reading for anyone involved in computer security. That&#8217;s why I picked it up myself, despite being familiar with many of the tactics and general principles from hanging out at <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a> year after year. So, I&#8217;ve gotten that out of the way, it&#8217;s a good book.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s stuck in my mind however has nothing to do with computer security. The question currently gnawing at me: where does social engineering stop and social/business networking start? Is the difference that the social engineer goes in looking for a particular piece of information? Well, that&#8217;s sometimes how business networking works out. A business development gambit might start out by schmoozing a potential client to find out how to best target the sales pitch. Is it that the social engineer tries to get information they&#8217;re not supposed to have? Well, social networking often involves getting a hold of &#8220;juicy&#8221; information. While that might not necessarily represent restricted info, it could certainly mean information which certain parties might not want widely distributed. And that really does equate to restricted info, just without a written policy. So is the difference that an individual engaged in social networking forms a lasting relationship while a social engineer does not? No, cause social engineers try to form recurring relationships where they can. Leaving themselves routes that they can exploit later to fulfill the same kind of service.</p>

<p>The only difference I can see is that the social engineer does not use their real name, and the social networker does. I was originally going to write that as &#8220;the social engineer normally misrepresents themselves while the social networker does not&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s really true. Especially within the realm of business networking. People normally &#8220;misrepresent themselves&#8221; in terms of attempting to make their company appear more powerful or to make it seem like a fledging deal is further along than it really is. Now, of course, I&#8217;m not saying that most of the people involved in business networking are out to steal information from the people they interact with. I&#8217;m just saying that the two concepts blur together quite contiguously.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s probably quite significant. Cause the premise of the book is that the real action in security doesn&#8217;t revolve around firewalls or intrusion detection systems or encryption or any other technology. The real weakness is in the people using those systems, and transferring information in a way that&#8217;s outside of the normal means of connection. The most &#8220;interesting&#8221; transfers of information are not those that occur along controlled lines, but the transfers which are made because someone is acting in some extraordinary way. But then take that statement and apply it to social networking applications. Do social networking applications really catch the flow of information? Well, if misrepresentation plays a big part, probably not all of it. Of course, I have no idea what percentage of exchanges are genuine and which are influenced at least in part my misinformation, so I&#8217;m not at all prepared to make a blanket statement about the impact. But I will say that years and years of computer security work are starting to result in the realization that human interaction issues dwarf technical risks in terms of the current concerns. Of course, this could be due to years and years worth of computer security work tilted too heavily toward technical issues and ignoring human factors, but that&#8217;s a whole other discussion. I&#8217;ll leave it at saying that if you think that the information you have access to is based &#8220;who you know, and who they have access to&#8221;, I urge you to at least skim through the book and read about some counterexamples. They may happen to be only a small percentage of the cases, but sometimes very interesting information patterns arise when someone is able to identify who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> know them and how to use that to their benefit. There are some spectacular examples, but I think every information transaction is placed somewhere along the line between genuine and false. Even if most transactions are tilted strongly toward genuine, the false aspects of them taken as a whole may be very significant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m about to leave for a two week business trip, so I&#8217;ve been running around all over the place. There hasn&#8217;t been time to read my normal round of feeds, let alone post anything of my own. Sorry about that, but I have to admit it might only get worse over the next few weeks. In the meantime I&#8217;ve been kicking around ideas about what kind of posts I should be putting up here when I do have some time to post again. I really liked doing the longer posts. Sure, they took longer, and sometimes didn&#8217;t work out too well, but they gave me a great chance to reflect deeply on a given topic and polish my writing skills somewhat. The shorter posts were normally just tidbits of info from sources I figured were either very interesting or significantly esoteric. The short bits encouraged me to broaden my reach some. Explore new sources so that I would have something interesting at the end of the day. But I also felt like I was just being a shill for the technology industry as a whole sometimes. And this blog is all about keeping it real. I even made up my own gang sign, cause I&#8217;m just that legit. So I think when I get back to it I&#8217;m gonna try for more of the commentary heavy posts. But all you kids out there in teevee land can lend a hand also. Drop me a line and tell me what you were into, or leave a comment, send a carrier pigeon, whatever. Just don&#8217;t tie a note to a brick and hurl it through my window, I hate it when people do that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to let my geekness shine and provide a pointer to <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2099411/">How to Hack Your Head</a>, an article by Steven Johnson. Steven wrote Interface Culture, a book <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=174">I just recently read and was quite impressed by</a>. His latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743241657/stevenberlinj-20">Mind Wide Open: Your Brian And The Neuroscience of Everyday Life</a>, is currently high on my reading list. The article runs through some existing technologies you can use to get a peek into your brain functioning and mental state. From the sounds of it, direct neural computer interfaces seem to be quite a ways off. Even if you have a few million dollars. Awww man.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Small Business Trends <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/archives/2004_04_01_smallbusinesses_archive.html#108294960642999951">reviews Blog for Business</a>, and in the process drops some great quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Blogs are places where we can stop and reflect. Filter out. Slow down. See a different side of an issue. Get the benefit of someone else&#8217;s thinking, but in a personal way, not just as another place we have to absorb more information. It&#8217;s certainly not a new idea that reading enriches our lives. But blogs are a way we can incorporate reading without having to change what we&#8217;re doing (sitting at the computer) and still enjoy some of the pleasure of conversation (most blogs allow comments if you have the time and the urge). And it&#8217;s that personal touch that makes blogs different from all the other data we must take in.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do blogs HAVE to be personal communications channels? No. Is there something built into the technology which forces them to differ from a frequently updated site using traditional HTML publishing tools? No. But there is a cultural norm at work. Most blogs take the form of personal communication in a voice different than the web content from a few years ago. As a group they present a new trend, causing new interest in a reevaluation of communication style.</p>

<p>As a result perceptions of the nature of online communication are changing. People are seeing for the first time the realization of the &#8220;personal publishing medium&#8221;. This is what the homepage was supposed to provide for people back during the early 90&#8217;s when the web first arrived on the scene. Now, a decade later, blogs are filling the role that the personal homepage was supposed to. What&#8217;s different now? It could simply be that there&#8217;s a critical mass of users online, enough that personal publishers are able to attract a readership that justifies their investment of time. Maybe it&#8217;s that users are now comfortable with the web, and they&#8217;re psychologically ready to make the move from consumer to producer. I&#8217;ve heard others say that it normally takes about 10 years for a technology to hit wide adoption. They use the cell phone as an example. No one is absolutely definite what caused the explosive adoption of cell phones - was it size of the cell network, size and weight of the phones, awareness of the public, etc - but at some point the industry experienced explosive growth. The web is just over 10 years old now. Maybe it&#8217;s just hitting puberty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/archives/000050.html">RSS Neighborhood event on Monday</a>, where Scott Young did a great job guiding a free form discussion about RSS in general. The group was pretty varied, but most had some knowledge about what RSS is already. Some people were looking for the description of what exactly RSS should be used for and how it is different than existing methods, and the group never came to a consensus on that. I personally think that&#8217;s a good thing. RSS is not a technology with existing well defined boundaries. It&#8217;s at the start of adoption for a whole new set of tasks. RSS was originally developed at Netscape to allow embedding headlines from one site into a portal site. We&#8217;re seeing it creep out into new areas of usage. I asked about adoption numbers, how many people read RSS of any sort? The rough response was 1% of the &#8220;internet public&#8221; consume RSS. Bill Flitter is supposed to get back to me with info about where that number came from, I suspect that even that number is somewhat inflated. Other people asked about the format itself, why use RSS instead of other delivery methods? There is no good answer to questions like that. I personally think that RSS is too early in the adoption cycle for us to be able to make predictions about what effect it will have on the enterprise. As such, there is no umbrella answer to when you should abandon other techniques and start looking at RSS. So why bother with talking about RSS at all?</p>

<p>I actually have a couple of answers to that question. I&#8217;ll start with the very simple technical one. The first one is that RSS fits well into the existing web server based application structure. Lets take a look at comparing delivering updates via email with exposing an RSS feed for a blog. With email, first we have to provide a way for users to sign up for the updates, so we probably need an extra form or two, and a data store for those email addresses. Then we need a component that actually delivers email, there are lots and many of them are very well developed, but it&#8217;s still another component which the producer needs to set up. &#8220;So what?&#8221; you say, &#8220;the mail notifications feature should be built into the package I use to publish my blog, I don&#8217;t have to worry about it at all.&#8221; This is the argument that programmers and administrators love to use. But the simple fact is the more interacting components there are to a system, the harder it is to debug. Sometimes the setup might be smooth as silk, but other times a potential new user might be frustrated and just give up. On the other hand, RSS feed generation doesn&#8217;t include any new servers or a new transport protocol. For most setups, producing RSS uses exactly the same underlying services as delivering HTML. It might seem like a stupid minor point, but the net result is that generating RSS is easier for the average producer. And in this new world of peer to peer publishing, with literally hundreds of thousands of content producers, anything we can do to make life simpler for them enjoys a fantastic economy of scale. So one of the geek answers is that delivering RSS shares much of the same infrastructure with delivering HTML. But I think this is really just a minor issue compared to the shift in mindset that has come along with the increased uptake of RSS.</p>

<p>What the hell does that mean? What shift in mindset? That&#8217;s one of those questions that doesn&#8217;t have an absolute answer, yet. But it does seem like people think differently about consuming an RSS feed than they do joining an email list. Is it because they can read feeds apart from their normal email? Or because they don&#8217;t have to give away their address? Or because they can merge posts from feeds and read as a group? Or any of a thousand other differences? At this point no one can say definitively. Will RSS even be the format used for syndication? Also hard to say. Will syndication ever really become widespread? Tough call. It is looking like it eventually will reach a large public user base. And if it does there are some issues that potential producers of feeds should be starting to think about. Issues like how to we control our corporate image? Who should be given the right to produce a feed and who should not? How do we apply a security policy to restrict the flow of information if we do have multiple producers within the organization? All of these are good questions to start asking now. These are the things that should be under consideration.</p>

<p>What I find disturbing is the number of people who are ready to throw themselves on one side or the other. Some people say that RSS is the future, absolutely. Others say that RSS is no different than other technologies, so they shouldn&#8217;t bother. Still others say that RSS is the wrong choice for them because of security concerns or issues of controlling corporate image. The simple truth is that we as technologists do not get to make those choices. A new technology is coming out, and people are starting to use it. Maybe it&#8217;s just a temporary blip, and it never reaches anything but a small percentage of users. But all signs seem to indicate that if it does reach large scale usage it will be a major disruptive force. It brings up a lot of questions that organizations will have a hard time answering. And the best way to answer some of those questions is through experimentation. Should everyone run out right away and setup a mechanism for producing RSS feeds? No, I don&#8217;t think so. But if a large part of your business involves frequent communication with your customers, you should at least be paying attention to the trend and thinking about a pilot program. And if you don&#8217;t fit into that group, at least trying to explore the issues that RSS raises is a start. If RSS does get picked up widely, no amount of arguing that it&#8217;s the wrong method of delivery is going to change the fact that it gets used. The issue isn&#8217;t in finding benefit or flaw in the technology, it&#8217;s in understanding the usage. What does RSS provide users that&#8217;s driving it to the front of discussion? Understand the users and try to do what you can to enhance their experience. If your users want RSS, and your competitor uses RSS, and you have a compelling argument for why RSS sucks, guess who wins? Don&#8217;t fall into the common technologists pitfall of assuming that what&#8217;s best for the computer is best for the system as a whole. What&#8217;s best for the system is what&#8217;s best for the users. If this trend does become a revolution, it might have nothing to do with technology at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Gillmor is <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1380">going to be speaking in Palo Alto on May 20th</a>. This is part of the <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/">SDForum</a> Distinguished Speaker series. All of the speakers I&#8217;ve gone to see before are engineers or business people working in high tech. I&#8217;m very interested in hearing what Dan has to say. In particular it looks like he&#8217;s going to be talking about public authoring:</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens when anyone can make and distribute news to the whole world? In this talk, columnist Dan Gillmor previews a central theme from his upcoming book. the collision of journalism and technology is transforming the roles of newsmakers, reporters, editors, and readers, as the audience becomes an active participant in the news making process.</p></blockquote>

<p>A very cool topic, and certainly a well respected source. If you have the means this is probably going to be a good one to catch. Especially if you&#8217;re interested in blogging and RSS (or syndication formats in general) and are wondering what some of the practical large scale applications of these technologies are. <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan&#8217;s blog</a> is part of my normal reading list, and I&#8217;m definitely interested, so I&#8217;m all registered already. See you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I already posted this in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">linkblog</a>, but I think it deserves another posting. The <a href="http://www.headshift.com/moments/archive/sss2.html">Smarter, Simpler Social</a> essay is outstanding. Not only does it do a great job of laying down and explaining concepts, connecting them together, and giving literally dozens of pointers to other great reading - there&#8217;s also great original editorial commentary in there. Take this quote for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Instead of imposing centralised one-size-fits-all software and then using a combination of coercion and marketing to encourage people to use it, we should be building smaller, more modular and adaptable software services around the very people who will use them, and they should be simple to use, ideally transparent to the user. If we are to exploit the potential of online communication to develop social capital in networks and organisations, then these online applications should aim to augment our social interaction and support our connections with others rather than replace them. In addition to building large, structured online environments where people come together to work, share knowledge and communicate, we need to equip users with the tools required to interact on their own terms, and allow the emergent properties of highly-connected social networks to come into play.</p></blockquote>

<p>I naturally turn this comment toward mobile computing, cause that&#8217;s an area of pretty high interest for me. We&#8217;ve heard statements like that before. What&#8217;s unique about the essay is that it goes on to explain some existing technologies that seem to be working in the right directions, project management considerations, and design movements that seem promising. Extremely enlightening. If you haven&#8217;t already, go read it now. Then take a quick break to grab a snack and a drink, and read it again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve put up a 1.1 release of PalmTorrent at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpalmenv/">the SourceForge site</a>. The app is just a simple application/database downloader for the Palm OS environment. It&#8217;ll download a file over HTTP and give the option of installing it directly onto the handheld, basically providing a way to get content onto your PDA without having to go back to your PC. Just a bunch of minor updates really, save and restore the  URL field, get rid of buttons for functions that aren&#8217;t implemented, stuff like that. The raw .prc file is at Bitsplitter also, at <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc">http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc</a> if you would rather have a URL that you can use directly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/2004/04/23#a12034">entry at Lambda the Ultimate</a> pointing to <a href="http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/talks/jmm2004/">notes from a talk given by Stephen Wolfram</a>. I&#8217;m just skimming through it myself, so I&#8217;m not sure where it eventually ends up :-) But even just some of the information on the first page is worth mention. Almost immediately he starts explaining cellular automaton, and certain automaton that display behavior which seem to display random behavior. The explanations have been amazingly simple and accessible. Peppered throughout the talk are references to <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html">A New Kind of Science</a>, a book with what looks like the full text available online.</p>
