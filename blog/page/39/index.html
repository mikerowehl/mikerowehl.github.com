  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Gillmor is <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1380">going to be speaking in Palo Alto on May 20th</a>. This is part of the <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/">SDForum</a> Distinguished Speaker series. All of the speakers I&#8217;ve gone to see before are engineers or business people working in high tech. I&#8217;m very interested in hearing what Dan has to say. In particular it looks like he&#8217;s going to be talking about public authoring:</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens when anyone can make and distribute news to the whole world? In this talk, columnist Dan Gillmor previews a central theme from his upcoming book. the collision of journalism and technology is transforming the roles of newsmakers, reporters, editors, and readers, as the audience becomes an active participant in the news making process.</p></blockquote>

<p>A very cool topic, and certainly a well respected source. If you have the means this is probably going to be a good one to catch. Especially if you&#8217;re interested in blogging and RSS (or syndication formats in general) and are wondering what some of the practical large scale applications of these technologies are. <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan&#8217;s blog</a> is part of my normal reading list, and I&#8217;m definitely interested, so I&#8217;m all registered already. See you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I already posted this in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">linkblog</a>, but I think it deserves another posting. The <a href="http://www.headshift.com/moments/archive/sss2.html">Smarter, Simpler Social</a> essay is outstanding. Not only does it do a great job of laying down and explaining concepts, connecting them together, and giving literally dozens of pointers to other great reading - there&#8217;s also great original editorial commentary in there. Take this quote for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Instead of imposing centralised one-size-fits-all software and then using a combination of coercion and marketing to encourage people to use it, we should be building smaller, more modular and adaptable software services around the very people who will use them, and they should be simple to use, ideally transparent to the user. If we are to exploit the potential of online communication to develop social capital in networks and organisations, then these online applications should aim to augment our social interaction and support our connections with others rather than replace them. In addition to building large, structured online environments where people come together to work, share knowledge and communicate, we need to equip users with the tools required to interact on their own terms, and allow the emergent properties of highly-connected social networks to come into play.</p></blockquote>

<p>I naturally turn this comment toward mobile computing, cause that&#8217;s an area of pretty high interest for me. We&#8217;ve heard statements like that before. What&#8217;s unique about the essay is that it goes on to explain some existing technologies that seem to be working in the right directions, project management considerations, and design movements that seem promising. Extremely enlightening. If you haven&#8217;t already, go read it now. Then take a quick break to grab a snack and a drink, and read it again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve put up a 1.1 release of PalmTorrent at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpalmenv/">the SourceForge site</a>. The app is just a simple application/database downloader for the Palm OS environment. It&#8217;ll download a file over HTTP and give the option of installing it directly onto the handheld, basically providing a way to get content onto your PDA without having to go back to your PC. Just a bunch of minor updates really, save and restore the  URL field, get rid of buttons for functions that aren&#8217;t implemented, stuff like that. The raw .prc file is at Bitsplitter also, at <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc">http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc</a> if you would rather have a URL that you can use directly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/2004/04/23#a12034">entry at Lambda the Ultimate</a> pointing to <a href="http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/talks/jmm2004/">notes from a talk given by Stephen Wolfram</a>. I&#8217;m just skimming through it myself, so I&#8217;m not sure where it eventually ends up :-) But even just some of the information on the first page is worth mention. Almost immediately he starts explaining cellular automaton, and certain automaton that display behavior which seem to display random behavior. The explanations have been amazingly simple and accessible. Peppered throughout the talk are references to <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html">A New Kind of Science</a>, a book with what looks like the full text available online.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw this linked off of <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Hack the Planet</a>, an online calendaring system called <a href="http://www.washington.edu/ucal/">UW Calendar</a>. It provides for multiple calendars aggregated into a single feed, and is meant to feed data out to all sorts of systems (open source, open standards, yay!!). I need to write a palm application that communicates with this directly, not some sync through a PC hack.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/04/tomorrow_jaron_.html">presentation by Jaron Lanier</a> yesterday and it was very interesting. This <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/aboutfuturesalon.html">Future Salon</a> thing is pretty cool, I&#8217;ll definitely go to more of them. The main thrust of the talk was that there are lots of different &#8220;ramps&#8221; which people can use to judge progress. There&#8217;s a ramp of technology, which progresses from the most basic innovations such as fire and the wheel and moves out to a life that looks something like the Jetsons or something called <a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html">the technological singularity</a>. Of course we&#8217;re not sure exactly where the ramp ends up, which is part of the reason we as humans find satisfaction in advancing it. There&#8217;s also a ramp of morality, starting with brutal kill-or-be-killed life and progressing to some kind of rainbows and sunshine perfect existence.</p>

<p>There are problems with judging progress by these ramps however. The technological ramp leads to greater potential for people to do harm to each other and does nothing to temper that ability. The moral ramp always leads more directly to people killing each other, cause they can never agree on what morality should look like, and they normally don&#8217;t have nice ways to deal with those who don&#8217;t agree. These are gross simplifications of course, Jaron spiced with up with all kinds of witticisms and detailed points and factual tidbits and references to other people&#8217;s work. You can feel free to debate them here. For instance I&#8217;m not sure that I completely agree with the technology ramp leading to greater potential for destruction.. but it doesn&#8217;t much matter. I do agree with his proposed replacement ramp. He says that we should instead be striving for ever increasing levels of interpersonal connection, which he has termed the McLuhan ramp (named after <a href="http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/mcluhan.html">Marshall McLuhan</a>, a very influential figure in the analysis and study of media culture). I think I agree that the McLuhan ramp is probably the best. I think I&#8217;ve actually already gotten on it.</p>

<p>There were a whole bunch of other points in there, such as the effects of learning that there is a difference between reality and fantasy during childhood. The ability of virtual reality to replace that &#8220;godlike&#8221; feeling of power somewhat. And also it&#8217;s ability to replace the need for abstract symbology with the capability to instantiate the idea directly. Given that the human race has come to dominance at least partially due to the ability to transfer thought between generations during our nurtured childhood, replacing the hack that is symbolic language with more direct means could have profound effect. Lots of interesting thoughts kicking around in my head now, but I&#8217;m going to limit it to just the McLuhan ramp for now and let the rest of you mull over that one the way I&#8217;ve been.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After seeing the <a href="http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/Week-of-Mon-20040405/000201.html">interview with Ward Cunningham</a> linked to from <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/04/22/ward_on_social_engineering_in_a_wiki.php">a post in Many2Many</a> I started wandering through the <a href="http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/">archives of the luvly mailing list</a>. There&#8217;s some great stuff in there. For instance an <a href="http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/Week-of-Mon-20040322/000197.html">interview with Lion Kimbro</a>, who has released a book titled <a href="http://speakeasy.org/~lion/nb/">How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought you Think</a>. The book looks great, and it&#8217;s released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">Share Alike Creative Commons license</a>. So of course I had to create <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/Lion_Kimbro_Complete_Map.pdb">a Plucker version</a> so I can read it on the go. Trying to download the pdb file using <a href="http://openpalmenv.sf.net">palm-torrent</a> has exposed some kind of bug there as well.. so I&#8217;m off to try to crush that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3649093.stm">interesting article about researchers using touch to convey text messages</a>. An interesting concept. They call it &#8220;tactile melody&#8221;. I would have called it <a href="http://www.braille.org/">braille</a>. Even though they apparently want to use different movements of pins than the letter combinations used by braille. They probably figure they can convey messages more effectively, requiring less attention from the user and less symbol recognitions. Good for them. I&#8217;m not going to say that I know for sure that they&#8217;re reinventing a number of wheels in unison, but I&#8217;ve got a pretty good feeling that they are. I take this for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can assign a certain tactile melody to my wife and another tactile melody to my daughter,&#8221; said Prof Eckmiller.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;If they send me an SMS, I immediately recognise these melodies, because I selected and generated them myself.&#8221;</p>

<p><sarcasm>Just like I always remember where my car keys are because I put them somewhere myself. Ah yes, infinite customization. The non-existent user requirement every developer loves to foist upon the unsuspecting public.</sarcasm> Or maybe they&#8217;re just talking about using these tactile melodies like ringtones? Could be, but that doesn&#8217;t explain how it would allow for reading messages &#8220;under poor lighting conditions&#8221; in &#8220;total privacy&#8221;. And, of course, they&#8217;ve filed patents. Ensuring that just in case there is a nugget of useful sanity they&#8217;ve generated during the extended dance of tactile plagiarism we&#8217;ll probably have to pay through the nose in order to even consider using it. Yay technology!</p>
