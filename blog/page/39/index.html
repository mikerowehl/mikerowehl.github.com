<blockquote><p>Blogs are places where we can stop and reflect. Filter out. Slow down. See a different side of an issue. Get the benefit of someone else&#8217;s thinking, but in a personal way, not just as another place we have to absorb more information. It&#8217;s certainly not a new idea that reading enriches our lives. But blogs are a way we can incorporate reading without having to change what we&#8217;re doing (sitting at the computer) and still enjoy some of the pleasure of conversation (most blogs allow comments if you have the time and the urge). And it&#8217;s that personal touch that makes blogs different from all the other data we must take in.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do blogs HAVE to be personal communications channels? No. Is there something built into the technology which forces them to differ from a frequently updated site using traditional HTML publishing tools? No. But there is a cultural norm at work. Most blogs take the form of personal communication in a voice different than the web content from a few years ago. As a group they present a new trend, causing new interest in a reevaluation of communication style.</p>

<p>As a result perceptions of the nature of online communication are changing. People are seeing for the first time the realization of the &#8220;personal publishing medium&#8221;. This is what the homepage was supposed to provide for people back during the early 90&#8217;s when the web first arrived on the scene. Now, a decade later, blogs are filling the role that the personal homepage was supposed to. What&#8217;s different now? It could simply be that there&#8217;s a critical mass of users online, enough that personal publishers are able to attract a readership that justifies their investment of time. Maybe it&#8217;s that users are now comfortable with the web, and they&#8217;re psychologically ready to make the move from consumer to producer. I&#8217;ve heard others say that it normally takes about 10 years for a technology to hit wide adoption. They use the cell phone as an example. No one is absolutely definite what caused the explosive adoption of cell phones - was it size of the cell network, size and weight of the phones, awareness of the public, etc - but at some point the industry experienced explosive growth. The web is just over 10 years old now. Maybe it&#8217;s just hitting puberty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/archives/000050.html">RSS Neighborhood event on Monday</a>, where Scott Young did a great job guiding a free form discussion about RSS in general. The group was pretty varied, but most had some knowledge about what RSS is already. Some people were looking for the description of what exactly RSS should be used for and how it is different than existing methods, and the group never came to a consensus on that. I personally think that&#8217;s a good thing. RSS is not a technology with existing well defined boundaries. It&#8217;s at the start of adoption for a whole new set of tasks. RSS was originally developed at Netscape to allow embedding headlines from one site into a portal site. We&#8217;re seeing it creep out into new areas of usage. I asked about adoption numbers, how many people read RSS of any sort? The rough response was 1% of the &#8220;internet public&#8221; consume RSS. Bill Flitter is supposed to get back to me with info about where that number came from, I suspect that even that number is somewhat inflated. Other people asked about the format itself, why use RSS instead of other delivery methods? There is no good answer to questions like that. I personally think that RSS is too early in the adoption cycle for us to be able to make predictions about what effect it will have on the enterprise. As such, there is no umbrella answer to when you should abandon other techniques and start looking at RSS. So why bother with talking about RSS at all?</p>

<p>I actually have a couple of answers to that question. I&#8217;ll start with the very simple technical one. The first one is that RSS fits well into the existing web server based application structure. Lets take a look at comparing delivering updates via email with exposing an RSS feed for a blog. With email, first we have to provide a way for users to sign up for the updates, so we probably need an extra form or two, and a data store for those email addresses. Then we need a component that actually delivers email, there are lots and many of them are very well developed, but it&#8217;s still another component which the producer needs to set up. &#8220;So what?&#8221; you say, &#8220;the mail notifications feature should be built into the package I use to publish my blog, I don&#8217;t have to worry about it at all.&#8221; This is the argument that programmers and administrators love to use. But the simple fact is the more interacting components there are to a system, the harder it is to debug. Sometimes the setup might be smooth as silk, but other times a potential new user might be frustrated and just give up. On the other hand, RSS feed generation doesn&#8217;t include any new servers or a new transport protocol. For most setups, producing RSS uses exactly the same underlying services as delivering HTML. It might seem like a stupid minor point, but the net result is that generating RSS is easier for the average producer. And in this new world of peer to peer publishing, with literally hundreds of thousands of content producers, anything we can do to make life simpler for them enjoys a fantastic economy of scale. So one of the geek answers is that delivering RSS shares much of the same infrastructure with delivering HTML. But I think this is really just a minor issue compared to the shift in mindset that has come along with the increased uptake of RSS.</p>

<p>What the hell does that mean? What shift in mindset? That&#8217;s one of those questions that doesn&#8217;t have an absolute answer, yet. But it does seem like people think differently about consuming an RSS feed than they do joining an email list. Is it because they can read feeds apart from their normal email? Or because they don&#8217;t have to give away their address? Or because they can merge posts from feeds and read as a group? Or any of a thousand other differences? At this point no one can say definitively. Will RSS even be the format used for syndication? Also hard to say. Will syndication ever really become widespread? Tough call. It is looking like it eventually will reach a large public user base. And if it does there are some issues that potential producers of feeds should be starting to think about. Issues like how to we control our corporate image? Who should be given the right to produce a feed and who should not? How do we apply a security policy to restrict the flow of information if we do have multiple producers within the organization? All of these are good questions to start asking now. These are the things that should be under consideration.</p>

<p>What I find disturbing is the number of people who are ready to throw themselves on one side or the other. Some people say that RSS is the future, absolutely. Others say that RSS is no different than other technologies, so they shouldn&#8217;t bother. Still others say that RSS is the wrong choice for them because of security concerns or issues of controlling corporate image. The simple truth is that we as technologists do not get to make those choices. A new technology is coming out, and people are starting to use it. Maybe it&#8217;s just a temporary blip, and it never reaches anything but a small percentage of users. But all signs seem to indicate that if it does reach large scale usage it will be a major disruptive force. It brings up a lot of questions that organizations will have a hard time answering. And the best way to answer some of those questions is through experimentation. Should everyone run out right away and setup a mechanism for producing RSS feeds? No, I don&#8217;t think so. But if a large part of your business involves frequent communication with your customers, you should at least be paying attention to the trend and thinking about a pilot program. And if you don&#8217;t fit into that group, at least trying to explore the issues that RSS raises is a start. If RSS does get picked up widely, no amount of arguing that it&#8217;s the wrong method of delivery is going to change the fact that it gets used. The issue isn&#8217;t in finding benefit or flaw in the technology, it&#8217;s in understanding the usage. What does RSS provide users that&#8217;s driving it to the front of discussion? Understand the users and try to do what you can to enhance their experience. If your users want RSS, and your competitor uses RSS, and you have a compelling argument for why RSS sucks, guess who wins? Don&#8217;t fall into the common technologists pitfall of assuming that what&#8217;s best for the computer is best for the system as a whole. What&#8217;s best for the system is what&#8217;s best for the users. If this trend does become a revolution, it might have nothing to do with technology at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Gillmor is <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1380">going to be speaking in Palo Alto on May 20th</a>. This is part of the <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/">SDForum</a> Distinguished Speaker series. All of the speakers I&#8217;ve gone to see before are engineers or business people working in high tech. I&#8217;m very interested in hearing what Dan has to say. In particular it looks like he&#8217;s going to be talking about public authoring:</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens when anyone can make and distribute news to the whole world? In this talk, columnist Dan Gillmor previews a central theme from his upcoming book. the collision of journalism and technology is transforming the roles of newsmakers, reporters, editors, and readers, as the audience becomes an active participant in the news making process.</p></blockquote>

<p>A very cool topic, and certainly a well respected source. If you have the means this is probably going to be a good one to catch. Especially if you&#8217;re interested in blogging and RSS (or syndication formats in general) and are wondering what some of the practical large scale applications of these technologies are. <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan&#8217;s blog</a> is part of my normal reading list, and I&#8217;m definitely interested, so I&#8217;m all registered already. See you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I already posted this in the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">linkblog</a>, but I think it deserves another posting. The <a href="http://www.headshift.com/moments/archive/sss2.html">Smarter, Simpler Social</a> essay is outstanding. Not only does it do a great job of laying down and explaining concepts, connecting them together, and giving literally dozens of pointers to other great reading - there&#8217;s also great original editorial commentary in there. Take this quote for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Instead of imposing centralised one-size-fits-all software and then using a combination of coercion and marketing to encourage people to use it, we should be building smaller, more modular and adaptable software services around the very people who will use them, and they should be simple to use, ideally transparent to the user. If we are to exploit the potential of online communication to develop social capital in networks and organisations, then these online applications should aim to augment our social interaction and support our connections with others rather than replace them. In addition to building large, structured online environments where people come together to work, share knowledge and communicate, we need to equip users with the tools required to interact on their own terms, and allow the emergent properties of highly-connected social networks to come into play.</p></blockquote>

<p>I naturally turn this comment toward mobile computing, cause that&#8217;s an area of pretty high interest for me. We&#8217;ve heard statements like that before. What&#8217;s unique about the essay is that it goes on to explain some existing technologies that seem to be working in the right directions, project management considerations, and design movements that seem promising. Extremely enlightening. If you haven&#8217;t already, go read it now. Then take a quick break to grab a snack and a drink, and read it again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve put up a 1.1 release of PalmTorrent at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpalmenv/">the SourceForge site</a>. The app is just a simple application/database downloader for the Palm OS environment. It&#8217;ll download a file over HTTP and give the option of installing it directly onto the handheld, basically providing a way to get content onto your PDA without having to go back to your PC. Just a bunch of minor updates really, save and restore the  URL field, get rid of buttons for functions that aren&#8217;t implemented, stuff like that. The raw .prc file is at Bitsplitter also, at <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc">http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc</a> if you would rather have a URL that you can use directly.</p>

I&#8217;m just skimming through it myself, so I&#8217;m not sure where it eventually ends up :-) But even just some of the information on the first page is worth mention. Almost immediately he starts explaining cellular automaton, and certain automaton that display behavior which seem to display random behavior. The explanations have been amazingly simple and accessible.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/04/tomorrow_jaron_.html">presentation by Jaron Lanier</a> yesterday and it was very interesting. This <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/aboutfuturesalon.html">Future Salon</a> thing is pretty cool, I&#8217;ll definitely go to more of them. The main thrust of the talk was that there are lots of different &#8220;ramps&#8221; which people can use to judge progress. There&#8217;s a ramp of technology, which progresses from the most basic innovations such as fire and the wheel and moves out to a life that looks something like the Jetsons or something called <a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html">the technological singularity</a>. Of course we&#8217;re not sure exactly where the ramp ends up, which is part of the reason we as humans find satisfaction in advancing it. There&#8217;s also a ramp of morality, starting with brutal kill-or-be-killed life and progressing to some kind of rainbows and sunshine perfect existence.</p>

<p>There are problems with judging progress by these ramps however. The technological ramp leads to greater potential for people to do harm to each other and does nothing to temper that ability. The moral ramp always leads more directly to people killing each other, cause they can never agree on what morality should look like, and they normally don&#8217;t have nice ways to deal with those who don&#8217;t agree. These are gross simplifications of course, Jaron spiced with up with all kinds of witticisms and detailed points and factual tidbits and references to other people&#8217;s work. You can feel free to debate them here. For instance I&#8217;m not sure that I completely agree with the technology ramp leading to greater potential for destruction.. but it doesn&#8217;t much matter. I do agree with his proposed replacement ramp. He says that we should instead be striving for ever increasing levels of interpersonal connection, which he has termed the McLuhan ramp (named after <a href="http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/mcluhan.html">Marshall McLuhan</a>, a very influential figure in the analysis and study of media culture). I think I agree that the McLuhan ramp is probably the best. I think I&#8217;ve actually already gotten on it.</p>

<p>There were a whole bunch of other points in there, such as the effects of learning that there is a difference between reality and fantasy during childhood. The ability of virtual reality to replace that &#8220;godlike&#8221; feeling of power somewhat. And also it&#8217;s ability to replace the need for abstract symbology with the capability to instantiate the idea directly. Given that the human race has come to dominance at least partially due to the ability to transfer thought between generations during our nurtured childhood, replacing the hack that is symbolic language with more direct means could have profound effect. Lots of interesting thoughts kicking around in my head now, but I&#8217;m going to limit it to just the McLuhan ramp for now and let the rest of you mull over that one the way I&#8217;ve been.</p>
