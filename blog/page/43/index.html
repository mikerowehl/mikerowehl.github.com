  <div class="entry-content"><p>Edd Dumbill <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2004/03/24-gnome-doc/read">posted his take on the next steps for GNOME</a>. There&#8217;s been a debate going on about the future direction for the project, I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=199">posted a few links</a> a little while ago myself. I have some points that I want to throw in myself, cause I somewhat disagree with Edd. I agree with his points in general - that better documentation and IDEs will go a long way to getting the Linux desktop adopted as a platform of choice. But I think that the techniques proposed would also go a long way toward destroying the platform. I want to address this issue right off:</p>

<blockquote><p>Microsoft&#8217;s genius is in enabling the hoardes of mediocre programmers who just do their job from 9 &#8216;til 5 each day. GNOME&#8217;s weakness is in only making developer tools for core GNOME hackers: if you really want to find out how to code for GNOME, you must enter the inner circle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now it&#8217;s true that this reduces the number of people who develop for GNOME, but it also means that the average skill level of the developers is higher. I think this is actually an important control mechanism within open source projects. Just like in evolution, sometimes there are sets of attributes that just don&#8217;t work out. Open source projects work along a set of rules that seems very similar. Some developers just don&#8217;t have the right set of skills and motivation in order to work with the project as a whole. The correct answer isn&#8217;t to lower the bar for them however. All that would happen is that you would end up with a polluted project. The core developers would have less time to work on what they need to get done because they&#8217;re helping newbies and trying to clean up crappy code that got into the code base.</p>

<p>To see an example of how this works out correctly, just look at the core Linux kernel development team. Many people describe that group as a gruff and rather uncompromising band of elitists. But the project keeps going and the output keeps getting better and better. Their personal demand for excellence is what ensures that the overall project maintains the required degree of quality. Does that mean that sometimes someone with a good idea but without the ability to implement it gets ignored? At times, yes. But if the idea was really necessary, it will eventually get picked up by someone with the right set of skills to take it to completion. It sounds rude, and maybe a bit brutal, but it&#8217;s a system that works. And given the distributed nature of these projects, and the fact that the projects are really kept alive by the sum of individual motivations, diluting the core group is a very dangerous proposition.</p>

<p>I think the ideas that Edd lays out are good ideas in general. I just think that the core team should be left to develop as kick ass of a desktop system as they can (I refer back to a <a href="http://ometer.com/desktop-language.html">post by Havoc Pennington</a> for the initial motivations myself). And if there&#8217;s also a goal to take the Kick Ass Linux Desktop Environment and make it more accessible to the average developer that should be another project. Just like the way that the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/docs.html">Linux Documentation Project</a> is not the same as the <a href="http://www.kernel.org">Linux Kernel Project</a>, I don&#8217;t think that making the desktop system more accessible to the average user fits well with the role of the core technology developers. I think that providing a resource for GNOME which fills the documentation role as well as MSDN does would call for providing a lot of general background info. The resource would need to describe not just how the technology works, but general high level concepts, the motivations for certain design decisions, and common usage patterns. The same thing goes for development tools such as IDEs and interfaces for high level languages. Maybe this means that the developers of the documentation and user tools have to do some extra running around in order to track down the rapidly evolving system&#8230; But if they give up because they can&#8217;t do it that means it&#8217;s not yet time for it to be attempted. To burden the core developers with the additional role of increasing accessibility would only end up coupling the two tasks. If the documentation part fails it risks bringing down the whole desktop project. But if we let the geeks run off and make a kick ass core system, and just let them do their thing, they are more likely to succeed. It might take us two, or three, or three dozen attempts to figure out how to bring that desktop system to the masses. But at least if they develop the system we know what we&#8217;re working toward, and we have a working system while we do it.</p>

Certainly sounds kick ass, and it&#8217;s in Tahoe, and there&#8217;s a three day open bar, and people all over the place with computers and network access. See, I&#8217;m getting excited already and the conf is still six months off. Pre-reg ends in just a few days however.. although I&#8217;m not sure what that means exactly. What happens after pre-reg ends? Hard to say, so I just registered. Probably not the smartest way to handle it. But then again spending three days at an open bar with a bunch of geeks isn&#8217;t exactly a safe diversion either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Textually.com <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/003405.htm">reports on a new interactive billboard installed by Yahoo! to promote their reworked auto site</a>. The <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/creative/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000471117">full article is at AdWeek</a>, but it does little to answer my main question. The sign looks like a pretty cool idea. It&#8217;ll certainly attract some attention, and it&#8217;s novel enough that people might visit it just to see how it comes off. But there are mentions of RFIB in both the excerpt and in the longer article. How is RFIB being used for the Yahoo! application? I get the impression it isn&#8217;t being used at all. It seems like it&#8217;s just something that the sign maker wants to pimp:</p>

<blockquote><p>The company&#8217;s sign technology, called RFIB and similar to toll roads&#8217; Easy-Pass systems, could be expanded to customized billboards in the near future, according to John Mayo-Smith, vice president of technology at R/GA. For example, a digital billboard might be programmed to have a different image depending on whether a car or a motorcycle passed it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hmm.. interesting technology to drag out during the International Automotive Show. Are they there to try to get manufacturers to embed RFIB tags in new models so that advertising can be targeted at vehicles as they pass? Makes too much sense to be ignored. With everyone screaming about RFID being used in retail locations for the items they&#8217;re purchasing, I can&#8217;t see anyone being to happy about getting a tracking device embedded in their vehicle. Passive RFID tags work over VERY short range (for most of the tags being used in retail applications, about 1 meter), however the EZpass style tags work over much longer range. And if they&#8217;re talking about using a read from the tag to drive a creative on a sign by the side of the road, I have to imagine that the read range is measured in tens of meters.</p>

<p>So what exactly is RFIB? A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=RFIB&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Google search for the term &#8220;RFIB&#8221;</a> yeilded nothing that seemed to be related. The <a href="http://www.rga.com">R/GA corporate website</a>, a flash site with no alternative view that I could find, yeilded no useful info. There might be some info in there, but there&#8217;s no search function and the site is structured to assure that no external searches work. If you want a nefarious tracking application to rally against, I would pick this one. That said, I still think the interactive billboard is a pretty cool idea. I&#8217;m just not sure that I like the RFIB aspect of it. Especially if someone is out there lobbying automakers to install it without making any of the details public.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across two computer programming books with their full text available online: <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-1.html">Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days</a> and <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. I&#8217;ve only skimmed through each of them very briefly, but I personally am going to start on the teach yourself Scheme book. While I am a pretty hard core geek, I do know that I&#8217;m pretty far behind the curve in terms of the Scheme style of programming. Unfortunately there are a lot of programmers who never realize when they&#8217;re in similar situations. Learning new techniques shouldn&#8217;t stop when you get your degree or certification. So if you&#8217;re a professional programmer I urge you to at least take a look over this stuff, especially if you&#8217;re not familiar with functional programming. I know most will look over at the books and say something like &#8220;this is dumb, my language can do all of this stuff much more easily.&#8221; Resist that urge. For those of us who come from an imperitive or object oriented background (C, C++, Pascal, Java, etc) there is a bunch to be learned from the style. What got me to go back and look at the stuff was <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">an article by Paul Graham about using Lisp for web programming</a>. In the article he quotes Eric Raymond:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that statement to be eerily accurate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I got my new <a href="http://www.technorati.com/profile/miker">Technorati Profile</a> kicking, and I&#8217;m feeling pretty spiffy. But I notice that when I upload a picture it&#8217;s all smushed and mangled, and that I can&#8217;t remove the image so I just have to put up one of Ed instead, and that their javascript inclusion snippet isn&#8217;t valid XHTML. So out it comes again, and I shove back in some corrected XHTML, but this time without the image. Hopefully that won&#8217;t screw things up. I emailed feedback, we&#8217;ll see what they have to say about my oddball requests. Overall, it&#8217;s not that big of a deal. I claimed the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/">Link Blog</a> also, and while I was at it realized that thing is nowhere near XHTML. So I guess I got something to do tomorrow as well.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the deal with Technorati, cause I shouldn&#8217;t assume everyone knows about these things. <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> is a website that keeps track of which blogs are linking to which other blogs, which is cool for blog writers cause we&#8217;re frequently wondering about who is paying attention to the stuff we&#8217;re writing. From what I&#8217;ve been able to tell so far, Technorati seems to watch the blog update ping services like <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">Weblogs.com</a> and <a href="http://blo.gs/">blo.gs</a> to find the list of blogs to parse. I&#8217;m assuming this cause I know of a few blogs that have linked to Bitsplitter, but I don&#8217;t see on my inbound links list. When I asked the authors, they all said they didn&#8217;t ping weblogs.com or any other service. So, that&#8217;s something to keep in mind if you have a blog and you would like to bootstrap it into the larger world. It seems like those weblog change posting services have so many links that no one would notice your update anyway, but they&#8217;re not just for human use apparently. Pinging the update services will also get your link into services like Technorati and news aggregator services. That&#8217;s my tip for the day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And here you have it, the updated Bitsplitter Blog. The minimalist view is still the default, but now featuring such coolness as <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitsplitter.net%2Fblog%2F">valid XHTML</a>, <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/">valid CSS</a>, and a <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitsplitter.net%2Fblog%2Fwp-rss2.php">valid RSS2 feed</a>. And this time instead of destroying the normal setup, I left the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/desktop.php">desktop version available</a> as well. So those of you who are into that kind of thing should be made a little happier.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=204">test posting from Vagablog</a> worked, but I got the standard XML declaration error instead of a success message. It turns out that this has been fixed for real in CVS for <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, but the 1.0.2 version still barfs some stuff that it shouldn&#8217;t into the XMLRPC output. If you want to fix it on your own, and you know what you&#8217;re doing, find the wp_set_post_cats() function in xmlrpc.php. Go to the part that reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>// First the old categories
$old_categories = $wpdb->get_col(&#8220;SELECT category_id FROM $tablepost2cat WHERE post_id = $post_ID&#8221;);</p></blockquote>

<p>Just after the assignment of $old_categories add the lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>if ( !isset( $old_categories ) ) {
$old_categories = array();
}</p></blockquote>

<p>That should take care of it for now. The 1.0.3 release should have the fixes from CVS, so that should be the last of that issue.</p>
