  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a decent amount of discussion about prototype based programming lately, with two new projects called <a href="http://www.prothon.org/">Prothon</a> and <a href="http://slate.tunes.org/">Slate</a> getting most of the press. So all of this gets the question, what the hell is a prototype based programming language? There&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_based">definition in the Wikipedia</a> which can shed a bit of light on it. The <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/papers/self-power.html">description of Self</a> from the Self site gets a bit heady, but their explanation of the fundamental nature of message passing and the benefits provided in terms of maintenance are worth the time. If you&#8217;re looking for a really quick description check out the <a href="http://www.prothon.org/description.htm">Prothon description</a>. Or go searching through the resources for any of the <a href="http://www.dekorte.com/Proto/Chart.html">other prototype based languages</a>.. there seem to be quite a few. Most of them I&#8217;ve never even heard of.</p>

<p>My main question is why is there a sudden surge in interest for these languages? Are people just now coming to see the benefits? I hadn&#8217;t heard of prototype based objects before, so maybe the concepts just got laid in front of the right people at the right time. Self seems to be a very young system, so maybe the concepts weren&#8217;t well explored yet. But given the capabilities of the systems, such as being able to change behavior of objects &#8220;on the fly&#8221; and the ability to include active variables implicitly (see the Self paper for why this is), I&#8217;m wondering if the interest stems somewhat from the System Oriented Architecture and Web Services pushes going on. When your business process becomes an always on application of distributed objects you have a strong motivator to search for the ultimate runtime flexibility so you can fix problems with the system still up and running. Just a thought. To me it seems there&#8217;s a very good match there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I forget how I ended up there, but I was reading Michael Sippey&#8217;s post <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/03/timeline.html">about keeping a timeline of major events for the year</a>. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sippey.com/timeline/">an example at his site</a>. I like it. There should be tools to handle these formats for the Palm platform. Open source tools. When I run across an iCal file online I should be able to add it DIRECTLY to my Palm, not just setup a desktop app that can sync it over. Ditto for RSS and Atom feeds. There should be an open source datebook app that supports calendar layering. And a feed reader. At the minimum. There should be a full Atom interface application, but a feed reader would be a nice start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Feature has <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100482&amp;ref=716084">an article about location based services being deployed and experimented with today</a>. It includes a pointer to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1176995,00.html">an article in The Guardian</a> with information about <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=201">Urban Tapestries</a> and <a href="http://www.nfc-forum.org/">Near Field Communication</a>. I had heard that NFC was a combined project to form an open platform for location based services, but I didn&#8217;t know much detail. This is from the article in The Guardian:</p>

<blockquote><p>Philips and Sony say: &#8220;NFC can be used for quickly establishing other types of wireless communication between devices, acting as a virtual connector. By bringing two devices into close vicinity, it can invisibly configure and initialise other wireless protocols such as Bluetooth and 802.11 (eg Wi-Fi), enabling devices to communicate at longer ranges or transfer data at higher rates. In an environment rich with wireless-enabled devices, it&#8217;s the easy way to set up connections without needing to go through complicated menus.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting, I had never heard it described that way. I wonder if that&#8217;s really the main direction the forum is looking at. I know the the RFID people are <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0121943/2004/02/04.html">considering using either EPC or IPV6</a> as their lookup system. I wonder how this would fit into that scheme in general. Complementary? Opposing? I think location based services kick ass, and I think they would provide a lot of value to end users and generate some really innovative applications in general. But I&#8217;m very concerned that the underlying technologies don&#8217;t seem to cary the level of openness I would like to see. In order to see location based services take off, it&#8217;s not going to be enough to provide a few standards that telcom providers can roll out when they see fit. Most telcom providers will never see fit unless there&#8217;s immediate money to be made. What&#8217;s needed is a completely open platform which can be deployed despite and around other major impediments, without any infrastructure changes. That&#8217;s the impression I got from the NFC site, that it&#8217;s the kind of tech that could be deployed now. Handsets would need some extra  functions, servers would need to be made available. But it&#8217;s not the type of thing that would require replacing or reprogramming service side equiptment. For instance I remember a lot of  talk about the Enhanced 911 service for cell phones leading to location based services.. but as far I know know it&#8217;s either difficult of impossible to get that information from providers. It&#8217;s my hope the NFC will provide a way to avoid those kinds of issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to reading <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">Small Pieces Loosely Joined</a> as a whole. It&#8217;s one of those books that I&#8217;ve heard so much about and read so many quotes from that I felt like I would already have a good feel for what it was really about. But once I started reading it I realized it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s good just because it&#8217;s insightful, but because everyone sees issues relevant to their own point of view. So of course now I feel like a wonk for not having read it sooner. I should have known I was in for something different when the book started going into a description of all kinds of mapping efforts for the Internet. I&#8217;m sitting in my home office, the walls covered with the <a href="http://www.lumeta.com/news/pressreleases.php?pr_ID=10">poster versions of the Cheswick maps</a> from three years and with a copy of the <a href="http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/atlas.html">Atlas of Cyberspace</a> sitting on my table, and I&#8217;m reading a book that starts out with a description of space as applied to the Internet. It gave me this sense of personal connection with the material, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that just about everyone who reads it and has spent time on the Internet will see something of themselves in some part of it. That&#8217;s probably why David Weinberger did such a great job of pulling together a unified theory of the Internet. He seems to inherently understand the duality of mass communication and personal address. The book comes off excellently, and to the other people out there who might be thinking &#8220;Oh yea, I&#8217;ve heard about that book a thousand times, I know what it&#8217;s all about.&#8221; I encourage you to go pick up a copy anyway. Even if you do know all the major subject topics, there&#8217;s a lot to be learned from the nuance and presentation as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Edd Dumbill <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2004/03/24-gnome-doc/read">posted his take on the next steps for GNOME</a>. There&#8217;s been a debate going on about the future direction for the project, I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=199">posted a few links</a> a little while ago myself. I have some points that I want to throw in myself, cause I somewhat disagree with Edd. I agree with his points in general - that better documentation and IDEs will go a long way to getting the Linux desktop adopted as a platform of choice. But I think that the techniques proposed would also go a long way toward destroying the platform. I want to address this issue right off:</p>

<blockquote><p>Microsoft&#8217;s genius is in enabling the hoardes of mediocre programmers who just do their job from 9 &#8216;til 5 each day. GNOME&#8217;s weakness is in only making developer tools for core GNOME hackers: if you really want to find out how to code for GNOME, you must enter the inner circle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now it&#8217;s true that this reduces the number of people who develop for GNOME, but it also means that the average skill level of the developers is higher. I think this is actually an important control mechanism within open source projects. Just like in evolution, sometimes there are sets of attributes that just don&#8217;t work out. Open source projects work along a set of rules that seems very similar. Some developers just don&#8217;t have the right set of skills and motivation in order to work with the project as a whole. The correct answer isn&#8217;t to lower the bar for them however. All that would happen is that you would end up with a polluted project. The core developers would have less time to work on what they need to get done because they&#8217;re helping newbies and trying to clean up crappy code that got into the code base.</p>

<p>To see an example of how this works out correctly, just look at the core Linux kernel development team. Many people describe that group as a gruff and rather uncompromising band of elitists. But the project keeps going and the output keeps getting better and better. Their personal demand for excellence is what ensures that the overall project maintains the required degree of quality. Does that mean that sometimes someone with a good idea but without the ability to implement it gets ignored? At times, yes. But if the idea was really necessary, it will eventually get picked up by someone with the right set of skills to take it to completion. It sounds rude, and maybe a bit brutal, but it&#8217;s a system that works. And given the distributed nature of these projects, and the fact that the projects are really kept alive by the sum of individual motivations, diluting the core group is a very dangerous proposition.</p>

<p>I think the ideas that Edd lays out are good ideas in general. I just think that the core team should be left to develop as kick ass of a desktop system as they can (I refer back to a <a href="http://ometer.com/desktop-language.html">post by Havoc Pennington</a> for the initial motivations myself). And if there&#8217;s also a goal to take the Kick Ass Linux Desktop Environment and make it more accessible to the average developer that should be another project. Just like the way that the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/docs.html">Linux Documentation Project</a> is not the same as the <a href="http://www.kernel.org">Linux Kernel Project</a>, I don&#8217;t think that making the desktop system more accessible to the average user fits well with the role of the core technology developers. I think that providing a resource for GNOME which fills the documentation role as well as MSDN does would call for providing a lot of general background info. The resource would need to describe not just how the technology works, but general high level concepts, the motivations for certain design decisions, and common usage patterns. The same thing goes for development tools such as IDEs and interfaces for high level languages. Maybe this means that the developers of the documentation and user tools have to do some extra running around in order to track down the rapidly evolving system&#8230; But if they give up because they can&#8217;t do it that means it&#8217;s not yet time for it to be attempted. To burden the core developers with the additional role of increasing accessibility would only end up coupling the two tasks. If the documentation part fails it risks bringing down the whole desktop project. But if we let the geeks run off and make a kick ass core system, and just let them do their thing, they are more likely to succeed. It might take us two, or three, or three dozen attempts to figure out how to bring that desktop system to the masses. But at least if they develop the system we know what we&#8217;re working toward, and we have a working system while we do it.</p>

Certainly sounds kick ass, and it&#8217;s in Tahoe, and there&#8217;s a three day open bar, and people all over the place with computers and network access. See, I&#8217;m getting excited already and the conf is still six months off. Pre-reg ends in just a few days however.. although I&#8217;m not sure what that means exactly. What happens after pre-reg ends? Hard to say, so I just registered. Probably not the smartest way to handle it. But then again spending three days at an open bar with a bunch of geeks isn&#8217;t exactly a safe diversion either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Textually.com <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/003405.htm">reports on a new interactive billboard installed by Yahoo! to promote their reworked auto site</a>. The <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/creative/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000471117">full article is at AdWeek</a>, but it does little to answer my main question. The sign looks like a pretty cool idea. It&#8217;ll certainly attract some attention, and it&#8217;s novel enough that people might visit it just to see how it comes off. But there are mentions of RFIB in both the excerpt and in the longer article. How is RFIB being used for the Yahoo! application? I get the impression it isn&#8217;t being used at all. It seems like it&#8217;s just something that the sign maker wants to pimp:</p>

<blockquote><p>The company&#8217;s sign technology, called RFIB and similar to toll roads&#8217; Easy-Pass systems, could be expanded to customized billboards in the near future, according to John Mayo-Smith, vice president of technology at R/GA. For example, a digital billboard might be programmed to have a different image depending on whether a car or a motorcycle passed it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hmm.. interesting technology to drag out during the International Automotive Show. Are they there to try to get manufacturers to embed RFIB tags in new models so that advertising can be targeted at vehicles as they pass? Makes too much sense to be ignored. With everyone screaming about RFID being used in retail locations for the items they&#8217;re purchasing, I can&#8217;t see anyone being to happy about getting a tracking device embedded in their vehicle. Passive RFID tags work over VERY short range (for most of the tags being used in retail applications, about 1 meter), however the EZpass style tags work over much longer range. And if they&#8217;re talking about using a read from the tag to drive a creative on a sign by the side of the road, I have to imagine that the read range is measured in tens of meters.</p>

<p>So what exactly is RFIB? A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=RFIB&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Google search for the term &#8220;RFIB&#8221;</a> yeilded nothing that seemed to be related. The <a href="http://www.rga.com">R/GA corporate website</a>, a flash site with no alternative view that I could find, yeilded no useful info. There might be some info in there, but there&#8217;s no search function and the site is structured to assure that no external searches work. If you want a nefarious tracking application to rally against, I would pick this one. That said, I still think the interactive billboard is a pretty cool idea. I&#8217;m just not sure that I like the RFIB aspect of it. Especially if someone is out there lobbying automakers to install it without making any of the details public.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across two computer programming books with their full text available online: <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-1.html">Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days</a> and <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>.

While I am a pretty hard core geek, I do know that I&#8217;m pretty far behind the curve in terms of the Scheme style of programming. Unfortunately there are a lot of programmers who never realize when they&#8217;re in similar situations. Learning new techniques shouldn&#8217;t stop when you get your degree or certification. So if you&#8217;re a professional programmer I urge you to at least take a look over this stuff, especially if you&#8217;re not familiar with functional programming. I know most will look over at the books and say something like &#8220;this is dumb, my language can do all of this stuff much more easily.&#8221; Resist that urge. For those of us who come from an imperitive or object oriented background (C, C++, Pascal, Java, etc) there is a bunch to be learned from the style. What got me to go back and look at the stuff was <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">an article by Paul Graham about using Lisp for web programming</a>. In the article he quotes Eric Raymond:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that statement to be eerily accurate.</p>
