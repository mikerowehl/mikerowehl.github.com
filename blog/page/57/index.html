  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mobile computing site <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php">MyPalmLife</a> has moved to its new home. Along with the new look, there are user forums as well. There&#8217;s usually quite a bit of interesting information there, and there are going to be three posters for the blog so that&#8217;ll probably even increase some. I particularly like that the site isn&#8217;t just a bunch of Palm fan-boy postings. There&#8217;s a decent amount of bitching about how lame Palm devices can be and how companies just can&#8217;t seem to fulfill their promises. Makes me feel like I&#8217;m not quite so alone in my pissing and whining.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just met with Dave from Wireless Ink just a few days ago, so I admit I had a tip off to look for some interesting news from them. They&#8217;ve just announced that they&#8217;ve added <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?article_level1_id=177">Howard Rheingold</a> and <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?article_level1_id=176">Adam Greenfield</a> to their Advisory Board. I would be happy just to get a few minutes to talk to either of those guys. Adding people like this to the board is a strong move, and a hefty endorsement for Wireless Ink. Congratulations to the Wireless Ink team! I&#8217;ll be looking forward to seeing what the new year has in store.</p>

<p>On a more Bitsplitter specific note, I&#8217;ve been working on setting up <a href="http://winksite.com/">WINKsite</a> mobile versions of a couple of projects I&#8217;ve been working on. I&#8217;ve been cranking away on them since I got back from NY, but they&#8217;re still nowhere near ready. I&#8217;ll let you know when they&#8217;re live and kicking. As usual, I&#8217;ve probably bitten off way more than I can chew&#8230;. but hopefully at least one of them will see the light of day :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=6385">an article at PalmInfocenter.com</a> about <a href="http://www.pdaportal.us/">PDAPortal.us</a>. PDAPortal is a collection of sites with content formatted in a way that displays well on PDA screens. Very convenient. I&#8217;ll have to try using this portal to look for sites instead of using the <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/hacking/palm/plucker-summaries.html">scripts I was using to massage content into a format that looked decent in Plucker</a>. These sites can either be used to suck up for offline viewing or read directly online. I&#8217;ve really had a hard time finding sites that I can view directly from my handheld, so this should be really cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had commenting turned off by default, but I&#8217;ve decided to turn it on for a while and see what happens. I had it off originally because there seem to be so many problems with blog spam. But there seem to be quite a few people reading now, and I haven&#8217;t been getting trackback links. So now you readers have the option of commenting directly. Especially those of you who use <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>, I would like to offer you a way to feedback on the changes and offer suggestions when I throw up mobile computing news articles. So, hopefully this will work out. I look forward to hearing from you, and hopefully this will offer an opportunity for some of you to get to know each other directly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-5.0.html">alpha release of MySQL 5.0</a> available. I haven&#8217;t tried it out yet, but I use MySQL quite a bit, so I&#8217;ll hop on this one pretty soon. This new release includes support for stored procedures, which is one of the commonly sighted shortfalls of MySQL according to business users. The companies I work with are normally very heavily pro-MySQL, although some do still use Oracle for special requirements. Hopefully this new release will cover some of those corner cases and allow MySQL to expand into even more areas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just signed up for the <a href="https://www.vlab.org/204.cfm?eventID=40">Existing Opportunities in the Security Market</a> event being held over at Stanford. The bullet list of topics for the discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are there still untapped opportunities in the information security market?</p></li>
<li><p>What does the move toward a risk mitigation-based ROI approach mean for security vendors?</p></li>
<li><p>How do corporate security officers and IT directors assess risk within their own IT environments?</p></li>
<li><p>What role do IT security products play in overall enterprise risk management?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It sounds like it could be pretty interesting. I did work for a while as the security manager for a pretty large startup down in Passadena, and I learned a hell of a lot in the process. Even among the most competent and insightful of the information technology workers, security is something of a black art. I think a lot of the issues stem from security directly straddling both financial and information technology roles. This is true with just about any technology work, but I see it most pronounced with security. Most people still start their security work at the &#8220;how can I secure this system?&#8221; question. When in actuality the first security question should be something along the lines of &#8220;what is the risk of running this system and how much am I willing to pay to assuage that risk?&#8221; I think that&#8217;s what most of those bullet points up there are all about. I thank one of the security consultants I worked with down in LA for pointing out to me that the real role of security within an organization isn&#8217;t securing systems, it&#8217;s managing risk. So Chris, if you end up reading this, thanks for opening my eyes to that so early on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/000504.html">Entry in Seth Finkelstein&#8217;s blog</a> pondering why it is that people keep blogs. He mentions some of the common reasons in there, like exposure to a new audience if you&#8217;re running a business related blog, and the simple need to communicate which is fulfilled by a daily diary. I actually did a whole lot of thinking along these lines before I wrote the first version of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>. I know a lot of reasons showed up once I started blogging that I didn&#8217;t expect at first. Maintaining my blog has actually helped me organize my thoughts and keep something of a schedule. It provides a great regime for me to stick to in processing the news I read and trying to fit the new content into my world view. It encourages some thoughtful introspection where before there was absolutely none.</p>

<p>But even if all the blogs were mostly just mundane drivel, as <a href="http://www.streettech.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=376">Nate seems to think a lot of them might be</a>, I actually don t think they inherently can&#8217;t be useful. I wrote up an <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/blogging_for_nerds.html">article kinda thing</a> laying down some thoughts I had along the line of how lots and lots of meaningless drivel can add up to something useful. Just take a look at projects like <a href="http://www.everything2.com/">Everything2</a> and their effort to node everything. To a degree, blogs can be viewed as the same type of node network, just not under central control. Now, I admit that the value of the node network itself is still very dubious. But it is at least one tick mark in favor of just &#8220;writing about everything&#8221;. This human society of ours is still very much based on social policy and morality. And at the end of the day, social policy and morality boil down the sum of public opinion. So even the most mundane and droll opinion is significant. Especially if it can be counted and analyzed because the author has chosen to share the info.</p>
