Having a closed off IM system makes as much sense as a closed off email system. At least I think that&#8217;s what it says.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Can I just take a quick break to mention how much ass it sucks that I have to do <a href="http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/tfiles/hack/ubuntu.txt">things like this</a> to even consider trying to play DVDs under Linux. I was all psyched to get some movies that I&#8217;ve been waiting on, but I don&#8217;t have the time to deal with shit like that. And the audio and video codecs are all over the place too. Get one DVD working and the others may or may not also play. And don&#8217;t even get me started on region encodings. Funny thing is, if I were to Bittorrent the stuff it would 99% of the time come in a format that I can play with an open source program (even though mplayer is open source, it depends on codecs which are not). Hmm. Pay money to people to get this sliver of coated plastic representing something I already own in magnetic tape format - which may or may not work on my beloved Linux system. Or download something that almost certainly will work. I don&#8217;t even need to flip a coin to figure this one out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting post over at Terra Nova about <a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2005/08/the_pathos_of_n.html">The Pathos of Nintendogs</a>. I&#8217;ve spoken with <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008604.html">Russ about the game before</a>, and the overall appeal still escapes me. However, I really groove to this line: &#8220;From a games AI perspective, would it be easier - and would easier first  steps encourage more sure-footed second steps - to design virtual game worlds which are in some sense more needy than confrontational?&#8221; Nice question, and certainly a great framework in which to ask it. We&#8217;ve seen a couple of steps in this direction in terms of AI overall. A move from the &#8220;digital office assistant&#8221; mindset to a &#8220;clippy&#8221; mindset. From a general assistive piece of software that can predict your activities and present options and solutions, to software that looks over your shoulder and attempts to tune its operation based on your past behavior. Is there a logical extension of the idea of neediness into areas besides games? There have been gimmicky attempts at this sort of thing before, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve ever explicitly focused on the neediness of the AI being a solid component.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a good one from Bruce: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/08/identity_thief.html">Identity Thief Steals House</a>. He links to one of his older essays, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/04/mitigating_iden.html">Mitigating Identity Theft</a>. Definitely worth a read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the solutions being proposed in Congress won&#8217;t help. To see why, we need to start with the basics. The very term &#8220;identity theft&#8221; is an oxymoron. Identity is not a possession that can be acquired or lost; it&#8217;s not a thing at all. Someone&#8217;s identity is the one thing about a person that cannot be stolen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The real crime here is fraud; more specifically, impersonation leading to fraud. Impersonation is an ancient crime, but the rise of information-based credentials gives it a modern spin. A criminal impersonates a victim online and steals money from his account. He impersonates a victim in order to deceive financial institutions into granting credit to the criminal in the victim&#8217;s name. He impersonates a victim to the Post Office and gets the victim&#8217;s address changed. He impersonates a victim in order to fool the police into arresting the wrong man. No one&#8217;s identity is stolen; identity information is being misused to commit fraud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was linked off Slashdot, so I&#8217;m sure everyone and their grandmother has already seen it, but <a href="http://zone-mr.net/?act=entry&amp;id=36">here&#8217;s a story about some folks tracking down a cell phone theif</a>. Besides liking the final bit:</p>

<blockquote><p>Moral of the story - even if you&#8217;re enough of a cunt to steal from a charity raffle, don&#8217;t be fucktarded enough to steal a phone from a community of phone experts.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s cool that they found the theif and all, got their phone back. W00t, and so on. But I don&#8217;t like the idea of people being able to track me due to my actions online. And lots of the current structure of mobile communications enforces a coupling between my identity and my activity online. Not that it has to, it&#8217;s intentially setup that way to &#8220;prevent abuse&#8221;. <sarcasm>Which works just smashingly!</sarcasm> I don&#8217;t know, just kinda stuck me weird. I must be spending too much time trawling hacking boards in my quest for a <a href="http://blog.davidkaspar.com/archives/2005/07/psp_firmware_20_is_out.php">buffer overflow attack against the PSP browser</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html">interesting tidbit from the Google Talk developer info:</a> (hat tip <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050824-5234.html">arstechnica</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>We look forward to federating with any service provider who shares our belief in enabling user choice and open communications. We do believe, however, that it is important to balance openness with ensuring that we maintain a safe and reliable service that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses. We are using the federation opportunity with EarthLink and Sipphone to develop a set of guidelines by which all members of the federated network can work together to ensure that we protect our users while maximizing the reach of the network. We are also eager to hear from other people in the industry about how best to build a federation model that is open, scalable, and ensures best-in-class user experiences.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah, I get it. Someone <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=549#comments">commented on my last post about Google Talk</a> about server to server and federation, Google is working on it. I guess this is what they meant. I just wanted to weigh in and say that I don&#8217;t consider this open, just cause I know everyone is dying to know what I think. Open means open, as in services can interact without someone having to approve them. This describes a closed environment. Closed for all the right reasons, but closed none the less. It&#8217;s definitely possible to do bad things with good intentions. This is one of them. Closing a service to prevent spam now just hurts the platform overall in the long run. Go read <a href="http://www.code-is-law.org/">Code and other Laws of Cyberspace</a> if you haven&#8217;t already by the way, it&#8217;s killer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had a background task running that steals a few cycles whenever I should be sleeping and checks out what it would get to make the laptop I have from work do WPA. I have a Thinkpad R51 I inherited, and while I wait for my laptop to come in I&#8217;ve been playing around with it to see what I could get working. The work wireless network uses WPA-PSK, and that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always been a pain for Linux. So here&#8217;s my quick description of getting the Thinkpad R51 (using the <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">Intel ipw2200</a> driver) working with WPA. I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> as the distro by the way, 5.04 in particular. So maybe these instructions will actually be relevant to someone!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ipw2200 driver that ships with the default kernel in Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t have support for a lot of the operations that the WPA setup requires. I started out with a fresh download of the latest stable kernel (2.6.12.5 as of this writing) just to head off any potential issues with newness of versions. This is pretty bleeding edge stuff (there are Makefiles at least, so it could be worse :-).</p></li>
<li><p>Grab the config from /boot and copy it to .config in your new kernel area, make menuconfig and resave, compile, install, generally get the system working with that new kernel</p></li>
<li><p>Grab the <a href="http://ieee80211.sourceforge.net/">ieee80211 subsystem</a>, I used the latest as of this writing, 1.0.3. The compile and install is very easy here (Yay for installed kernel headers!!).</p></li>
<li><p>Now grab the <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">driver for the network card, ipw2200</a>. I used 1.0.6, which was the latest as of this writing. You&#8217;ll also need the latest firmware, also linked to from the ipw2200 page. The releases of firmware are numbered according to which versions of the driver they go with. The firmware I grabbed started with 1.0.4 and ran through the current version. Compile and install the ipw2200 driver, copy the firmwares into place (I used /lib/hotplug/firmware).</p></li>
<li><p>And finally you&#8217;ll need a copy of <a href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/">wpa_supplicant</a>. This is where things start to get really sketchy. This is bleeding edge for you. You&#8217;ll have to create a configuration file for the package in order to build it.  Here&#8217;s what mine looks like:
`CONFIG_DRIVER_IPW=y</p>

<h1>CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD=y</h1>

<h1>CONFIG_DRIVER_NDIS=y</h1>

CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXTENSION=y
CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y
CONFIG_EAP_MD5=y
CONFIG_EAP_MSCHAPV2=y
CONFIG_EAP_TLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_PEAP=y
CONFIG_EAP_TTLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_GTC=y
CONFIG_EAP_OTP=y

<h1>CONFIG_EAP_SIM=y</h1>

<h1>CONFIG_EAP_AKA=y</h1>

CONFIG_EAP_PSK=y
CONFIG_EAP_PAX=y
CONFIG_EAP_LEAP=y

<h1>CONFIG_PCSC=y</h1>

<p>`I coppied wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli to /usr/local/bin, although I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s superfluous.</p></li>
<li><p>Then take the wpa_supplicant.conf sample file and tailor it to your needs. I just followed the example from in there that most closely matched my setup.</p></li>
<li><p>Run wpa_supplicant giving it the interface to use and the configuration file: &#8220;wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -d&#8221; The -d option keeps it in the foreground so you can see all the debugging output. If it works you should see messages saying that it&#8217;s associated with a basestation and extablished a key.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Tada! Now you can run scripts against the interface to do things like DHCP and everything should be all peachy. Sweet! Now I don&#8217;t have to use a Windows machine just so I can tool around the office downloading stuff and looking like I&#8217;m important.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, not that I have the time to play with something new, but I had to get this out of my system cause I haven&#8217;t seen other comments yet (Well, except <a href="http://www.decaffeinated.org/archives/2005/08/25/googletalk">this one</a>). One of the reasons I got really jazzed about <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a> running XMPP underneath is because XMPP is a more distributed protocol than the IM systems. What I mean by that is that there&#8217;s supposed to be server to server communication. Even though I run my own Jabber server at bitsplitter.net I can still talk to folks at jabber.org because the servers figure out how to talk. Kinda like the way email gets from one place to another. When the jabber.org server sees thatguymike@bitsplitter.net, jabber.org knows to open a connection to bitsplitter.net and start delivering messages. So not only can you create plugins to Jabber by creating things that emulate clients, you can toss a whole server into the mix. And all the other servers can communicate with it by default cause the domain based naming scheme for Jabber accounts takes care of telling the server how to find each other. Sweet.  Except this doesn&#8217;t seem to be true for talk.google.com. My username is &#8220;miker@gmail.com&#8221; but the service to connect to is at talk.google.com. Hmm.  Maybe miker@gmail.com@talk.google.com works? Doesn&#8217;t seem like it. Maybe from the Google Talk side I can add my bitsplitter.net account? No go, looks like the Google Talk folks have server to server communication off. That sucks. Turn it on!</p>

<p>Also, here&#8217;s an idea I would like to try, but I don&#8217;t have time for. Maybe if you do you can. I can&#8217;t get any of the normal dedicated Jabber clients to talk to Google Talk (<a href="http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Gossip">Gossip</a> or <a href="http://gabber.sourceforge.net/">Gabber</a> for example). Why would it matter? Because Jabber also supports something called services. These are server side goodies to keep all sorts of neat info or provide extension functions. Examples: directories of users on the system, info about the group chat rooms, or gateways into other protocols or sources of information. What&#8217;s installed on that Google Talk server?  What services are there? Without allowing server to server communication the extensibility of the platform is really in question. Dumb. But maybe there are some other goodies in there for now.</p>
