  <div class="entry-content"><p>I need to echo some of the stuff that <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008608.html">Russ says about New Orleans</a> and <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/09/02.html#a1294">Jon Udell as well about the wireless infrastructure</a>. Some stuff, not all of it. I actually don&#8217;t much care about New Orleans. I was there before it flooded and got to see it. Great place, too bad it&#8217;s underwater. I&#8217;m not saying that people shouldn&#8217;t live there, but if you live there you&#8217;re taking certain risks. And when those risks becomes reality it&#8217;s your problem. HOWEVER, I do feel that my taxes have paid for a certain degree of &#8220;disaster preparredness&#8221;. The folks on the teevee keep telling me that. Our nation is apparently prepared for anything. Which is why I&#8217;m kinda concerned that it was caught offgaurd by a storm system. They&#8217;re usually not easy to miss. They don&#8217;t even sneak really. They just kinda roll up and do their thing. So what is it exactly that we didn&#8217;t expect? And why is it that we can&#8217;t deal with it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not gonna donate, I&#8217;ve already given enough. And about this &#8220;Think about yourself being in this same situation and donate&#8221;. No way, total lunacy. People are dying in the streets, attempts to prepare and dumping in huge amounts of money did shit, current tactics being proposed are point solutions lending no real stability and probably decreasing our capability long term. And I&#8217;m supposed to donate? How about I just set the money on fire instead and hope the ashes soak up enough water to help them out? So here&#8217;s my advice: Think about yourself being in the same situation and buy a shotgun. Learn how to use it. And &#8220;be prepared&#8221; to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s some stuff I&#8217;ve been either working with or reading up on lately, cool stuff that I&#8217;ve heard about in passing but isn&#8217;t in general usage yet:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://wiki.hping.org/">hping</a> - network packet generator, more like a network script adaptor. It provides low level packet generation functions to a TCL interpreter. Hping always gets mentioned at DefCon, and I say &#8220;Wow, I should check that out&#8221;, and then promptly forget. I was just wishing it had a python interface instead&#8230;.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">scapy</a> - which is a Python interface to the same low level kinds of packet manipulation. Yum. Time to install Linux on an Ipaq with 802.11 support and go cause some mayhem.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/softflowd/">softflowd</a> - captures network traffic and provides aggregate statistics. MTRG is cool, but the second question is always &#8220;so what&#8217;s causing that spike&#8221;, and I&#8217;m hoping this can help out with that. Check out this <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2005/08/18/Big_Scary_Daemons.html?page=1">ONLamp article about netflows</a>. Another one I&#8217;ve heard about but never tried.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s kinda a slow news day overall. Maybe everyone is all wrapped up in this whole city underwater thing. Not my style. So instead I&#8217;m catching up a bit on the geekier side of the reading I have sitting untouched in my aggie. Posts from LTU are always good for some geekin, and <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/941">the post about Context Oriented Programming</a> in particular caught my attention. I started reading the paper, and right about the end of the first page had a pretty decent mental image of what was up so I stopped. Nice idea. And then there&#8217;s the comment in LTU saying that it sounds like AOP (that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/01/14/aop.html">Aspect Oriented Programming</a> for those of you who don&#8217;t have the kind of m4d cred that me and my dawg <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/user/view/1">Ehud Lamm</a> do). Sure does. Not hard to figure out, AOP is listed as related work at the end of the paper. Also not that it means anything of course. You can write object oriented programs in imperitive languages and declarative programs in functional languages and do all sorts of nutty stuff in C. It all comes down to what stuff the tools make it easy to do. Is the context oriented model new? No, probably not. Sounds exactly like the kind of abstraction that exists in protocol design. However bringing the model up to the level of the implementation of classes, and making the basic level of granularity for the programmer activation and deactivation of layers of functionality is somewhat interesting. Reminds me of the move to get busses abstracted in the Linux kernel. There was a proliferation of devices at one point, and suddenly a device that used to exist as PCI now all of a sudden had a PCMCIA version and a USB version. So the busses were made &#8220;objects&#8221; in their own right so that the actual device code could be factored out from the bus manipulation code. If you take the view from the kernel end the bus is delegating to individual device objects, but if you take a look at the system overall it&#8217;s very close to context oriented composition of the device model.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Can I just take a quick break to mention how much ass it sucks that I have to do <a href="http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/tfiles/hack/ubuntu.txt">things like this</a> to even consider trying to play DVDs under Linux. I was all psyched to get some movies that I&#8217;ve been waiting on, but I don&#8217;t have the time to deal with shit like that. And the audio and video codecs are all over the place too. Get one DVD working and the others may or may not also play. And don&#8217;t even get me started on region encodings. Funny thing is, if I were to Bittorrent the stuff it would 99% of the time come in a format that I can play with an open source program (even though mplayer is open source, it depends on codecs which are not). Hmm. Pay money to people to get this sliver of coated plastic representing something I already own in magnetic tape format - which may or may not work on my beloved Linux system. Or download something that almost certainly will work. I don&#8217;t even need to flip a coin to figure this one out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting post over at Terra Nova about <a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2005/08/the_pathos_of_n.html">The Pathos of Nintendogs</a>. I&#8217;ve spoken with <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008604.html">Russ about the game before</a>, and the overall appeal still escapes me. However, I really groove to this line: &#8220;From a games AI perspective, would it be easier - and would easier first  steps encourage more sure-footed second steps - to design virtual game worlds which are in some sense more needy than confrontational?&#8221; Nice question, and certainly a great framework in which to ask it. We&#8217;ve seen a couple of steps in this direction in terms of AI overall. A move from the &#8220;digital office assistant&#8221; mindset to a &#8220;clippy&#8221; mindset. From a general assistive piece of software that can predict your activities and present options and solutions, to software that looks over your shoulder and attempts to tune its operation based on your past behavior. Is there a logical extension of the idea of neediness into areas besides games? There have been gimmicky attempts at this sort of thing before, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve ever explicitly focused on the neediness of the AI being a solid component.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a good one from Bruce: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/08/identity_thief.html">Identity Thief Steals House</a>. He links to one of his older essays, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/04/mitigating_iden.html">Mitigating Identity Theft</a>. Definitely worth a read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the solutions being proposed in Congress won&#8217;t help. To see why, we need to start with the basics. The very term &#8220;identity theft&#8221; is an oxymoron. Identity is not a possession that can be acquired or lost; it&#8217;s not a thing at all. Someone&#8217;s identity is the one thing about a person that cannot be stolen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The real crime here is fraud; more specifically, impersonation leading to fraud. Impersonation is an ancient crime, but the rise of information-based credentials gives it a modern spin. A criminal impersonates a victim online and steals money from his account. He impersonates a victim in order to deceive financial institutions into granting credit to the criminal in the victim&#8217;s name. He impersonates a victim to the Post Office and gets the victim&#8217;s address changed. He impersonates a victim in order to fool the police into arresting the wrong man. No one&#8217;s identity is stolen; identity information is being misused to commit fraud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was linked off Slashdot, so I&#8217;m sure everyone and their grandmother has already seen it, but <a href="http://zone-mr.net/?act=entry&amp;id=36">here&#8217;s a story about some folks tracking down a cell phone theif</a>. Besides liking the final bit:</p>

<blockquote><p>Moral of the story - even if you&#8217;re enough of a cunt to steal from a charity raffle, don&#8217;t be fucktarded enough to steal a phone from a community of phone experts.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s cool that they found the theif and all, got their phone back. W00t, and so on. But I don&#8217;t like the idea of people being able to track me due to my actions online. And lots of the current structure of mobile communications enforces a coupling between my identity and my activity online. Not that it has to, it&#8217;s intentially setup that way to &#8220;prevent abuse&#8221;. <sarcasm>Which works just smashingly!</sarcasm> I don&#8217;t know, just kinda stuck me weird.
