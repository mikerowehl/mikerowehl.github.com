  <div class="entry-content"><p>My power went out at home. Just a localized event, but annoying cause it happens to be localized to my area. But given the new set of toys I&#8217;m playing with I don&#8217;t have to be disconnected. I had a conversation on the <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope">Open Palm Environment WINKsite</a> chat area using my phone, downloaded my email to my Palm, and now I&#8217;m about to post this using <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>. That&#8217;s pretty well connected without any power. Just another advantage of mobile computing to keep in mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.infrastructures.org/">Infrastructures.org</a> is a great resource for anyone that needs to administer multiple Unix style machines and is looking to do so more efficiently. The principles laid down there are fantastic, and they stick to open source tools in their descriptions of how to put systems together, and even have a release of their own code called <a href="http://www.infrastructures.org/bootstrap/isconf.shtml">ISconf</a>. It is hard to try to work like an infrastructure architect rather than a system administrator. But when you do the long term benefits are astounding. I&#8217;ve been places where everything was so ad-hoc that trying to setup an infrastructure around their software was futile, but even then the setup paid off in terms of keeping the base systems up to date. Any admin should at least read over the stuff. Even if you think most of it is complete bunk, there will probably be a few points you can use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-util.html?ca=dgr-lnxw06ArtWriting">an article at IBM DeveloperWorks</a> about writing reusable command line utilities. The article focuses on five guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do one thing well.</p></li>
<li><p>Be a filter.</p></li>
<li><p>Generalize.</p></li>
<li><p>Be robust.</p></li>
<li><p>Be new.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The article goes into some detail about each of those areas. The resources section lists <em>The UNIX Programming Environment</em>, and I would strongly recommend <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/index.html"><em>The Practice of Programming</em></a>. For any level of progammer, beginner through expert, I think TPOP has something to offer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://lists.pilot-link.org/pipermail/pilot-link-devel/2004-January/000624.html">message on the pilot-link-devel mailing list</a> about replacing the normal Palm Network Sync with something else. Recently Palm has been a huge pain in the ass. Just about every device comes out with some new extension to the sync protocol. Something that breaks the existing tools under Linux and other operating systems. And Palm isn&#8217;t releasing info about these changes as far as anyone can tell. So, like I also <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=102">posted about the other day</a>, the pilot-link developers are thinking about ignoring Palm&#8217;s interface for sync and writing something of their own. Something based on open protocols and standard interfaces. Something that Palm can&#8217;t change underneath us quite so often. I think there are probably a lot of people thinking in this direction. Hopefully we&#8217;ll get the critical mass required to get the project rolling. I&#8217;ve already started working on palm-xmlrpc. Something I consider a precursor to my work in the area. Hopefully this means there will be others hacking in this direction.</p>

<time datetime="2004-01-16T02:01:40-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 16<span>th</span>, 2004</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have heard people talk about the danger of letting commercial software turn into the defacto standard for how to do things. I didn&#8217;t really think this was a big deal, until I tried to create a boot disk to do a BIOS update the other day. This is where the defacto standard comes in. For those who do low level system admin work on x86 based computers, DOS is the defacto standard. When a computer manufacturer wants to write an application that does something special to their hardware, they write a little DOS app. DOS is really primitive and simple and doesn&#8217;t try to stand in the way of the programs that it runs, so it&#8217;s ideal for writing specialized applications to test hardware or update firmware. I had to update the BIOS of an Intel motherboard, and the instructions said to create a boot disk and copy their utilities over to it. No problem, I don&#8217;t have a Windows system, but my girlfriend&#8217;s system should work fine. It pains me to touch the thing, but I can stand it for stints of 10 minutes or less.</p>

<p>Yet to my surprize, none of the commands I remembered working for creating a boot disk under Windows seemed to work on the Windows 2000 system she has. Weird. Ditto for the Windows XP laptop from work. Double weird. So I poked around some, and found <a href="http://www.bootdisk.com">Bootdisk.com</a>, but I just couldn&#8217;t believe that was the way to create a bootable floppy. So finally I caved in and asked some friends, people who work with Windows quite a bit. And they told me that Bootdisk.com is the best way to go, Windows doesn&#8217;t have the tools to create bootable floppy disks any more. WOW! First of all, I see no reason to have dropped these commands from Windows at all. Sure, the newer operating systems aren&#8217;t DOS based, but so what? You can still include the commands and images needed in order to create a boot disk. This is another reason to charge for MCSE exams and provides a nice barrier for an operation that should be shit simple, so I guess that&#8217;s just not Microsofts bag. And I thought they were about making life simple for users, that what people keep telling me. The second wow is that someone from the community stepped up and created the site needed to initialize these disks. I&#8217;m sure Microsoft is aware of the issue, they don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a problem for anyone who makes x86 hardware like motherboards (Intel, Tyan, ASUS, etc), but they still distribute their guides ignoring the issue. I was someone from the community who stepped up to fill the gap.</p>

<p>Now this isn&#8217;t really a huge problem. There are even efforts like <a href="http://www.freedos.org/freedos/about/">FreeDOS</a> who provide even better alternatives. But the community is solving these problems. I never used to think twice about creating a bootable floppy under Windows, but now that functionality is gone. None of the companies that should care about this seem to be working on fixing it. People ask why I have such an issue going over to a Windows system to do something. Well, this is it. Cause when I use Windows to do something I&#8217;m placing myself in a position where someone else has chosen how I have to operate. And they&#8217;re forcing me to base my work on a platform I don&#8217;t and will not own, and which I feel has a dubious future. At least I&#8217;m happy that Microsoft and hardware manufacturers have provided such an excellent example of user disservice that I can point to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The speech by Paul Saffo this evening was very interesting. There were many points he brought up that jive with the stuff that I&#8217;ve been working on. There was a lot of stuff he said that meshed well with the events I&#8217;ve seen and heard about. Here are some of the points that I found most interesting.</p>

<p>One of his initial points was that while most successful technologies follow the S curve of adoption, engineers still think in terms of straight lines. The S curve means that a technology spends a long time growing very slowly, has a period of rapid growth, and finally tapers off. Paul said that engineers know this, but for some reason still expect a constant slope for adoption. This leads to overexpectation of demand initially, and underestimation once the technology makes it past the inflection point. I have seen this happen with the technologies I&#8221;ve worked with. There are areas that I almost gave up on because they didn&#8217;t appear to be catching on, only to see them explode with sudden activity and broad uptake. I think it was quite insightful to call out that this over enthusiastic approach leads to late comers being able to dominate the area. If the early company doesn&#8217;t adjust their outlook they end up underestimating the market and leaving room for someone else to move in.</p>

<p>He also cautioned about telecom companies going after wireless networking by fighting the technology with regulation. He said that 802.11 and VOIP is a real threat to telecom companies, and that once those telcos start failing they&#8217; fight wireless networking using regulations (telco requirements for emergency services, FCC regulations, international regulations, whatever). As a point in this argument he said that 3g and 4g wireless are really hurting. It&#8217;s quite likely that these networks will fail, and that the technology in general will be abandoned if it does.</p>

<p>The final point that I want to call out is that he said that us software people just haven&#8217;t gotten the interactions with software correct yet. We&#8217;ve never been good at interfaces and we probably never will be. But users can figure out what the interface should look like. If they get their hands on the technology they will determine how it should best be used. I think what he was driving at here is that tech is not dead, it just needs some time to get swinging into the next generation. At some point someone will pick up the right mix of rubble from past failures and give birth to the Next Big Thing. I like that point quite a bit, cause I like to think I&#8217;m one of the next generation of Silicon Valley. And it gives me a degree of hope in my constant quest for the way that things should work. Eventually something will kick off. And even if it isn&#8217;t one of my ideas, hopefully it&#8217;ll be something I can be involved with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I created a new category for <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,61889,00.html?tw=wn_story_top5">this article about a direct neural interface</a>. The category is called Dweeb, and it&#8217;s for those things that aren&#8217;t quite mobile computing, or open source, or related to things that I&#8217;m working on, but are still just too fucking cool to ignore. I have no idea what would go into trying to build an interface like this, how well I think it would work, how marketable I think it would be&#8230; no, I just get starry eyed and whisper &#8220;oooo, I want one of those&#8221;. That&#8217;s what Dweeb is gonna be all about.</p>

<p>Note that I didn&#8217;t start off the Dweeb category with a post about a Segway. That&#8217;s called being a &#8220;Fan Boy&#8221;. There is a big difference, and it lies in the desire to mislead the public. BrainGate is an amazingly advanced technology being used to help a very small market of special needs people, but Dweebs like me have picked up interest in it, and we&#8217;ll probably have to wait a long time to get our hands on it. Segway is a marketing experiment in pushing an amazingly advanced technology out to people who don&#8217;t need it, and people who Should Know Better fell for it, and although it&#8217;s available now no one is quite sure why it should be. People on Segways shouldn&#8217;t be surprized if they get <a href="http://www.fuh2.com/">the Hummer salute</a> or pelted with rotten vegetables. Not that the Segway doesn&#8217;t have some great technical advances, it just had a disproportionate amount of hype and propaganda to go along with it. Lots of great technical advances don&#8217;t immediately lead to mass market penetration. Normally you have to ride the adoption curve, like everyone else. Sometimes you might get lucky and your product might exhibit fad trending and get snapped up by the millions, but that happens very infrequently. Everyone is expecting a business person to promote their idea, but if you try to cheat the adoption curve by lying you should expect to get smacked around some.</p>

<p>Sorry to spend so long harping on this, but I feel that this aspect of consumer pushback is missing in a lot of tech markets. We end up with overpriced products that perform poorly and get forced through quick revision cycles. I don&#8217;t want Dweeb to be another Fan Boy area for cheering every worthless product. That&#8217;s how economies end up with big bubbles, and it sucks when bubbles get all bursty. So it&#8217;s important that we not let our markets get all.. bursty bubbly. That&#8217;s why normally I blog about things I actually do, or have tried to do, or at least am involved with enough to know the background. Dweeb is not that. I have never built a neural interface, I just really wish I could. So Dweeb is all that stuff for which I can claim no street cred. Maybe that would have been a better name for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell posts about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005647.html">Mobile Web Page Thoughts</a>, in particular bringing up the need to both create and consume from mobile devices. I think there are some great points in there, such as devices coming with bound server space. Personally, I woudn&#8217;t like my mobile devices to work this way, but that&#8217;s cause I&#8217;m a hacker. I would rather have everything work the way I want than have it work automatically. But I can certainly see the value of the device having default associated space for content. Services like this are very much what I would like to make as part of the <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">Open Palm Environment</a>. Like I mentioned a long time ago on a <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/openSource/palmos.html">completely different website</a>, the existing network sync for the Palm is pathetic. I would love to see a real network sync tool, something using open standards and a decent protocol framework. This is something that the <a href="http://www.pilot-link.org">pilot-link</a> and <a href="http://www.plkr.org">Plucker</a> developers seem to groove on quite a bit as well. Then either users could setup the server on their own space, or someone could make a business out of hosting it as a service. Either way, I really don&#8217;t care. This then becomes the framework for uploading web content from your Palm device. Maybe the content is meant to be accessed by you only, such as your address book or calendar by default. Or you could chose to present a front end so people could browse your content online, or even allow others to directly sync your calender to their palm as well. And there&#8217;s no reason to restrict this to palm apps either. If the servers were defined using web services this framework could provide sync between all your applications. Your laptop and home PC and work PC could all use a contacts app that syncs through the same service that your PDA uses. New applications could exchange backup data with flags telling what data the user wants public and what data should remain private. This is how I think Palm devices should start talking to the world, directly over the network to servers which can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>provide backup services</p></li>
<li><p>provide syncronization between multiple applications on multiple platforms</p></li>
<li><p>allow palm users to directly collaborate</p></li>
<li><p>publish information to the web at large, presenting standard HTML pages for viewing and editing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Makes sense to me at least.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not much into the ringtone market at all, but I got an email from TJ at <a href="http://tonethis.com">ToneThis</a> talking about the way that they&#8217;re approaching setting up a mobile service. The way ToneThis works a user can encode music from the MP3 library on their home PC and turn it into a ringtone. I know it doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal, but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s really the way that the system should work. What should be surprizing is that it&#8217;s hard to get a ringtone on a phone unless your service provider sells it to you. But for some reason this is mostly just unquestingly taken as &#8220;the way things work&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure that one of the reasons that it&#8217;s hard to get a quality ringtone onto your phone is because service providers want to charge for them. ToneThis is a way to break away from  service providers wanting to wring every cent out of their customers. Instead of having to choose from a library of ringtones you get exactly the music you want. This is from the <a href="http://www.tonethis.com/index.php?page=news">news section of the ToneThis site</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Pannu says &#8220;Sprint&#8217;s open architecture allows users to access services like ToneThis, even when no formal deal is in place. I expect other carriers beyond Sprint will open up their networks, much the way Internet service providers have become conduits for outside traffic. What has been a series of closed networks is becoming more and more open&#8230; &#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I certainly hope so. This is an excellent example of the kind of thing I hope will be possible if providers do open up their networks. The carriers might loose the additional revenue from the ringtone. But because users have more control, and the flexibility to use the network in the way they see fit (rather than the way their service provider wants them to) I think they&#8217;ll see a lot more raw thoughput. And more importantly perhaps, I think they&#8217;ll see a lot more users in general. Right now cellular providers in the US seem to be trying to reign in innovation so that they can make sure they&#8217;re optimally positioned in the value chain for any new service.</p>

<p>I really do hope that providers are starting to trend in the direction of more open networks, and that we&#8217;ll see more services like ToneThis. Most services view the user a passive consumer hopefully willing to swallow what the service providers dish out. I would be very happy to see more services which allow the user to genuinely interact with the network - producing, consuming, exchanging, gathering, and generally doing whatever they want. The current services remind me way too much of the television network, pumping out large volumes of poor content. I&#8217;m frequently reminded of the description of biomass in <a href="http://slashdot.org/books/99/10/18/1049244.shtml">Snow Crash</a>, where the media moguls are described like whales straining the sea for plankton, only the media moguls are straining viewers for money. I find this analogy unnervingly apt when I look at the way that service providers seem to envision their users.</p>
