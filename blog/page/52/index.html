  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joi Ito had a post yesterday that mentioned he thinks of himself as a &#8220;Social Entrepreneur&#8221;, and pointed to <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/csi/SEDefinition.html">this definition at Stanford Business School</a>. I found the commentary to be a pretty interesting overview of entrepreneurship in general. I&#8217;ve just discovered that I&#8217;m a huge Schumpeter fan, and now I see the name all over the place. I actually thought this concept of &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; that Schumpeter describes wasn&#8217;t very well known, or maybe not well accepted. I hadn&#8217;t heard it till just a few months ago. But now that I&#8217;ve read about it, and I&#8217;m looking for it, it appears all over. I have to get some of his other writings, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll enjoy those as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MyPalmLife reports today on a GPS solution from <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=229&amp;c=1">TomTom</a>, and last week there was news about an option from <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=225&amp;c=1">Navman</a>. Both of them seem to offer Bluetooth based GPS devices, which I would love to get my hands on to try out. Of course, I would be more interested in hooking the information into something like lookups against <a href="http://www.geourl.com/">GeoURL</a>. Both of those navigation options seem to be at least partially focused on being able to provide navigation to &#8220;points of interest&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure most of those won&#8217;t match up well with what I consider interesting. Of course, I won&#8217;t know if that assumption is true unless I fool around with them for a while. But the Navman at least seems to focus on static maps pulled off an SD card. Hopefully some of the people who pick up these things end up hacking at them a bit. Sounds like the Palm is really gaining potential as a platform for geolocation services.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on mobile computing stuff for a while, but I don&#8217;t normally follow developing standards that closely. Normally my work starts after other people have done the standardizing, and I have the onerous job of getting a dozen different &#8220;amazing new technologies&#8221; to all work together to do something that a normal human would want them to do. You know, like looking up a location on a map or showing you a picture of your kids getting home from school. Little details like that, normally necessary when turning technology into product (a step some people tend to forget). But quite a few people have called my attention to <a href="http://www.w3c.org/Mobile/CCPP/">this new standard from the W3C</a>. Enough people that I think I&#8217;m actually going to have to give this one an advanced reading. Supposedly it&#8217;s already being used by quite a few devices. It provides an RDF based description of device capabilities, so that a web server can tailor content to the device being used. I&#8217;ve heard that promise from a number of protocols before&#8230; but I&#8217;m trying to keep an open mind so that I can give this one a fair chance. The spec was just recently passed, just a few days ago actually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was an event close to where I lived about RSS, but I had to miss it. Looks like there&#8217;s a chance to make it up however, a webcast about RSS called <a href="http://myst-technology.com/mysmartchannels/public/item/17539">RSS Winterfest</a>. I signed up and I&#8217;ll probably drop in on some of the sessions. I wish they had a little more info about how they&#8217;re posting the summaries. I probably would have skipped the signup and just read about it, but I think participation is important if someone has put the time into setting up an event like this. So I&#8217;m going to put my realtime time into it and listen as it happens. They have some great speakers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell Beattie has started <a href="http://www.mobknowledge.com">a new website</a> to serve as a &#8220;knowledge base for mobile phones&#8221;. He <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005787.html">posted about it in his blog</a>, describing why he chose the collaboration format that he did and what the goals are. I immediately signed up and added info for a bunch of the US providers I&#8217;ve tested equiptment with. I think this site is a great idea, and I even agree with the knowledge base format. One thing I would like to see is access to the KB from mobile phones. If it were possible to get to the knowledge base from a mobile phone, the KB could have info about services like SMS shortcodes, WAP services, links to other sites with more info. I think that keeping the site a knowledge base instead of a news site is a great idea, but I also think that these other features really are part of mobile computing.</p>

<p>The phone features and usage tips are definitely necessary. And that&#8217;s very usefull, if you&#8217;re looking to contact another user or connect to a known resource. But I think that the chances are high that if you end up at the knowledge base you won&#8217;t know about services that are available. Maybe this is just because I have a chip on my shoulder with respect to wrenching control of mobile services away from service providers, but this strikes me as an avenue where we can make some progress. One of the reasons that Russell says the site is necessary is because providers don&#8217;t have the support staff required to deal with advanced services. It&#8217;s nice to be able to address this need for this class of users, but it also means that we&#8217;re doing the work for the service providers, but they&#8217;re collecting the money. While we&#8217;re at it, I would like to make a statement. The statement should be something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey service providers, we as a community can support expert users better than you can. We can get experts the info they need to access services which make you money. Why don&#8217;t you stop trying to reach into our pockets by attempting to control mobile services, and stick to just providing bandwidth. In return we&#8217;ll support this growing class of high ARPU users which make that business model profitable.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s my pie in the sky ideal. Maybe it&#8217;s out of line with everyone else, but I&#8217;m sticking to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Register is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/64/34943.html">reporting that Nokia is planning a Perl port for series 60 phones</a>. This would be really cool. Not only cause I think more development options are a good idea, but because the language is an open source option. I admit I&#8217;m not familiar with most of what Nokia has been doing, but I did recently inherit a <a href="http://www.obsoletecomputermuseum.org/diamondmako/">Mako</a>. That prompted me to look around at some of the software, cause the Mako/Psion run what is apparently an early version of Symbian. I was surprized to see how open the Symbian platform seems to be. When I finally get a chance to get a new phone, I&#8217;ll have to take a serious look at Symbian instead of a PalmOS based device. Especially if their developer community is strong and supported with open development tools. Palm has really been slacking in respect to their support for open source developers. And it&#8217;s resulted in lots of bitter and disappointed people. Bad luck for Palm if those people migrate to another platform, somewhere that they&#8217;re supported and able to produce enhancements that they feel good about giving away. That&#8217;s the kind of thing that turns a normal product into a segment dominator, lest Palm forget. That old claim about Palm having &#8220;thousands of add on applications, many of them available for free&#8221; is starting to dwindle. The free apps are showing their age, and are dwarfed by commercial offerings. It leaves everyone except Palm and their commercial developers very frusterated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been setting up software RAID for the guys at <a href="http://www.zamples.com">Zamples</a>, and I found the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Boot+Root+Raid+LILO-3.html">Boot Root RAID Lilo HOWTO</a> to be quite informative. I had never seen that doc before, and it addressed exactly what I was trying to do. I wasn&#8217;t able to get the second drive booting directly, probably cause it&#8217;s a 200gig and the geometry reported is all screwy. But at least it appears that it should work if this were a normal configuration. What I&#8217;ve ended up doing is creating a boot floppy to load the system should the primary drive fail. It&#8217;s not pretty, but until I can dig into LILO and figure out what&#8217;s up (Yea! I&#8217;ll have time for that, sure ;-) this is a good enough solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.osviews.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=732">third part</a> to the series of articles about building a distro that computer retailers could use to build PCs. I still don&#8217;t agree with running the project as a contest, as <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=94">I&#8217;ve mentioned before</a>, but I do think the idea in general is great. The project aims to develop not just a full distro in terms of the software that gets installed on the PC when initially setup, but also marketing materials, artwork, and apparently also software repository services. The article seems to indicate that under the concept of the Open Core of the home desktop distribution providers would now provide value added services. Currently distribution providers make self contained reasonably usable Linux systems. But the author says that the usable Linux system should be the baseline, and that disto providers should be adding something to this base. I can certainly agree with that point, but I think the arguments laid out are a bit fuzzy. I still have trouble picturing how this would unify the distribution providers. Sure, it would move the bar up, which is a good thing. It&#8217;s a step in the correct direction. But it&#8217;s not the complete solution I don&#8217;t think.</p>

<p>The article would almost seem to argue in favor of distributions providing services like Redhat Network, a service which Redhat has abandoned for all lines except the Enterprise editions. This was because the model just was not profitable for the other areas. Maybe there&#8217;s something in there that I missed, maybe coupling the update server with other services would make a difference. Most of the areas in which selling support for open source software seems to be profitable are the dual licensing model. Places where the product is free for non-commercial use, but must be paid for when used in a commercial offering. One example of this would be <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/licensing.html">MySQL</a>, who seem to be very successful with what they&#8217;re doing. Do I think pure support would be profitable for a company? No, I don&#8217;t think it would be. I just haven&#8217;t seen it work well before. Even companies like the former VA Research, who seemed to be aimed in this very direction, were able to make it work. And they seemed to have some very well informed backers and strong supporters. That&#8217;s not to say I don&#8217;t think a pure support play COULD never succeed, I just think the odds are stacked against it.</p>

<p>So what do these providers do? The article says:</p>

<blockquote><p>To a small home-town white box builder or enthusiast who doesn&#8217;t have the resources to provide 24-hour customer support, remote automatic security, application updates, or comprehensive full-service warehousing of third-party commercial software application the resource would prove invaluable. Similarly, this core system might also offer content services such as LinTunes, LycPicks or XanPhony music download services. This is really only the beginning. The sky is the limit.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a nice thought, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s one supported by data from previous attempts. If I were a distro provider I would certainly be looking for a stronger argument for shifting my business. But lets assume that the core proposed here does develop, what can the distro providers do? I just don&#8217;t have a good answer for them. It&#8217;s probably something we should be thinking about if we do want to push Linux distribution in this direction. And I do think this is the direction we want. Hard questions are usually an indication that a solution is heading in the correct direction - they&#8217;re an indication that you&#8217;re treading new ground and not just shuffling around previous issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to <a href="http://www.itworld.ca/Mobile/ViewArticle.aspx?id=idgml-8f1ddb0a-dced-4aaa-a13e-745fa0f2c1c2&amp;Format=Print">this article at itWorldCanada.com</a> the lawsuit brought against IBM by SCO will not involve copyright infringement. The lawsuit will supposedly center around breech of contract, with SCO arguing that IBM introduced intellectual property belonging to SCO into the Linux kernel. I don&#8217;t know if this is really a change in position by SCO, or if this just indicates the direction against IBM only. I think they&#8217;re threatening lots of people with lawsuits, so this position used against IBM might have nothing to do with those others. I would like to hear what property exactly belongs to SCO regarding the async IO, journaling filesystem, and volume management. At the points where some of the initial work were going on for those features, I was following the Linux development lists pretty closely. And I don&#8217;t remember anyone saying that they were taking code from SCO. It seemed like lots of people hashing out ideas, writing up potential patches, and eventually coming to consensus. Perhaps SCO owns the rights to group development? Unlikely, but I wouldn&#8217;t be too surprized if they thought they did.</p>
