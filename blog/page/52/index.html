  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/01/23.html#a895">post by John Udell</a> about database lockin. I think the issue with SQL dialect lockin is probably more troublesome. I agree that transport independence is a problem though. Databases have been like this for a long time - a standard language to query them, but different libraries for the different databases to actually access them. There&#8217;s probably some issue in there that I&#8217;m not aware of that keeps it from happening, but why isn&#8217;t there a standard transport? ODBC is cool, but it&#8217;s a shim on the application end to allow different drivers to be swapped in as needed. At least in all the uses I have seen. Is there an &#8220;ODBC native&#8221; format that can be used by an RDBMS? I&#8217;m thinking probably not. And if so, why is no one using it? For the proprietary systems like Oracle and DB2 I could certainly see why, they don&#8217;t want people to be able to switch easily. But for open source databases why isn&#8217;t there transport level standardization? Any database gurus out there who might know the answer, please chime in. I vaguely remember something about an XML based query exchange from a number of years ago. That ever make it anywhere?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.beecon.de/howto/pose_bt/index.html">This site</a> describes how to use a physical bluetooth device from a POSE session running under Linux. That&#8217;s just really cool. I with the people actually at Palm would realize the market they lost in open source advocates, but if that isn&#8217;t going to happen at least a couple of talented people can provide an alternative. Of course, this only works for emulating older devices, Palm doesn&#8217;t have anything available for Linux to simulate their newest devices. Thank you <a href="http://www.beecon.de/index.html">BeeCon</a>, this is a great tool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There  are <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Damonv/Public/Doombolt/">images online</a> from a couple of people who constructed a high speed photo lab using a BASIC stamp and some off the shelf parts. I have no idea how expensive high speed photography normally is, or just how hard it is to construct one of these, but the pictures are pretty. I think it&#8217;s also cool they did it for $40, although I&#8217;m assuming that doesn&#8217;t include air compressor, controller, and the various cameras they used. I figured the flash would be the hard part given their description, but it says they just used the flash from a disposable. Mmmmm, impaled fruit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>RSS WinterFest is an RSS webcast that went on over the last two days. Along with the webcast went a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest/index.cgi">wiki</a> a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest/index.cgi?action=weblog_display&amp;category=RSS%20Winterfest%20Weblog">weblog</a> and tons of other resources linked in through both of those. There are some great points brought up, and some points that I really don&#8217;t agree with but might have to put some thought into. I also found <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">Roland&#8217;s blog</a> quite useful, as he seems to be interested in a lot of the same areas as I am. I had trouble connecting to the actual cast the first day, and didn&#8217;t have the time to listen in live for most of today. I wish I could have, the information linked in and generated by the event seems to be of very high quality. This is a group that&#8217;s really taking the time to work through the issues beyond the technical details of getting down a file format. I liked the points under Syndication in the Enterprise from Bill French in particular. Once I work myself out from under the pile of crud I have to do now I need to finish up the Palm XMLPRC work and get onto some of this stuff as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/">Weblogger Meetup</a> in San Francisco last night, but only one other person showed up. I think that it just isn&#8217;t going to happen at all. During December lots of people showed cause the crew from <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> were there. But besides the people that <a href="http://shellen.com/">Jason Shellen</a> invited, and the people that I invited, there wasn&#8217;t anyone new. This time around I sent out some emails and got not much response, but figured that there might be people there anyway. I was wrong. Not a big deal, communities shift over time. I guess there just aren&#8217;t many  people into the technologies looking to meet.</p>

<p>The question does still remain about the Meetup site. It doesn&#8217;t encourage people to really communicate. It&#8217;s very difficult to talk, one member to another, to try to find out what is going on. I&#8217;m sure that Meetup likes this, cause long lists of people make it look like they&#8217;re very active. Even if less than ten percent of the listed participants actually show up. So I am somewhat curious if another form of organization would help out getting people together, or are people just not interested at all? I just ran across <a href="http://www.sfbaybloggers.com/">SFBayBloggers</a> in poking around and looking to answer that question. Hard to tell from looking at that site how active it is. There do seem to be some recent entries in the discussion forums at least.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that now that blogging is passe for the technically elite, they&#8217;ve either lost interest or have started working somewhere that they do this as a job. Both normally lead to people being less interested in meeting up informally about the topic. I see the whole blogging issue as just starting out really. Sure, the geeky work of getting blogging tools up and going, and coming up with some new formats and categories of metadata is starting to mature. That is the relatively easy part though. Create some tools to make a website easy to update, big deal. Guestbooks for sites have existed almost since the first support for HTML forms in browsers, they&#8217;re pretty much the same thing. Bring up a form, write an entry, see it online. Easy.</p>

<p>The harder parts are trying to bring about the real changes that stem from this. Now that it is easy to update a website, and we do have ways to link sites together, aggregate content, and mark up individual entries; how do we actually use this system without it falling apart? And falling apart can mean anything from people losing interest, to spammers taking over commenting, to information overload making it impossible to find what you&#8217;re looking for. But as is the tradition in Silicon Valley, now that the technical problems are solved no one is interested. There is a new medium here, and there are new ways to use it. It does enable all the methods of communication that the geeks used to spout off about, but it doesn&#8217;t yet do so for the average user. It still takes a geek to be able to understand the medium well enough to work with it as envisioned. Maybe everyone thinks this is the cost of entry, and how to avoid information overloading the system. Me, I just think they&#8217;re not looking at the question at all. There are lots of unsolved problems around blogging, and a lot of them really have nothing to do with &#8220;blogging technology&#8221; at all. They have to deal with use of the data as information, use of multiple discreet points of information production being used by large bases of consumers, and basically defining a new form of media. This just isn&#8217;t interesting I guess. No wonder tech has remained in the ditches for so long. I would have hoped that the bubble bursting would have taught people that technology alone is not enough to sustain the industry. It takes connecting technology to real world problems, and then FULLY solving them. Not just pointing at a technology and saying &#8220;hey, you can use that to do what you want&#8221;. Unless it does exactly what users want it isn&#8217;t completed yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I went to <a href="http://www.vlab.org/204.cfm?eventID=40">what I thought was a panel discussion at MIT/Stanford Venture Lab</a>. The event description claimed that Whitfield Diffie was going to moderate a discussion covering topics like untapped areas of the security market and the implications of shift to a risk analysis based model for security. This is not at all what this event was. It started with Wit saying a few words about security in general, calling up mostly issues that those of us who have worked in security are already very aware of, but framing the overall security issue very well. But then it launched into a product pitch by ArcSight. I had no idea that was going to happen, and I don&#8217;t think I would have paid for the event if I had known that a big chunk of it was just a podium for someone trying to pimp their new product. ArcSight does seem to be interesting, but it&#8217;s certainly not revolutionary. Someone just had the business sense to actually write this &#8220;security nervous system&#8221; that those in the industry have been speculating about for a long time. The good ones have already written their own, possibly more than once. ArcSight decided to make a product of it, good for them. It&#8217;s a nice position, I like it, but I don&#8217;t care. If I wanted to hear about the product I would have gone to the website, not paid to hear them pitch.</p>

<p>Then the evening got into the discussion part, which I thought would be a nice general discussion, actually touching on the topics listed on the event description sheet. No, it wasn&#8217;t. It was everyone talking about ArcSight. What a pile of shit. The few times the discussion did turn towards interesting topics in security that were not ArcSight (the parallels between IDS and the immune system, can security benefit from modeling the adaptive systems found in living organisms, how does risk analysis proceed without a baseline of cost tradeoffs, etc.) it seemed to get sideswiped and dragged back to a discussion of why ArcSight is cool. And it&#8217;s doubly lame because I posted here that I was going to it and it looked interesting. Sorry about that, others who may have gone. I&#8217;m not sure if this event means that security events in the area are lame in general or not, this is the first security event which has caught my attention. Normally I go over to <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a> and/or <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/">BlackHat</a> once a year and that&#8217;s about it. So I&#8217;m going to take a look around and see what there is. In the meantime I&#8217;m trying to pull together some decent security info that IS NOT related to pimping someone&#8217;s product, in order to make up for my mistake in calling attention to this Stanford VLAB sham.  Shame on Stanford, they get points subtracted for this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joi Ito had a post yesterday that mentioned he thinks of himself as a &#8220;Social Entrepreneur&#8221;, and pointed to <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/csi/SEDefinition.html">this definition at Stanford Business School</a>. I found the commentary to be a pretty interesting overview of entrepreneurship in general. I&#8217;ve just discovered that I&#8217;m a huge Schumpeter fan, and now I see the name all over the place. I actually thought this concept of &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; that Schumpeter describes wasn&#8217;t very well known, or maybe not well accepted. I hadn&#8217;t heard it till just a few months ago. But now that I&#8217;ve read about it, and I&#8217;m looking for it, it appears all over. I have to get some of his other writings, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll enjoy those as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MyPalmLife reports today on a GPS solution from <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=229&amp;c=1">TomTom</a>, and last week there was news about an option from <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=225&amp;c=1">Navman</a>. Both of them seem to offer Bluetooth based GPS devices, which I would love to get my hands on to try out. Of course, I would be more interested in hooking the information into something like lookups against <a href="http://www.geourl.com/">GeoURL</a>. Both of those navigation options seem to be at least partially focused on being able to provide navigation to &#8220;points of interest&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure most of those won&#8217;t match up well with what I consider interesting. Of course, I won&#8217;t know if that assumption is true unless I fool around with them for a while. But the Navman at least seems to focus on static maps pulled off an SD card. Hopefully some of the people who pick up these things end up hacking at them a bit. Sounds like the Palm is really gaining potential as a platform for geolocation services.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on mobile computing stuff for a while, but I don&#8217;t normally follow developing standards that closely. Normally my work starts after other people have done the standardizing, and I have the onerous job of getting a dozen different &#8220;amazing new technologies&#8221; to all work together to do something that a normal human would want them to do. You know, like looking up a location on a map or showing you a picture of your kids getting home from school. Little details like that, normally necessary when turning technology into product (a step some people tend to forget). But quite a few people have called my attention to <a href="http://www.w3c.org/Mobile/CCPP/">this new standard from the W3C</a>. Enough people that I think I&#8217;m actually going to have to give this one an advanced reading. Supposedly it&#8217;s already being used by quite a few devices. It provides an RDF based description of device capabilities, so that a web server can tailor content to the device being used. I&#8217;ve heard that promise from a number of protocols before&#8230; but I&#8217;m trying to keep an open mind so that I can give this one a fair chance. The spec was just recently passed, just a few days ago actually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was an event close to where I lived about RSS, but I had to miss it. Looks like there&#8217;s a chance to make it up however, a webcast about RSS called <a href="http://myst-technology.com/mysmartchannels/public/item/17539">RSS Winterfest</a>. I signed up and I&#8217;ll probably drop in on some of the sessions. I wish they had a little more info about how they&#8217;re posting the summaries. I probably would have skipped the signup and just read about it, but I think participation is important if someone has put the time into setting up an event like this. So I&#8217;m going to put my realtime time into it and listen as it happens. They have some great speakers.</p>
