  <div class="entry-content"><p>While joking in the IRC channel at <a href="http://www.pilot-link.org">pilot-link</a> setuid pointed me to <a href="http://nitroracing.org/sco/comments.php?article=3207">an analysis of Darl McBride&#8217;s behavior</a>. It is a pretty funny read on its own, but what struck me after reading even a few of the quotes from Darl is that he doesn&#8217;t understand that everyone benefits from using open source, even software vendors (the competent ones at least). He seems to think that people using open source software means that the commercial software market is dead. That is not what it means at all. It means that software vendors have to ADD VALUE in what they do. It  means that they can&#8217;t just sell the same old piece of shit year after year and expect to protect their &#8220;market position&#8221; using the law. Darl thinks that he has a right to sell software because he has customers. Weird. For some reason Darl thinks that the only way that software can get written and that ideas can be formed is by people working in companies:</p>

<blockquote><p>McBride makes no bones about turning his back on the Linux community, or the fact that doing so may hurt SCO&#8217;s business. &#8220;We have customers in two camps, those who respect intellectual property, and those who don&#8217;t. We&#8217;re setting the standard. The whole world doesn&#8217;t spin around a free model. There&#8217;s no free lunch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>What a fucknut. Open source advocates don&#8217;t want to steal the technology that SCO owns. Almost everyone I know who works on open source projects wouldn&#8217;t have taken an handout from SCO even before this whole thing started. That&#8217;s because open source projects can make better software. Open source isn&#8217;t about stealing IP from others and reusing it in free projects, what it&#8217;s really about is the realization that the computer industry doesn&#8217;t do well in terms of making products. And that yes, a group of loosely affiliated people can do a better job if what they&#8217;re working towards is simply making a good set of software.</p>

<p>The basis for why this would be is laid down in <em>Innovation: The Attacker&#8217;s Advantage</em> (sorry, no link available, but you can find it on Amazon). The basic reason is that once a company has a customer base they have a set of restrictions on how they can operate and what they can do. The conclusion of the book is that someone coming into a market normally has an advantage, and that once they enter the market they lose the advantage. This is certainly true in the software industry, and it has led to companies trying to protect their market using all sorts of anti-competitive behavior. The flawed software patent and intellectual property system in the US doesn&#8217;t do anything to help the situation either. These protectionist behaviors, such as vendor lockin and file formats that are not interoperable, led many people to take interes in open source. Even if open source was initially mainly worked on by college students and individuals to try to move away from corporate control of software, more and more companies are realizing that they can work around the traditional barriers to entry placed in their way by older corporations by working with open source. Because part of their solution can be made from open source and the rest their new product, they see this as an opportunity to avoid the creation of needless overhead and focus on their core competency. This leads to leaner business plans and quicker time to market. For most people this means a maximization of their profits. They work on only the high value areas in which they can create the most value. They do less work, but they get more for the work they do.</p>

<p>For some reason Darl thinks that this is an unworkable situation. He thinks that this results in companies not being able to sell software. He thinks that groups working together to make their combined situation better is somehow &#8220;communist&#8221;. I wonder if he thinks that efforts such as those carried on at the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">W3C</a> are communist as well. Those are efforts which work to create a standard involving both multiple companies and interested individuals. There really is a strong parallel between writing a standard and producing a standard piece of software, especially if the software you&#8217;re producing is based on a standard. What happens there is that you move the bar up in terms of expectation. The more parts of a system that are standard commodity, the more a user can expect from a solution. Software providers can no longer make money off selling just a base solution. If users can get free software off the Internet, that doesn&#8217;t mean that they won&#8217;t ever buy software. It means that the software has to provide more value than the free solution. It means that software makers have to add something to the base in order to be able to charge for it. If having companies produce a standard so that they can be sure that all their parts work together makes sense, why doesn&#8217;t it make sense to have the same groups produce the parts of the system which are pure overhead? Group effort has existed for a long time, but Darl thinks that open source is wrong for allowing the maximum number of people to benefit from it. Weird.</p>

<p>I actually just started thinking through the parallel between standards authoring and authoring open source as I wrote this, and I really like it. I think it provides a strong argument against the &#8220;free lunch&#8221; argument that Darl keeps using. Open source is not a free lunch, it&#8217;s a potluck dinner. It&#8217;s a case where lots of people bringing together what they have and sharing it have managed to create something much more enjoyable than the pieces taken individually. Potluck dinners are not free however, everyone has to put something in. Sure, people may show up without a dish and be allowed to eat anyway, especially if there&#8217;s more than enough food for those already present. But potluck dinners don&#8217;t mean that there are no resturaunts. It just means that resturaunts can&#8217;t charge for food which is just as easy to make at home and the same in all other respects. Welcome to what the rest of us call a free market. Darl thinks this is communist. Weird.</p>

<p>Darl&#8217;s insistence that open source is a free lunch really shows how much he misunderstands the issue. Not that I can completely blame him for misunderstanding in the first place, even some open souce advocates don&#8217;t understand how value creation within the open source environment actually works. But he is the CEO of a major company. I would expect he would educate himself a bit. Either that, or the shareholders would rally and find a way to get him replaced. If he doesn&#8217;t see how open source would work to his shareholder&#8217;s and customer&#8217;s benefit I don&#8217;t think he should be making any decisions on their behalf at all. Yet still, with all this ineptitude, he&#8217;s still there and still blathering on. Weird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/01/23.html#a895">post by John Udell</a> about database lockin. I think the issue with SQL dialect lockin is probably more troublesome. I agree that transport independence is a problem though. Databases have been like this for a long time - a standard language to query them, but different libraries for the different databases to actually access them. There&#8217;s probably some issue in there that I&#8217;m not aware of that keeps it from happening, but why isn&#8217;t there a standard transport? ODBC is cool, but it&#8217;s a shim on the application end to allow different drivers to be swapped in as needed. At least in all the uses I have seen. Is there an &#8220;ODBC native&#8221; format that can be used by an RDBMS? I&#8217;m thinking probably not. And if so, why is no one using it? For the proprietary systems like Oracle and DB2 I could certainly see why, they don&#8217;t want people to be able to switch easily. But for open source databases why isn&#8217;t there transport level standardization? Any database gurus out there who might know the answer, please chime in. I vaguely remember something about an XML based query exchange from a number of years ago. That ever make it anywhere?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.beecon.de/howto/pose_bt/index.html">This site</a> describes how to use a physical bluetooth device from a POSE session running under Linux. That&#8217;s just really cool. I with the people actually at Palm would realize the market they lost in open source advocates, but if that isn&#8217;t going to happen at least a couple of talented people can provide an alternative. Of course, this only works for emulating older devices, Palm doesn&#8217;t have anything available for Linux to simulate their newest devices. Thank you <a href="http://www.beecon.de/index.html">BeeCon</a>, this is a great tool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There  are <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Damonv/Public/Doombolt/">images online</a> from a couple of people who constructed a high speed photo lab using a BASIC stamp and some off the shelf parts. I have no idea how expensive high speed photography normally is, or just how hard it is to construct one of these, but the pictures are pretty. I think it&#8217;s also cool they did it for $40, although I&#8217;m assuming that doesn&#8217;t include air compressor, controller, and the various cameras they used. I figured the flash would be the hard part given their description, but it says they just used the flash from a disposable. Mmmmm, impaled fruit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>RSS WinterFest is an RSS webcast that went on over the last two days. Along with the webcast went a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest/index.cgi">wiki</a> a <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest/index.cgi?action=weblog_display&amp;category=RSS%20Winterfest%20Weblog">weblog</a> and tons of other resources linked in through both of those. There are some great points brought up, and some points that I really don&#8217;t agree with but might have to put some thought into. I also found <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">Roland&#8217;s blog</a> quite useful, as he seems to be interested in a lot of the same areas as I am. I had trouble connecting to the actual cast the first day, and didn&#8217;t have the time to listen in live for most of today. I wish I could have, the information linked in and generated by the event seems to be of very high quality. This is a group that&#8217;s really taking the time to work through the issues beyond the technical details of getting down a file format. I liked the points under Syndication in the Enterprise from Bill French in particular. Once I work myself out from under the pile of crud I have to do now I need to finish up the Palm XMLPRC work and get onto some of this stuff as well.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/">Weblogger Meetup</a> in San Francisco last night, but only one other person showed up. I think that it just isn&#8217;t going to happen at all. During December lots of people showed cause the crew from <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> were there. But besides the people that <a href="http://shellen.com/">Jason Shellen</a> invited, and the people that I invited, there wasn&#8217;t anyone new. This time around I sent out some emails and got not much response, but figured that there might be people there anyway. I was wrong. Not a big deal, communities shift over time. I guess there just aren&#8217;t many  people into the technologies looking to meet.</p>

<p>The question does still remain about the Meetup site. It doesn&#8217;t encourage people to really communicate. It&#8217;s very difficult to talk, one member to another, to try to find out what is going on. I&#8217;m sure that Meetup likes this, cause long lists of people make it look like they&#8217;re very active. Even if less than ten percent of the listed participants actually show up. So I am somewhat curious if another form of organization would help out getting people together, or are people just not interested at all? I just ran across <a href="http://www.sfbaybloggers.com/">SFBayBloggers</a> in poking around and looking to answer that question. Hard to tell from looking at that site how active it is. There do seem to be some recent entries in the discussion forums at least.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that now that blogging is passe for the technically elite, they&#8217;ve either lost interest or have started working somewhere that they do this as a job. Both normally lead to people being less interested in meeting up informally about the topic. I see the whole blogging issue as just starting out really. Sure, the geeky work of getting blogging tools up and going, and coming up with some new formats and categories of metadata is starting to mature. That is the relatively easy part though. Create some tools to make a website easy to update, big deal. Guestbooks for sites have existed almost since the first support for HTML forms in browsers, they&#8217;re pretty much the same thing. Bring up a form, write an entry, see it online. Easy.</p>

<p>The harder parts are trying to bring about the real changes that stem from this. Now that it is easy to update a website, and we do have ways to link sites together, aggregate content, and mark up individual entries; how do we actually use this system without it falling apart? And falling apart can mean anything from people losing interest, to spammers taking over commenting, to information overload making it impossible to find what you&#8217;re looking for. But as is the tradition in Silicon Valley, now that the technical problems are solved no one is interested. There is a new medium here, and there are new ways to use it. It does enable all the methods of communication that the geeks used to spout off about, but it doesn&#8217;t yet do so for the average user. It still takes a geek to be able to understand the medium well enough to work with it as envisioned. Maybe everyone thinks this is the cost of entry, and how to avoid information overloading the system. Me, I just think they&#8217;re not looking at the question at all. There are lots of unsolved problems around blogging, and a lot of them really have nothing to do with &#8220;blogging technology&#8221; at all. They have to deal with use of the data as information, use of multiple discreet points of information production being used by large bases of consumers, and basically defining a new form of media. This just isn&#8217;t interesting I guess. No wonder tech has remained in the ditches for so long. I would have hoped that the bubble bursting would have taught people that technology alone is not enough to sustain the industry. It takes connecting technology to real world problems, and then FULLY solving them. Not just pointing at a technology and saying &#8220;hey, you can use that to do what you want&#8221;. Unless it does exactly what users want it isn&#8217;t completed yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I went to <a href="http://www.vlab.org/204.cfm?eventID=40">what I thought was a panel discussion at MIT/Stanford Venture Lab</a>. The event description claimed that Whitfield Diffie was going to moderate a discussion covering topics like untapped areas of the security market and the implications of shift to a risk analysis based model for security. This is not at all what this event was. It started with Wit saying a few words about security in general, calling up mostly issues that those of us who have worked in security are already very aware of, but framing the overall security issue very well. But then it launched into a product pitch by ArcSight. I had no idea that was going to happen, and I don&#8217;t think I would have paid for the event if I had known that a big chunk of it was just a podium for someone trying to pimp their new product. ArcSight does seem to be interesting, but it&#8217;s certainly not revolutionary. Someone just had the business sense to actually write this &#8220;security nervous system&#8221; that those in the industry have been speculating about for a long time. The good ones have already written their own, possibly more than once. ArcSight decided to make a product of it, good for them. It&#8217;s a nice position, I like it, but I don&#8217;t care. If I wanted to hear about the product I would have gone to the website, not paid to hear them pitch.</p>

<p>Then the evening got into the discussion part, which I thought would be a nice general discussion, actually touching on the topics listed on the event description sheet. No, it wasn&#8217;t. It was everyone talking about ArcSight. What a pile of shit. The few times the discussion did turn towards interesting topics in security that were not ArcSight (the parallels between IDS and the immune system, can security benefit from modeling the adaptive systems found in living organisms, how does risk analysis proceed without a baseline of cost tradeoffs, etc.) it seemed to get sideswiped and dragged back to a discussion of why ArcSight is cool. And it&#8217;s doubly lame because I posted here that I was going to it and it looked interesting. Sorry about that, others who may have gone. I&#8217;m not sure if this event means that security events in the area are lame in general or not, this is the first security event which has caught my attention. Normally I go over to <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a> and/or <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/">BlackHat</a> once a year and that&#8217;s about it. So I&#8217;m going to take a look around and see what there is. In the meantime I&#8217;m trying to pull together some decent security info that IS NOT related to pimping someone&#8217;s product, in order to make up for my mistake in calling attention to this Stanford VLAB sham.  Shame on Stanford, they get points subtracted for this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joi Ito had a post yesterday that mentioned he thinks of himself as a &#8220;Social Entrepreneur&#8221;, and pointed to <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/csi/SEDefinition.html">this definition at Stanford Business School</a>. I found the commentary to be a pretty interesting overview of entrepreneurship in general. I&#8217;ve just discovered that I&#8217;m a huge Schumpeter fan, and now I see the name all over the place. I actually thought this concept of &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; that Schumpeter describes wasn&#8217;t very well known, or maybe not well accepted. I hadn&#8217;t heard it till just a few months ago. But now that I&#8217;ve read about it, and I&#8217;m looking for it, it appears all over. I have to get some of his other writings, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll enjoy those as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MyPalmLife reports today on a GPS solution from <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=229&amp;c=1">TomTom</a>, and last week there was news about an option from <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=225&amp;c=1">Navman</a>. Both of them seem to offer Bluetooth based GPS devices, which I would love to get my hands on to try out. Of course, I would be more interested in hooking the information into something like lookups against <a href="http://www.geourl.com/">GeoURL</a>. Both of those navigation options seem to be at least partially focused on being able to provide navigation to &#8220;points of interest&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure most of those won&#8217;t match up well with what I consider interesting. Of course, I won&#8217;t know if that assumption is true unless I fool around with them for a while. But the Navman at least seems to focus on static maps pulled off an SD card. Hopefully some of the people who pick up these things end up hacking at them a bit. Sounds like the Palm is really gaining potential as a platform for geolocation services.</p>
