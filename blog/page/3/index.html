  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, folks really hate this <a href="http://lesserevil.ning.com/detail.php?DetailID=425486">George Bush Jr.</a> guy. You would think he roamed around in the streets killing puppies and kicking children or something. I check out the stats for <a href="http://browse.ning.com/any/miker/any/any">all my Ning apps</a> on a daily basis. Cause I&#8217;m vain, no sense in trying to justify it with anything else. And <a href="http://lesserevil.ning.com">LesserEvil</a> had a bunch of hits from Google image searches, searches for Georgie there. So I pull up his detail page and what do I see? &#8220;Cthulhu is less evil than George Bush Jr. 100% of the time.&#8221; Wow, that&#8217;s pretty evil. Or maybe it&#8217;s just interesting commentary on the mindset of folks in the &#8220;online and searching for random stuff cause I have that kind of time on my hands&#8221; segment of the population.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some <a href="http://www.tuttletimes.com/siteSearch/apstorysection/local_story_088201244.html">additional info about the politician who incorrectly threatened CentOS with FBI action</a>. Gotta love this:</p>

<blockquote><p>“This is just a bunch of freaks out there that don’t have anything better to do,” he said. “When I came in to work Monday morning, I had about 500 e-mails, plus anonymous phone calls from all the geeks out there. [CentOS is] a free operating system that this guy gives away, which tells you how much time he’s got on his hands.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nice, very nice. Unfortunately we can&#8217;t all resort to threats and scare tactics to get our work done for us. Or can we&#8230;.?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve tried out the <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/high_availability_nfs_drbd_heartbeat">high availability NFS solution detailed here</a> and run into a few issues. It does provide a great way to get a higher degree of availability for one of the most problematic bits of infrastructure, so I don&#8217;t mean to crap on the idea as a whole. But here are two issues to make sure you either check out or understand before you deploy something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We saw write throughput cut in half when DRBD was up and running. If you&#8217;ve got plenty of capacity and can segment as you grow you might be more concerned with the availability than the throughput. And it&#8217;s certainly possible that we could have performed some tuning to get DRBD to perform better. I&#8217;m just saying perform some benchmarks beforehand and afterward to make sure you&#8217;re not impacting the system too negatively without knowing it.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a block level replication technique, so there&#8217;s no guarantee that a filesystem level error that causes corruption isn&#8217;t just replicated over to the failover box as it happens. True, it&#8217;s much more common that the failure mode be bad blocks at the hardware level than an error at the OS level&#8230;. but once again this is block level replication. A bad block on the master side that goes undetected for even a single read/write cycle will have that incorrect information replicated to the slave. As far as I know (and I admit I haven&#8217;t researched this in a while) there isn&#8217;t a Linux filesystem that does end to end checksumming to prevent this kind of issue.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just two things to keep in mind. There&#8217;s some great info in that article in general, like moving the NFS runtime files out to the replicated block device and how to configure heartbeat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These SMS.ac folks just don&#8217;t know when to quit. I was chatting with <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com">Russ</a> yesterday and this morning, and he was saying that the SMS.ac people are sending him takedown letters for non-libelous content on his blog because he&#8217;s ranked pretty high in the Google search results. I told him to just take down the stuff cause it&#8217;s not worth the effort. I&#8217;m not a lawyer or anything, but I did watch Law and Order this one time and it didn&#8217;t look too hard. And then I figured, wouldn&#8217;t it be a real ball buster if a whole bunch of people <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com">linked to Russ&#8217;s blog with SMS.ac in the link text</a>, so he&#8217;s still in the top search results for them even after doing everything they ask.  I think it would be, and I think it&#8217;s like, totally justified. That&#8217;s the great thing about scammers and spammers, you can do whatever you want to them and you don&#8217;t have to feel bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like I was babbling about yesterday, I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=107">thinking about different ways of hooking up mobile applications and web applications and trying to bridge the gap</a>. One area that gets a lot of leverage relatively quickly is implementing de-facto standard web service interfaces that the mobile applications can hook up to. There are both desktop and mobile applications that interact with the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/">Blogger API</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr Services</a>, the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Yesterday while chatting with Russ I decided to try setting up an application that would accept posts from the Nokia <a href="http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog">Lifeblog</a> app. Russ pointed me at <a href="http://www.robertprice.co.uk/robblog/archive/2005/2/Lifeblog_Posting_Protocol_Example.shtml">Robert Price&#8217;s description of getting Lifeblog posting to his site</a>. Simple enough. My version is up at <a href="http://lifeblog.ning.com/">lifeblog.ning.com</a>. Although it&#8217;s currently nothing more than a sample, it&#8217;s on Ning so it&#8217;s easily clonable and hopefully will encourage some experimentation. It also shows off some interesting parts of <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a> in general.</p>

<p>One of the common misperceptions about Ning is that you can only clone the applications that we have available. That&#8217;s not true at all, and everything I did to setup the Lifeblog sample I did as a normal user of the system. Here&#8217;s a rundown of some of the general techniques and some tips for setting up a web service interface if you have an app on Ning.</p>

<p><strong>Returning Non-HTML Content</strong></p>

<p>Normally when you generate some HTML output on the Ning playground your bare content is wrapped with the xn_header.view header and standard sidebar before going back to the user&#8217;s browser. If we&#8217;re going to be generating responses to web services requests we obviously don&#8217;t want to get that stuff jammed into our responses. No problem, Ning only decorates HTML content. Just set the appropriate header to mark your output as XML and it&#8217;ll go right back out to the client unmodified. In this case I&#8217;m returning Atom responses, so I send application/atom+xml as the content type:</p>

<p><code>header( "Content-type: application/atom+xml" );</code></p>

<p><strong>Returning Non-200 HTTP Response Codes</strong></p>

<p>You can also use header() to send response codes other than 200 back in the HTTP status line. Good, cause the Atom docs for Lifeblog say that the app wants a &#8220;201 Created&#8221; response back from a successful post. Just a different form of header line, and that also makes it back to the client:</p>

<p><code>header( "HTTP/1.1 201 Created" );</code></p>

<p><strong>Appending The xn_auth=no Parameter</strong></p>

<p>Okay, this one is specific to Ning. The way we handle authentication across multiple applications all under the same ning.com domain without requiring a user to sign in for every one - while still providing security between applications - does cause a problem for this particular class of access. Normally when you make a request via browser to the Ning site a set of redirects are done to set some cookies and get a session prepared. We really don&#8217;t want to do that however, we just want to get our request through and get outta there. Once again however, <a href="http://documentation.ning.com/group.php?FAQGroup:title=General+Questions+about+Development#faq-700377">a mechanism already exists to tell the system we don&#8217;t want any of the normal session setup</a>. It was put there when we discovered problems with some RSS feed readers following the redirects, but it&#8217;ll work perfectly fine for our purposes as well. Whenever specifying an endpoint for a service there should be an xn_auth=no parameter present to prevent the redirects.</p>

<p><strong>Processing a Raw Request Using SimpleXML</strong></p>

<p>The requests that come in arrive as XML documents posted against the script we write. So, how do you read in an XML document in PHP? Normally the variables for requests are in the $<em>GET or $</em>POST variables. Well, you read in a document like this:</p>

<p><code>$data = file_get_contents('php://input');</code></p>

<p>That&#8217;s not a Ning specific thing, it&#8217;s the mechanism PHP provides to access the raw content of a POST. So, now that you&#8217;ve got the raw content how do you handle it? The easiest way is probably <a href="http://www.php.net/simplexml">SimpleXML</a>, which generally really lives up to the name:</p>

<p><code>$xml = @simplexml_load_string($data);</code></p>

<p>That parses the posted document into an object that can be used to pull the text, elements, and attributes pretty simply:</p>

<p><code>$title = (string)$xml-&gt;title;</code></p>

<p><strong>More Stuff Later</strong></p>

<p>My simple sample doesn&#8217;t really process all that it should out of the Lifeblog requests. Once I have another weekend to hack on the stuff I&#8217;ll get it doing things like aggregating the multiple requests sent for each post into a single unit for storage and display. Authentication would also be nice to support. Although I do like anyone being able to throw content in, it&#8217;s definitely not appropriate for all cases. Prudes. And that should show off some additional stuff like namespace handling in SimpleXML (which is actually <a href="http://www.zend.com/php5/articles/php5-simplexml.php#Heading3">surprisingly elegantly done</a>) and handling custom HTTP headers for dealing with WSSE. Soon&#8230; probably ;-)</p>
