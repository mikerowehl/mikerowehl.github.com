  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting yesterday I&#8217;ve seen a big upswing in the number of comments that make it through the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> plugin. I&#8217;m wondering if that&#8217;s just me, that I made it onto some new list?  Or has someone out there figured out how to beat the filters? The top ones I&#8217;m seeing seem to be ephedrine, backgammon, and sex with farm animals. The ephedrine one sounds pretty tempting&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like I was babbling about yesterday, I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=107">thinking about different ways of hooking up mobile applications and web applications and trying to bridge the gap</a>. One area that gets a lot of leverage relatively quickly is implementing de-facto standard web service interfaces that the mobile applications can hook up to. There are both desktop and mobile applications that interact with the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/">Blogger API</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr Services</a>, the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Yesterday while chatting with Russ I decided to try setting up an application that would accept posts from the Nokia <a href="http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog">Lifeblog</a> app. Russ pointed me at <a href="http://www.robertprice.co.uk/robblog/archive/2005/2/Lifeblog_Posting_Protocol_Example.shtml">Robert Price&#8217;s description of getting Lifeblog posting to his site</a>. Simple enough. My version is up at <a href="http://lifeblog.ning.com/">lifeblog.ning.com</a>. Although it&#8217;s currently nothing more than a sample, it&#8217;s on Ning so it&#8217;s easily clonable and hopefully will encourage some experimentation. It also shows off some interesting parts of <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a> in general.</p>

<p>One of the common misperceptions about Ning is that you can only clone the applications that we have available. That&#8217;s not true at all, and everything I did to setup the Lifeblog sample I did as a normal user of the system. Here&#8217;s a rundown of some of the general techniques and some tips for setting up a web service interface if you have an app on Ning.</p>

<p><strong>Returning Non-HTML Content</strong></p>

<p>Normally when you generate some HTML output on the Ning playground your bare content is wrapped with the xn_header.view header and standard sidebar before going back to the user&#8217;s browser. If we&#8217;re going to be generating responses to web services requests we obviously don&#8217;t want to get that stuff jammed into our responses. No problem, Ning only decorates HTML content. Just set the appropriate header to mark your output as XML and it&#8217;ll go right back out to the client unmodified. In this case I&#8217;m returning Atom responses, so I send application/atom+xml as the content type:</p>

<p><code>header( "Content-type: application/atom+xml" );</code></p>

<p><strong>Returning Non-200 HTTP Response Codes</strong></p>

<p>You can also use header() to send response codes other than 200 back in the HTTP status line. Good, cause the Atom docs for Lifeblog say that the app wants a &#8220;201 Created&#8221; response back from a successful post. Just a different form of header line, and that also makes it back to the client:</p>

<p><code>header( "HTTP/1.1 201 Created" );</code></p>

<p><strong>Appending The xn_auth=no Parameter</strong></p>

<p>Okay, this one is specific to Ning. The way we handle authentication across multiple applications all under the same ning.com domain without requiring a user to sign in for every one - while still providing security between applications - does cause a problem for this particular class of access. Normally when you make a request via browser to the Ning site a set of redirects are done to set some cookies and get a session prepared. We really don&#8217;t want to do that however, we just want to get our request through and get outta there. Once again however, <a href="http://documentation.ning.com/group.php?FAQGroup:title=General+Questions+about+Development#faq-700377">a mechanism already exists to tell the system we don&#8217;t want any of the normal session setup</a>. It was put there when we discovered problems with some RSS feed readers following the redirects, but it&#8217;ll work perfectly fine for our purposes as well. Whenever specifying an endpoint for a service there should be an xn_auth=no parameter present to prevent the redirects.</p>

<p><strong>Processing a Raw Request Using SimpleXML</strong></p>

<p>The requests that come in arrive as XML documents posted against the script we write. So, how do you read in an XML document in PHP? Normally the variables for requests are in the $<em>GET or $</em>POST variables. Well, you read in a document like this:</p>

<p><code>$data = file_get_contents('php://input');</code></p>

<p>That&#8217;s not a Ning specific thing, it&#8217;s the mechanism PHP provides to access the raw content of a POST. So, now that you&#8217;ve got the raw content how do you handle it? The easiest way is probably <a href="http://www.php.net/simplexml">SimpleXML</a>, which generally really lives up to the name:</p>

<p><code>$xml = @simplexml_load_string($data);</code></p>

<p>That parses the posted document into an object that can be used to pull the text, elements, and attributes pretty simply:</p>

<p><code>$title = (string)$xml-&gt;title;</code></p>

<p><strong>More Stuff Later</strong></p>

<p>My simple sample doesn&#8217;t really process all that it should out of the Lifeblog requests. Once I have another weekend to hack on the stuff I&#8217;ll get it doing things like aggregating the multiple requests sent for each post into a single unit for storage and display. Authentication would also be nice to support. Although I do like anyone being able to throw content in, it&#8217;s definitely not appropriate for all cases. Prudes. And that should show off some additional stuff like namespace handling in SimpleXML (which is actually <a href="http://www.zend.com/php5/articles/php5-simplexml.php#Heading3">surprisingly elegantly done</a>) and handling custom HTTP headers for dealing with WSSE. Soon&#8230; probably ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is pretty interesting, a <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/474088">tail call optimization decorator for Python</a>. It doesn&#8217;t work for a lot of cases.. like these ones:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>@tail_call_optimized
def even( n ):
  if n == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return odd( n - 1 )

@tail_call_optimized
def odd( n ):
  if n == 0:
    return False
  else:
    return even( n - 1 )

@tail_call_optimized
def countto( n ):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1 + countto( n - 1 )

print odd( 31 )
print countto( 31 )
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>It forced me to actually take a look at decorators in Python to figure out what was going on and why they failed though. The basic flow of the &#8220;throw an exception and catch it at a higher level&#8221; idea is easy to follow. However what it&#8217;s doing when it catches that exception at a higher level is pulling the input arguments up to the higher level and reevaluating with the new arg set, and I&#8217;m not even sure what exactly it&#8217;s doing in the case of mutual recursion, and seems to stick to only one of the functions.</p>

<p><a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1331#comment-15165">This one works for mutually recursive calls</a>, but I haven&#8217;t dug into it yet. Looks interesting though. However it doesn&#8217;t work when the return value feeds back into the recusion:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>@trampolined
def countto( n ):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1 + countto( n - 1 )

print countto( 3030 )
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The stack overflows when I try that. The scheme implementations don&#8217;t have a problem with it however:</p>

<blockquote><h1>;1> (define countto (lambda (x) (if (= x 0) 0 (+ 1 (countto (- x 1))))))</h1>

<pre><code>#;2&gt; (countto 30000)
30000
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Still, interesting stuff to dig at.</p>

If there&#8217;s anything more funny than a person in a robot suit fighting with a person in a  monkey suit, it&#8217;s a Monkey vs. Robot music video complete with crayon style title shots. We have a bit of a monkey fixation going on, which started with a rereading of the classic Onion story, <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30420">Super Monkey Collider Loses Funding</a>. Which was followed by an extended brainstorming session regarding what one could do with a large group of monkeys if one weren&#8217;t planning to slam them together at high speed. Let me tell you, with some of the big brains we have around Ning, the sky is the limit when it comes to monkey technology. Monkey based power backup systems, the million monkey literature project, and the monkey crossbar switching fabric. Great projects, I can&#8217;t wait till we get started on them! The video made me realize however that we were overlooking the use of robots&#8230;. with the <a href="http://news.com.com/Sony+puts+Aibo+to+sleep/2100-1041_3-6031649.html">Aibo folks out of work</a>, maybe we can pick them up to work on systems for the datacenter. They call me crazy because I dare to dream. Dream of a race of robotic atomic supermonsters that drink blood&#8230;.</p>

Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t read spanish, neither can I. But here&#8217;s a rough translation for dulce de leche: really fucking good. It&#8217;s kinda like caramel, but not quite. Kinda got a frosting-ish/pudding-ish consistency sorta. It&#8217;s one of those things you apparently just have to experience to understand. If someone offers you something and mentions dulce de leche, take it. It&#8217;ll send you straight into diabetic coma, but it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I frequently tell people that I can sleep just about anywhere if I&#8217;m tired enough, they don&#8217;t believe me.

<p>Not a fantastic nap, but it gets the job done. I&#8217;m thinking about trying out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">crazy ass polyphasic sleep thing</a> where you only sleep 3 or 4 hours a day in short naps. I&#8217;m only sleeping four hours a day as it is, if there&#8217;s a way to make it more effective might as well give it a try, right? And no, the 4 hours of sleep a day has <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=601">nothing to do with the coffee</a>. It started way before then. It&#8217;s insomnia. I&#8217;m usually up all night thinking about coffee.</p>
