  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465036805/002-3475634-0283206?v=glance">Interface Culture</a> has been sitting on my bookshelf at home forever, but I never tried it. I grabbed it to take on a trip with me, and I&#8217;ve been pretty happy with what I&#8217;ve read so far. The reviews on Amazon I mostly agree with, the book is a bit wordy and flowery where it doesn&#8217;t really need to be, but I do think some good points are raised. Very close to the start of the book the author begins describing the accellerated rate of media change, and the rise of spoofing and meta-commentary forms of media. He uses examples like Popup Video and Mystery Science Theatre as examples of new creations which are mostly based on spoofing or commenting on existing content. After having <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=167">heard Lessig speak about sampling and the necessity of existing content to be available for remixing</a>, this part of the book is very interesting. If I had read it before I attended the Digital Vision presentation, I don&#8217;t think I would have been impressed at all. But now that I&#8217;m already in the mindset of thinking about sampling and remixing, description from Interface Culture which I would have dismissed two weeks ago is now much more interesting. I recommend reading up a bit on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> in general (sampling and remixing in particular) and then picking up a copy of the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m done with my Austin trip, but I&#8217;m back in the airport waiting for a plane to Kansas City. Just over 24 hours at home. Enough to wash some clothes, rifle through all the equiptment and figure out what I need for the trip, nap, eat, shower, and leave. It&#8217;s been a really hectic couple of weeks. I&#8217;ve been in Palo Alto, New York, Austin, and now Kansas City. That&#8217;s why the updates here have been eratic at best. That will probably be true for the next week or so, I&#8217;ll be on site with a customer and probably quite busy. But I&#8217;m now involved with a couple of really cool new projects that should be pulling me into some unexplored areas (unexplored for me at least). Hopefully that will result in a few interesting blog updates if nothing else.</p>

<p>And a thank you to those of you who sent email saying that you missed the frequent updates. Even though my stats say you&#8217;re out there, it&#8217;s very nice to hear from you in person. I think I responded to all of them individually, but if you mailed me and I didn&#8217;t respond, I am sorry. I had some problems with my hosting provider and may have lost some emails. Please just resend if you were looking for a response but didn&#8217;t get one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell Beattie posted a bit of a rant about mobile video, which  contrasts somewhat with what I said in a previous blogging life. Or at least it seems to disagree at first, but I think we actually said the same things for the most part. I agree with his points about video clips being a dead end, except in the case of someone like <a href="http://www.mycasanetwork.com">MyCasa Network</a> which delivers a 30 second clip of someone entering the front door of your house. That 30 seconds of video is pretty interesting. And I&#8217;m sure just about all of Italy would like to get messaged the video of the last goal scored by their favorite soccer team if they aren&#8217;t able to make the game. But in general, I think the 30 second clips of news and other programming are pretty lame. However, Russell also says that streaming TV is cool. I disagree. I don&#8217;t think services like <a href="http://www.mobitv.com/">MobiTV</a> really have a strong appeal. I think his other applications are perfect, and quite insightful. True video streaming capability on handsets will change the ways that people interact, and will push the traditional boundaries of the services and networks. Many of these video applications will be cool. But streaming TV to a handset just sounds like shoehorning old media into a new format, and without a very good reason.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s important at this point to stress that there will be use of and demand for video over cellular, but that the infrastructure as a whole must be robust and flexable. An infrastructure that supports mostly just broadcasting from the provider for viewing on the handset WILL NOT be enough. And that&#8217;s what really bothers me about the TV over cellular example, I don&#8217;t think it will be representitive of the real solutions that are needed. A system that supports the handset as both producer and consumer of video, and which supports both live streaming and asyncronous messaging, and runs using well standardized and restriction free formats; that&#8217;s starting to get more towards the system I think we need.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/zestyping/36000.html">discussion of Creative Commons and some arguments against it</a> that Lessig <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001747.shtml">wrote about in his blog</a>. The discussion about Creative Commons itself is interesting. I come down very strongly on the &#8220;CC is good&#8221; side of the discussion. Some of the cypherpunks seem to be arguing that CC is bad because it encourages people to be ignorant of copyright law. I think this argument is completely flawed. As brought up in the dicussions there, reusing a license is comparable to reusing a cryptosystem. It is nice when people userstand what they&#8217;re working with. But just because people should understand how their computer works we don&#8217;t recommend they write their own operating system and then use it regularly, nor do we expect them to reimplement SSL every time they have an online transaction to carry out online. Why should they learn copyright law and licensing in order to release something to the public?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tom Peters has some <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/toms_world/observations.asp?id=102&amp;date=1/1/2004">points about offshoring</a> up on his site. I agree with a lot of the points there. One of the ones that I like the most:</p>

<blockquote><p>Workers have the ultimate stake. And thus the ultimate personal responsibility. (Think: Emerson, self-reliance.) &#8220;Workers&#8221;/we/all must &#8220;re-imagine&#8221; ourselves &#8211; take the initiative to create useful global skills, not imagine that large employers or powerful nations will protect us from the current (and future!) labor market upheavals.</p></blockquote>

<p>The common argument that I&#8217;m handed by friends and business relations when I say something like that is &#8220;the average person is incapable of retraining themselves and determining a new career path&#8221;. So now when people tell me that I can just point to Tom&#8217;s list. Tom has a lot more clout than I do, even among my friends.</p>

<p>I personally think this should be a great time for entrepreneurs. If all those people out there have ability but not the direction to be able to take off on their own, it represents a great asset. So maybe only one percent of people need the drive, and the ones who do make it hopefully end up employing the other 99 percent. It would take a while for new companies to staff up, but it would account somewhat for the cyclical nature or business here in Silicon Valley. Maybe there are people who acquire the drive and skills after one cycle, some after two, and so on. Thinking like that, it does make sense that there is so much technology work concentrated in the Valley area. The area doesn&#8217;t just create technology, or even technology workers, but technology entrepreneurs.When I went to see <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=105">Paul Saffo speak</a> he said something about each new generation of Silicon Valley not standing on the shoulders of its predecessor, but building from the rubble of the past. For this area I could certainly see how that works. Each generation turns out a few motivated people with the business smarts and battle experience necessary to drive into the next area of innovation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m visiting with some friends down in Austin. They&#8217;re big gamers, and into MMORPG in general. MMORPG stands for Massively Muliplayer Online Role Playing Game, and games like Ultima Online, The Sims, and Asheron&#8217;s Call fall into this category. They&#8217;re games which allow many people to participate in a shared space at the same time, creating what I consider to be a real virtual world. Something they showed me is a bot style system which keeps your character logged in performing simple tasks, such as casting beneficial spells on friends. I think it&#8217;s very cool, and in general a good sign for the MMORPG market in general. I know that many people have issues with bots because they&#8217;re frequently used to cheat. Many people consider the use of bots to be an unfair advantage, and that they ruin the spirit of the game. I think it&#8217;s much more important that people have crossed of the line from being just simple users to being developers. They&#8217;re looking for ways to extend and enhance the system, and they&#8217;re willing to put their own time into realizing their vision. In terms of system development, this is a good thing. When your users see new potential in your system, and see how to turn it into something more. I think it would be great if some of these games provided ways for the users to hack within the official framework. I think allowing users to hack would lead to a completely different game. Something I think would probably be a great advance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I went to a presentation by Gordon Bell at PARC. The topic of the presentation was a project called <a href="http://www.mylifebits.com">MyLifeBits</a>, which aims to be an implementation of the Memex system originally conceived by Vannevar Bush decades ago. It certainly seems like an interesting project, despite being run under the Microsoft Research umbrella. It actually sounds like a project I was involved in a number of years ago. The project we worked on didn&#8217;t make it very far. It was just too ambitious for the resources we had, and I don&#8217;t think the team did a good job of understanding the direction the founder had (myself included). Seeing a project like this starting to take form has made me review some of the stuff we worked on. A lot of new technologies for funneling data into the system, like cheap digital cameras and GPS for location info, have changed certain aspects of the system in favor of easy use. But a lot of the issues we ran into, like rapid and reliable organization and searching methods, still seem to remain.</p>

<p>I also just started to rethink the way I use my computer myself. I really do live through my computer, I do just about everthing with it. But I really don&#8217;t do all that much that &#8220;normal people&#8221; do. I&#8217;m a hacker, so I do a lot of emailing, online discussion and collaboration, downloading source and patching, and all sorts of dweeb stuff. The closest thing to normal human activity that I do is keeping my contacts and calendar in order with my PDA. And even that probably isn&#8217;t all that normal, PDAs have very small penetration.</p>

<p>But just yesterday I started talking to someone about working on a few more normal human applications. And I have to admit that I am starting to get interested. It used to be that I avoided user applications and really just wanted to play around in the guts of systems. But my recent interest in online collaboration, mobile computing, and web services have drawn me much more into this area. It may be time to dip back into some apps like this, especially if we can come up with some really interesting and innovative usage patterns that need to be supported and then find good solutions for them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got done witnessing my first presentation by Larry Lessig. That was really quite interesting. Not only was the topic engaging, and the commentary insightful, but the format of his presentation was great. I had seen posts about the &#8220;Lessig Style&#8221; of presentation before, but hearing about it is nothing like seeing it. If you get a chance to go to one of his talks, even if you&#8217;re not that interested in the topic, it could be worth it just to see the way he presents. But on to the topic of the presentation.</p>

<p>The title of the talk was Free Culture, which is the topic of his new book (soon to be released). The overall message was that restrictions on media have become more the standard than the exception, and media has become more pervasive. The result is an environment which stiffles creativity, innovation, and the desire to produce. This is one of the major goals of the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, to get more content available under a license which allows for others to create using it. This act of creating new works using existing content has come to be known generally as &#8220;remixing&#8221;. Larry spoke about the increasing scope and reach of copyright law, and said that copyright is no longer serving its main role of encouraging people to create. Copyright law is used increasingly to protect the rights of a very small sliver of society, and at a great detriment to the majority.</p>

<p>So that&#8221;s the  ten thousand foot view. If you&#8217;re really interested in the issues in general keep an eye on <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Larry&#8217;s blog</a>. I just want to summarize some of the points that interested me, and bring up some of the topics that came up in discussion.</p>

<p>Larry mentioned a sister effort called <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">iCommons</a>. It&#8217;s an effort to take the legal parts of the Creative Commons and translate and update those parts so that the license can be applied to works outside the US. Obviously other jurisdictions require different licenses, and it&#8217;s a great project, but what struck me most was that he referred to the project as &#8220;porting the creative commons license&#8221;. Porting legal code, a very interesting concept in general. Why doesn&#8217;t this happen with open source licenses? Maybe it does and I just missed it.</p>

<p>Something else he mentioned was the gap between theoretical law and practice. His example of this was a fair use case involving film. Even though film makers are allowed under the law to include images with a network TV show playing on a screen in the background, this is considered fair use. Often they don&#8217;t do it unless they can clear the rights in advance. Even if the clip would be considered fair use they might not have the money to defend that right should the copyright holder decide to challenge. This leads to the gap between what the law grants, and what actually gets practiced.</p>

<p>The last issue I want to bring up is the relationship between creative commons and the Trusted Computing Group. Trusted computing is something I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=130">wrote about recently</a>, and it would be safe to say that I find the issue a bit scary. Larry said the creative commons is really racing against TCG. I should have asked what exactly he meant by this, because I&#8217;ve thought of a couple of explantions since the talk ended. What I assumed right off the bat was that the race was based on getting enough content out in the commons that people would see the value of less protection before they completely buy into the TCG proposal. Closely related was a point about Digital Rights Management (DRM) being necessary, to which Larry&#8217;s response was that so called &#8220;piracy&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean the end of profitability. He said that at least some music companies have seen increases in their growth since the Napster came into being.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across the blog <a href="http://lemonodor.com/">LEMONODOR</a>, which has lots of info about the Lisp programming lanauge. Most of it is stuff I imagine I would never run across otherwise, and I have been trying to learn Scheme well enough that I can use <a href="http://www.lispme.de/lispme/">LispME</a> on my Palm to do small experiements while out and about. For someone with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative programming</a> so deeply ingrained in their unconscious, it&#8217;s really hard to pick up other styles. My inability to pick up the new style is indicative of me having fallen into a kind of rut in terms of my programming, so now I&#8217;m doubly resolved to be able to program effortlessly in Lisp or Scheme.</p>
