  <div class="entry-content"><p>On February 15th starting at 6pm is a Future Salon event titled <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/02/future_of_art_.html">Future of Art and Technology</a>. I&#8217;m not really familiar with any of the efforts or organizations listed there, so I&#8217;m going to learn about the stuff. For a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about hooking together biofeedback systems with the electronics commonly found at live events, spurred somewhat by reading <a href="http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/thediamondage.html">The Diamond Age</a> by Stephenson a while ago. It&#8217;s the merger of art, technology, and social systems like that which really gets my interest up. That&#8217;s one of the aspects that draws me to <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us">mobility</a>, and technologies like <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html">mesh networking</a>, <a href="http://www.tinyos.net/">TinyOS</a>, and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/29/0321219&amp;tid=158&amp;tid=172">hacking RFID to do more interesting stuff than it&#8217;s deployed to do</a>. When you allow the dialog of creation that the artist and audience engage in to compress to a realtime exchange (when the feedback loop is closed and direct) I think a state change happens. It&#8217;s a lot like the change in communication styles that happen between asyncronous and syncronous dialog everywhere else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got an email from Russ the other day saying &#8220;Hey, why isn&#8217;t your phone accepting calls?&#8221;  Sounded pretty weird, but not beyond belief, I normally have bad luck with billing systems.  I have an account at <a href="http://www.wamu.com/home.htm">Washington Mutual</a>, and for a while they seemed to be rejecting autopayments for no reason that anyone inside or outside the organization could determine.  I dialed my number from a landline and sure enough there was a message: &#8220;At the subscribers request, this line is no longer accepting incoming calls.&#8221; Very odd, I was DEFINITE I had not requested incoming calls be shut off. I logged into my Washington Mutual online system and checked the transactions on my account. Weird, it did show a payment processed to T-Mobile just the week before. So I assumed this was just some glitch in the <a href="http://www.tmobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> system and set about getting in touch with someone.</p>

<p>After trying to use their automated attendant and finding out about my bill, which depending on my position in the menu system was reported as either 164 dollars, 55 dollars, or fully paid, I was further convinced it was a glitch in their system. So I set about getting hold of a real person. That took three tries, I was dropped twice when trying to transfer out of the automated attendant. I&#8217;m not sure the exact hold time waiting for a live person, but it was a lot longer than I expected given my difficulty in getting through.</p>

<p>Once I did get through I got my answer however. It turns out my phone service got shut off because I had hit the credit limit assigned to my account. Interesting, because I have autopayment set up. The attendant informed me that this isn&#8217;t the way that autopayment works. If the balance on my account is more than my credit limit it gets shut off without notification. Their justification for this is that they gave me a letter back when I signed up for the account saying that if I had exceeded my credit limit they might shut off my phone service.</p>

<p>This had got to be the fucking stupidest thing I have ever heard of in my life. I&#8217;m just completely floored by how moronic these carriers are. First of all, an autopayment system that leaves a user without service is stupid on its own. But even once we make it past that bit of lunacy, they did this without sending me any notification. No phone call, no SMS, not even smoke signals. Yes, they did give me a letter saying they might &#8220;shut off my service without notification&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the right move in terms of customer service. I figured that meant if I got to my spending limit and they couldn&#8217;t contact me they might shut it off. That they (my phone company, the people PROVIDING ME WITH COMMUNICATION!) would shut off my phone without trying to communicate is something I didn&#8217;t even consider. How do these people expect to sell the advantages of connectedness when they ignore their channel themselves? Most companies are avoiding SMS communications because the carriers want to rape them on the service charge. But for <a href="http://www.tmobile.com">my carrier</a> not to use SMS for notification over their own network is just <a href="http://www.tmobile.com">stupidity</a>. Obviously they&#8217;ve missed the boat on the idea as a whole. With <a href="http://engadget.com/entry/6944052294116838/">3G from T-Mobile so far off on the horizon</a> and then this little gem, it&#8217;s time for me to switch carriers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/">Randy</a> seems to have some momentum going for his <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/usm.html">Universal Subscription Mechanism</a> proposal. The basic idea is that we deal with some content types specific to RSS and Atom so that the browser can shove the handling off to an external app that then push the subscribe URL into something that knows what to do with it. Not a bad idea, but I like <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=388">my idea for a subscription service</a> better. However, if people think that the proposal Randy made is the way to go I don&#8217;t want to be a bad sport. I just want things to be simple and work by default. So I hacked together a <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/usm.txt">Python USM handler</a> that works for me under Linux using <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a>. I&#8217;m on the train right now, and testing it out against a lot of feeds is a pain over this GPRS connection, so I just tried a few. Using it should be pretty simple. Right now it only handles launching a browser with the <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> subscribe URL, but the hackers out there can change that if they want I&#8217;m sure. I&#8217;ll make it config file driven with some command line options to set the subscription action at some point.</p>

<p>What I would like to do with this is have it pull both the HTML URL and subscription URL and shove that off into my Wordpress link manager &#8220;add link&#8221; function. Maybe that&#8217;ll be the next set of hacking, depending how many blogs I happen across that support USM. Mine doesn&#8217;t :-)  Guess I need the latest latest version of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>Update: I messed up the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/usm.txt">link to the code</a> before. Ooops. I probably can&#8217;t blame that on the bouncing of the train, but I&#8217;m going to try anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The most major news item in mobility yesterday seems to be <a href="http://www.symbian.com/press-office/2005/pr050202.html">the new release of Symbian OS</a>. The 9.0 version doesn&#8217;t really include many new features that affect the end user, as called out in <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101397">a post at TheFeature</a>. The USB mass storage feature will actually be pretty cool, but doesn&#8217;t really affect me all that much because I use Bluetooth to fling files over to my phone. The 3D graphics are nice to see, lots of people are really enthusiastic about the games market. But personally I&#8217;m more into the location based and alternate reality games than high framerate 3D. This release seems to concentrate a lot more on the capabilities meant for network operators, and I agree with a lot of the sentiments expressed in the article from TheFeature. There&#8217;s been a lot of  talk about the openness of mobile platforms, the most recent bump in activity seeming to start around <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101299&amp;ref=5451994">Mobile and Open</a> from Howard Rheingold (something I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=385">already commented on</a>). During the past few days I also happened across two sets of commentary from Cory Doctorow, the first an article titled <a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/computers/article/0,20967,1021279,00.html">Take Back Your Cell</a> and the second an <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101373&amp;ref=5451994">interview with Cory at TheFeature</a>. This is a drum I&#8217;ve beat plenty of times in the past, that openness is necessary for innovation. Interesting applications come from users seeing new possibilities, not from manufacturers pushing out incremental features. So I&#8217;m kinda concerned that the Symbian 9.0 release seems to be tending toward more closed instead of more open.</p>

<p>When I went to Nokia TechDays they spoke somewhat about the new OTA (Over The Air) features, but most of what they spoke about was being able to debug a malfunctioning application in the field. That part is cool. However the mention of OTA auditing, along with DRM, really makes me uneasy. Things just seem to be trending in the wrong direction in this area. I would really love to see some Linux based handsets out in the general market.  There&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php">really interesting stuff</a> working on Linux handhelds, which I think could be easily transferred to Linux handsets. Unfortunately everyone is thinking evolution and not revolution when it comes to deploying things like this. Of course the network operators aren&#8217;t going to like it very much, and the existing manufacturers view it as a threat. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t the right direction long term. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not the best outcome for the end users. Everyone is thinking within the framework of the existing business models, and that&#8217;s pretty sad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a new networking group, called <a href="http://106miles.org/">106miles</a>, operating in the Silicon Valley area. I missed the first meeting, but the second meeting is going to be February 8th at 7pm.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt from their description:</p>

<blockquote><p>106 Miles is a networking group for entrepreneurial engineers in Silicon Valley. The plan is to get together once a month in a casual atmosphere, have a couple beers and a slice, and ask questions of an invited guest who has good stories to tell about starting a tech company. It&#8217;s basically a geek kegger with a slightly more directed chat in the middle.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a> is going to be the guest, and the topic is &#8220;Third Time&#8217;s the Charm: the thrill of serial entrepreneurship&#8221;. Dave is an engaging speaker, and always seems to have really interesting things to say.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster site</a> has a new look, mostly implemented by <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/">Michael Fagan</a>. I have a horrible eye for layout and saw too many pre-1996 designs to be able to distinguish between the better of two somewhat modern options. But even considering my unrefined judgment, the new look is obviously much cleaner. For the most part it&#8217;s just an update to the look, but there are some nice effects from the refresh. The <a href="http://www.feedster.tv/">media feeds</a> seem to be updating again. There&#8217;s a lot of interest in audio and video enclosures, and I would love to be able to do more with the feeds in there. I&#8217;ve been pulling down some of the content from video blogs to put on my handset, but I&#8217;m the kind of geek who gets a kick out of that sort of thing. <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/">Steve</a> mentioned allowing attention metadata to flow into and out of mobile devices <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=411">during the talk about attention.xml this evening</a>, and that he had even spoken to <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com">Russ</a> about it. Sounds like exactly the kind of thing we should be hacking on during our little geekouts. Wondering if MP3 players and cell phones will converge? Well it&#8217;s a lot more likely if there&#8217;s good reason to get information back out of the player and into the network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Gillmor was over at the EBig RSS and Blogging SIG, talking about attention.xml. The format was pretty free form, very participatory. He was pulling people out of the audience and asking them questions. The audio should be up on ITConversations. Here are some notes.</p>

<p>He asked a question about how many people use aggregators.  About 50 percent of the people did. Bill Flitter introduced what RSS is and what role it&#8217;s playing. Then Steve goes into a description of RSS and how it&#8217;s feeding into attention.xml. Microsoft had the first syndication format, CDF - channel definition format. It was supposed to work in with the Windows desktop. There were question about Atom, but Steve thinks that&#8217;s just reinventing the wheel. The publishing part was valuable, but eventually Winer will merge in the good parts and it&#8217;ll become a new version, but it&#8217;ll still be RSS.</p>

<p>Netscape was the original source of RSS, but they got whomped my Microsoft.  Dave Winer took over custodianship of the spec. Then blogs come in, and tools for blogging start emitting RSS, we start to get lots of XML objects floating around.  As the blogosphere grew it was hart to maintain some sort of overview and keep on top of the feed. You have problems of using search, false positives, dead ends. RSS changed that equation by creating a publish/subscribe mechnism. An alert mechanism in addition to a syndication mechanism.</p>

<p>Question about who owns the RSS spec, who controls it. Steve says that the law of unintended consequences is always in play. Who owns HTML? How transparent is the technology is the real question. The great thing that Dave Winer did was allowing RSS to reach a disruptive critical mass. There are next generation questions, like how to manage the flood, how to get monetary recompense back to the authors.  SOAP is an example of how standards bodies aren&#8217;t an important factor to look at when thinking about formats. Winer says that SOAP was coopted by vendors and made more complex. Wonderful speech by Adam Bosworth on this issue talking about the properties of keeping things simple, and why simple wins, and why simple RSS will win out. Also good commentary on the dynamics of attention.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re in a stage that Steve calls the inforouter. Radio Userland raised the number of feeds on the network very quickly, that was the tipping point for RSS itself. The other major factor was the permalink and The New York Times. The permalink is a distinct URL for an individual post, so that it can still be referrenced as the site evolves. The New York Times supported this, and other publishers were forced to do the same. (This might change with The New York Times, they might pull stuff behind a paywall).</p>

<p>Effectively the browser is dead, it&#8217;ll become integrated into the inforouter. NetNewsWire exploits the webkit toolkit to have a client built in. You can go from captured RSS info and browse out of that. We&#8217;re going to move more and more into a full text feed. Raises concerns about business models, and that&#8217;s where Pheedo and others come in. And it&#8217;s one of the primary focuses of attention.xml. Fundamentally RSS is about time. It is more efficient in terms of consuming information, and it will win. Also, you can store on a local system, something you can&#8217;t do with the normal browser.</p>

<p>There is always a need for a persistent local store, to some degree. How do you preserve important information on the local client? There is need for this on both end, client and server. Once you can capture enough info, you have an information management problem.</p>

<p>The blogosphere developed the A-List, very popular bloggers. This was the first boundary intersection. People who exploited the low barrier to entry. People who hadn&#8217;t been in the field very long, but were PR or engineers. The A-List developed like a star system, it was keyed into pagerank, based on links for authority. Creates an aristocracy, that some people find annoying, and it&#8217;s destabilizing to the incumbents in the media. Transition away from the publisher being the authority to the author being the authority (like Dan Gillmor with grassroots journalism). Enterprize wuffie is also developing, like Schwartz for Sun. Uses his blog to set the tone and dominate the conversation. Keeping two steps ahead of the trade media. He&#8217;s created a lot of momentum when he comes on the Gillmor Gang, waves of executives taking blogging as a new PR/marketing tool.</p>

<p>Finally, go read the Long Tail article at Wired if you haven&#8217;t already. Dsecribes the effects of the network quite well. For example, 60 percent of Amazon revenue comes from offerings that aren&#8217;t from the blockbuster list. Sometimes servicing the tail is more efficient than servicing the head. The development of the tail to give rise to new forms of interaction that support what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<p>Sidepoint: any metadata that can flow out of an interaction is important. There should be a cloud of attention information that can flow around between different points of access.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire is an inforouter, it embedds the browser and has a database store. Take a look at the Mozilla team also, they&#8217;re comitted to supported attention.xml also.</p>

<p>Technorati was built around Dave Sifry trying to find out who was talking about him, it was the first attention engine. Feedburner also provides some attention info, and according to the info from Feedburner Bloglines has about 50% of the market. (Correction from Steve: he was talking about Bloglines not Feedburner at this point) <del>Feedburner</del>Bloglines  exposes very little info, but it does tell you how many people are subscribed to a feed. Using some of these services we can get some info about the RSS space, in terms of readership. If we are moving to a new model around RSS, this is the new pagerank. Rojo is also leaning in this direction. Currently in beta.  It&#8217;s a social network plus an aggregator, provides attention info, tracks at a more granular info.</p>

<p>Attention metadata is who you read, what parts you read, and how long you read it for.  If you know who you read and a timestamp you can figure out a priority. You need some metadata to scan to be able to figure out what to read. The most important thing is how much the news will affect us, not how well written it is. The factors of importance are highly variable and personal, and they can be tuned and improved.</p>

<p>The fundamental of RSS is that you can take less time, that really requires full text feeds. If someone in one post refers to another, that should be cached also on your machine so you can follow the conversations. Dave Sifry sighted that the pagerank/wuffie/readership is greater for full text feeds, people gravitate toward them. That&#8217;s why publishers are having issues, cause people vote with their feet, but monetizing content in RSS is hard. It&#8217;s a push and pull issue, and hasn&#8217;t settled down yet. The feed of headlines is really commoditized, there is little info different between feeds from different sources.</p>

<p>So if full text feeds are the way to go, how do people make money off of it? He pulled up Eric Rice and asked him how RSS affected him.  Eric didn&#8217;t remember his first encounter or reaction, but he knows he signed up and started playing with it at some point. But he does remember that his information consumption went up radically. Eric says he&#8217;ll probably have 750 messages when he gets home, there is a lot of information there. But he just scans sometimes. Sometimes he goes straight to specific sources, sometimes it&#8217;s all scanning. Steve calls this the window of opportunity, there is a finite window in which to deal with the information you get.  To read it, respond to it, share it. And increasing the hit rate is very valuable. Reference to podcasting and taking down time and putting it back into the window.</p>

<p>Asked Elle about the post where she said that what&#8217;s more important to her is not what she&#8217;s interested in, but filtering out what she&#8217;s not interested in. Elle said there were two points to what she reads. There&#8217;s Google News type stuff, that has an important effect of serendipity. And stuff for work, which is very pointed. Steve called out letting the system pull out false positives, as contrasted with only giving you information that you already know about. You learn more from what you didn&#8217;t expect than what you do expect.</p>

<p>As soon as we make it to &#8220;the world of RSS&#8221;, our biggest problem is the attention info, and making sure that it&#8217;s used. Having the tools know about the pagerank/attention so information that you know who has linked to what so that you can put the important stuff in your window. The problem of information overload is intractable, we&#8217;ll never have the time necessary to do all that we want. The more that we throw out automatically the more time we have to deal with what remains.</p>

<p>OPML is one of the use cases for attention, a simple case. Attention.xml would add information into that OPML style format. Assume we have some tools that track attention and exchange it. Steve has some people he reads early and often (Doc, Jon Udell, Dave Winer), those people would be high on his attention list. If all those people comment on a post, that post is probably of interest. You should be able to harness the human filtering. Technorati, Feedster and others should be able to make use of that information also, they should be able to infer results based on this information as well.</p>

<p>Question from Steve Tennent, is attention.xml providing a editorial function? Steve said no, that&#8217;s the A-List bloggers. In terms of the editorial function the value of attention is emerging the editorial info that&#8217;s present in other humans consuming information.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.codecon.org/2005/schedule.html">CodeCon schedule</a> was released yesterday. <a href="http://www.codecon.org">CodeCon</a> is a conference that runs Feb 11th thru 13th 2005 in San Francisco. I&#8217;m planning to go. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.codecon.org/2005/program.html">list of topics also</a>, if you just want to see what&#8217;s going to be talked about. What really caught my eye this time?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just digging through some old news I marked down but never read, and just noticed the <a href="http://www.commsdesign.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57700230">release of an open-source, reference SIP stack that engineers can tap when developing VoIP and other SIP-enabled equipment designs</a>. The effort seems to be progressing through an organization called <a href="http://www.sipfoundry.org/">SIPfoundry</a>. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from their mission statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mission of SIPfoundry is to promote and advance SIP-related Open Source projects. Through SIPfoundry the users, developers, and distributors of SIP based products can collectively support each other and accelerate the growth and adoption of SIP.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=329">mentioned SIP before</a>, and I&#8217;m still pretty excited about what SIP could do in the mobile environment - if it made it out into more implementations. However, I haven&#8217;t seen it out in the wild yet. Hopefully that&#8217;s just because it takes time to deploy a new capability and not because there is interest in keeping it out of the public marketplace.</p>
