  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.codecon.org/2005/schedule.html">CodeCon schedule</a> was released yesterday. <a href="http://www.codecon.org">CodeCon</a> is a conference that runs Feb 11th thru 13th 2005 in San Francisco. I&#8217;m planning to go. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.codecon.org/2005/program.html">list of topics also</a>, if you just want to see what&#8217;s going to be talked about. What really caught my eye this time? The <a href="http://mappr.com/">Mappr</a> talk, Photospace, <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/gleeper/">Ultra Gleeper</a>, the talk by <a href="http://www.2idi.com">2idi</a> about i-brokers (I saw <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/moin.cgi/FenLabalme">Fen Labalme</a> speak at a <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/01/guard_your_iden.html">Future Salon event</a> and wanted to hear more), and <a href="http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/2005/01/30/FeedParserCometh/">Kevin&#8217;s presentation on the Jakarta FeedParser</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just digging through some old news I marked down but never read, and just noticed the <a href="http://www.commsdesign.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57700230">release of an open-source, reference SIP stack that engineers can tap when developing VoIP and other SIP-enabled equipment designs</a>. The effort seems to be progressing through an organization called <a href="http://www.sipfoundry.org/">SIPfoundry</a>. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from their mission statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mission of SIPfoundry is to promote and advance SIP-related Open Source projects. Through SIPfoundry the users, developers, and distributors of SIP based products can collectively support each other and accelerate the growth and adoption of SIP.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=329">mentioned SIP before</a>, and I&#8217;m still pretty excited about what SIP could do in the mobile environment - if it made it out into more implementations. However, I haven&#8217;t seen it out in the wild yet. Hopefully that&#8217;s just because it takes time to deploy a new capability and not because there is interest in keeping it out of the public marketplace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been paying attention to the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=tagging+AND+%28+Flickr+OR+del.icio.us+OR+Buzznet+OR+Technorati+%29&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sort=date">discussions about tagging</a> (or <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=folksonomy+OR+folksonomies&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sort=date">folksonomies</a> depending on who you talk to). Some of the concepts are very appealing. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us/miker">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://mikerowehl.buzznet.com/user">Buzznet</a> long enough to understand the usage patterns there. But the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">recent addition of tagging to Technorati</a> has really opened up some new doors. I was <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/digital_identit.html">at the Future Salon chatting with Niall about some of them</a>, so I had tagging fresh in my mind when the presentation started and that seems to have kicked off a few ideas.</p>

<p>Arguably, this all has something to do with me asking <a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> if anyone else calls that big hill behind Stanford with the satellite dish on it &#8220;Satellite Hill&#8221;. That&#8217;s the question that kicked off a rather abstract discussion about naming, which led to a joke about folksonomies, and only later worked it&#8217;s way back into my conscious mind when I went back to tag my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/sets/99893/">photos from the event</a>. I found that someone else had posted images from another event using the futuresalon tag, so I did the same. Of course that means I was paying attention to the tagging I was doing and aligning my usage with others for the benefit of the commons. If I wanted to be all formal I would say something like I paid attention to the taxonomy that someone else had used and then matched myself to it. But what that really means in this case is that I was able to guess the tag that someone else used and then make use of it myself. Because of that one can now pull up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/futuresalon/">the full photoset of Future Salon pictures at Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>This is a usage pattern I would like to explore a bit more. I really like the idea of a common resource that everyone can contribute to and the concept of group action <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=351">I mentioned in the post about Mobile Media Metadata</a>. Tags present a great way to provide part of this benefit - I was able to add my photos to the pool of Future Salon images at Flickr because one of the organizational methods they have is slicing across user accounts based on tags. However one of the issues with the organizational style is that I had to figure out that tag using a very manual process. That&#8217;s just a part of the system, I accept that. Part of the advantage is that everyone has the flexibility to do anything they want, so part of the problem is the chaos that results from everyone doing anything they want. Are there some &#8220;social norms&#8221; kind of activities that we can introduce to enhance the benefit for some use cases without having to constrict the architecture? Here are a couple of ideas that I was playing with.</p>

<p>The first is using date tags. For example I tagged <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=401">my post</a> about <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/geek_wine_gathe.html">the event that Niall has proposed</a> with <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/20050131">the date on which the event is going to occur</a>. Tags like that could help organize a community calendar (I was just talking to <a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">Rayg</a> about calendar feeds the other day) as well as give people a hand when it comes to figuring out what to tag their own content. I&#8217;m not sure it would really work out, the system might collapse under the sheer weight of the postings. An important abstraction that makes this easier for the user is a &#8220;related&#8221; tags view. If you take a look at those <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/futuresalon/">Future Salon images</a> you&#8217;ll see over on the left hand side that the tag <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/paloalto/">paloalto</a> is related. Another great mechanism would be multiple tag lookup for these systems. I want to find things tagged as 20050131 and event and sanfrancisco. But now we&#8217;re talking details and not big picture, so I&#8217;m just gonna move right along.</p>

<p>Closely related to the date tags for events are geography tags for exactly the same reason.  I want to find other information about people who were at the same events that I was. However, I can tag something as sanfrancisco - but someone else at the same event might tag their content as macworld and a third person might tag Moscone. Just about all the solutions for this get very messy very quickly. We can define hierarchies of tags for locations or tag with inexact GPS coordinates. But ultimately we want to be able to set a tag for the exact position, or close to it, and search within a given area. Not possible with the current tagging systems, but possibly not that far out of line for near term evolution. A location lookup  could be used along with dates to find event postings quite well. Weird huh? That del.icio.us was created by the same guy who did geoURL? Maybe not all that weird.</p>

<p>The spam problem. There will be one, it&#8217;s happening already I&#8217;m sure. People will tag their content so that it shows up in inappropriate places. You&#8217;ll do a tag search for fluffybunnies and you&#8217;ll be greeted with a set of ads for Viagra and home refinancing. Tags add spam right back into the mix. Their ability to pull together content across user and site boundaries is their strength, and it opens them to exploit. So I was thinking about the union of social networking and tagging. For instance the ability to lookup tags from friends only. Or friends of friends of course. I was thinking about that particular union before the event. But because we were sitting in a digital identity event talking about Identity Commons, I started thinking about a <a href="http://2idi.com/">2idi</a> style system holding <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a> or <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> or <a href="http://www.opml.org/">OPML</a> info. Of course just about any news site could be greatly improved with access to OPML info. But anything that provides general tagging could potentially benefit by weighting tags from trusted sources higher than untrusted sources. This doesn&#8217;t exclude tags from sources that aren&#8217;t known - we still have the chance encounters with new info, but hopefully can filter out most of the noise from external interruptions if we&#8217;re looking for info that&#8217;s well represented within our own network. I saw some use to the identity systems before, but this example helped shed some new light. Now that I grok a few new possible forms of the system I realize that Marc has <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/12/politics_versus.html">probably had these shapes burning in his mind for quite some time</a>.</p>

<p>So where does this leave us? I think what we&#8217;re seeing is that metadata that used to be mixed into the documents as additional schemas can be broken up and added as tags. Currently we have the <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/index.jsp">Creative Commons search engine</a> for one kind of metadata, <a href="http://rubhub.com/main/">rubhub</a> for XFN searches, and geoURL used to be able to provide geographical lookups. But lets say we broke down each of those vocabularies into individual attributes and provided a relatively uniform way to represent them. Say by adding something like the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/18/TechnoTags">&#8220;scheme&#8221; field that Tim Bray mentions</a>. Now each tag has the potential to represent something almost like an RDF tuple should the user want to make use of it that way. With just a few of these schemes in use the search engine could answer a query like &#8220;give me all photos taken by my friends within 200 yards of Moscone between 1pm and 2pm yesterday&#8221;. Things could really start looking up for the <a href="http://www.tantek.com/presentations/2004etech/realworldsemanticspres.html">lower case semantic web</a>. That would be pretty sexy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Gillmor is going to be <a href="http://www.ebig.org/sig/sig.aspx?SIGid=36">speaking at the next eBig Blogging and RSS SIG meeting</a>. The topic is AttentionXML:</p>

<blockquote><p>Steve Gillmor, journalist with eWeek, will join us to talk about AttentionXML, a concept he&#8217;s been instrumental in forming.   AttentionXML is a new technology initiative that will present a richer view than that available through just a static list of rss feeds.  This new standard, still under discussion and development, will help you manage your blogroll, turning it from a list into an interactive, filtered stream of content.</p></blockquote>

<p>The event is a ways outside of my normal stomping ground, but well worth the trip.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/february-7th-2005-meeting.html">posted info about the February 7th 2005 MobileMonday meeting</a>. We have a stunning lineup of speakers this time around, I&#8217;m really excited about this.</p>

<p>We had a Mobile Hackers meeting a few days ago, but nothing really came of it. Russ asked everyone to bring some running code, but that didn&#8217;t work out so well. Some people didn&#8217;t have anything at all, some had demo apps but no code, and the hacking never really got underway. As I mentioned before I&#8217;ve started playing around with <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=392">Python on the Series 60</a>, and would like to see if I can get some tools cobbled together that scratch some of my own itches. So if you&#8217;re interested in hacking on some Python stuff snag me at the meeting and we&#8217;ll talk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/momo-tech-gathering.html">the mobile geekout tonight</a> I finally got around to installing and mucking around with <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,034-821,00.html">Python for the Series 60</a>. I haven&#8217;t had time to really explore the boundaries yet, but what I have played with has been fantastic. Check out the <a href="http://www.postneo.com/postwiki/moin.cgi/PythonForSeries60">Python for Series 60 wiki page</a> for more info. I took the Bluetooth GPS example there to fool around with. I put up <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/series60_python/bluetooth_samples_1.txt">a version of the code with indentation preserved</a>.  I&#8217;ll post more about it as I play around some. Like some info about the remote console over Bluetooth. In my estimation this beats their halfassed C++ environment and simulator. That simulator just keeps pissing me off. Every time I think I have it working something else goes wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As is probably abundantly obvious from the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">front page at Feedster</a>.  We originally expected that the downtime would be Friday afternoon, but there were some snags (I would point you to Scott Johnson&#8217;s post, but apparently it&#8217;s on the servers that are currently down, d&#8217;oh!). So this is a planned upgrade, not some crash or hack we have to deal with. The rapid growth in the number of new feeds appearing on the Internet, and the effort that <a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">Ray</a> has made to get all of them to parse and to get more of them added to the index faster, ended up overwhelming the servers. When the site comes back up hopefully it&#8217;ll be snappier and more robust, thanks in no small part to <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/?guid=20041221192907">the work that Nick Heyman has done since recently joining</a> (Nick, you need a blog so that I have something to point to when I talk about you).</p>
