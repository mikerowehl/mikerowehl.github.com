  <div class="entry-content"><p>The most major news item in mobility yesterday seems to be <a href="http://www.symbian.com/press-office/2005/pr050202.html">the new release of Symbian OS</a>. The 9.0 version doesn&#8217;t really include many new features that affect the end user, as called out in <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101397">a post at TheFeature</a>. The USB mass storage feature will actually be pretty cool, but doesn&#8217;t really affect me all that much because I use Bluetooth to fling files over to my phone. The 3D graphics are nice to see, lots of people are really enthusiastic about the games market. But personally I&#8217;m more into the location based and alternate reality games than high framerate 3D. This release seems to concentrate a lot more on the capabilities meant for network operators, and I agree with a lot of the sentiments expressed in the article from TheFeature. There&#8217;s been a lot of  talk about the openness of mobile platforms, the most recent bump in activity seeming to start around <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101299&amp;ref=5451994">Mobile and Open</a> from Howard Rheingold (something I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=385">already commented on</a>). During the past few days I also happened across two sets of commentary from Cory Doctorow, the first an article titled <a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/computers/article/0,20967,1021279,00.html">Take Back Your Cell</a> and the second an <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101373&amp;ref=5451994">interview with Cory at TheFeature</a>. This is a drum I&#8217;ve beat plenty of times in the past, that openness is necessary for innovation. Interesting applications come from users seeing new possibilities, not from manufacturers pushing out incremental features. So I&#8217;m kinda concerned that the Symbian 9.0 release seems to be tending toward more closed instead of more open.</p>

<p>When I went to Nokia TechDays they spoke somewhat about the new OTA (Over The Air) features, but most of what they spoke about was being able to debug a malfunctioning application in the field. That part is cool. However the mention of OTA auditing, along with DRM, really makes me uneasy. Things just seem to be trending in the wrong direction in this area. I would really love to see some Linux based handsets out in the general market.  There&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php">really interesting stuff</a> working on Linux handhelds, which I think could be easily transferred to Linux handsets. Unfortunately everyone is thinking evolution and not revolution when it comes to deploying things like this. Of course the network operators aren&#8217;t going to like it very much, and the existing manufacturers view it as a threat. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t the right direction long term. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not the best outcome for the end users. Everyone is thinking within the framework of the existing business models, and that&#8217;s pretty sad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a new networking group, called <a href="http://106miles.org/">106miles</a>, operating in the Silicon Valley area. I missed the first meeting, but the second meeting is going to be February 8th at 7pm.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt from their description:</p>

<blockquote><p>106 Miles is a networking group for entrepreneurial engineers in Silicon Valley. The plan is to get together once a month in a casual atmosphere, have a couple beers and a slice, and ask questions of an invited guest who has good stories to tell about starting a tech company. It&#8217;s basically a geek kegger with a slightly more directed chat in the middle.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a> is going to be the guest, and the topic is &#8220;Third Time&#8217;s the Charm: the thrill of serial entrepreneurship&#8221;. Dave is an engaging speaker, and always seems to have really interesting things to say.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster site</a> has a new look, mostly implemented by <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/">Michael Fagan</a>. I have a horrible eye for layout and saw too many pre-1996 designs to be able to distinguish between the better of two somewhat modern options. But even considering my unrefined judgment, the new look is obviously much cleaner. For the most part it&#8217;s just an update to the look, but there are some nice effects from the refresh. The <a href="http://www.feedster.tv/">media feeds</a> seem to be updating again. There&#8217;s a lot of interest in audio and video enclosures, and I would love to be able to do more with the feeds in there. I&#8217;ve been pulling down some of the content from video blogs to put on my handset, but I&#8217;m the kind of geek who gets a kick out of that sort of thing. <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/">Steve</a> mentioned allowing attention metadata to flow into and out of mobile devices <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=411">during the talk about attention.xml this evening</a>, and that he had even spoken to <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com">Russ</a> about it. Sounds like exactly the kind of thing we should be hacking on during our little geekouts. Wondering if MP3 players and cell phones will converge? Well it&#8217;s a lot more likely if there&#8217;s good reason to get information back out of the player and into the network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Gillmor was over at the EBig RSS and Blogging SIG, talking about attention.xml. The format was pretty free form, very participatory. He was pulling people out of the audience and asking them questions. The audio should be up on ITConversations. Here are some notes.</p>

<p>He asked a question about how many people use aggregators.  About 50 percent of the people did. Bill Flitter introduced what RSS is and what role it&#8217;s playing. Then Steve goes into a description of RSS and how it&#8217;s feeding into attention.xml. Microsoft had the first syndication format, CDF - channel definition format. It was supposed to work in with the Windows desktop. There were question about Atom, but Steve thinks that&#8217;s just reinventing the wheel. The publishing part was valuable, but eventually Winer will merge in the good parts and it&#8217;ll become a new version, but it&#8217;ll still be RSS.</p>

<p>Netscape was the original source of RSS, but they got whomped my Microsoft.  Dave Winer took over custodianship of the spec. Then blogs come in, and tools for blogging start emitting RSS, we start to get lots of XML objects floating around.  As the blogosphere grew it was hart to maintain some sort of overview and keep on top of the feed. You have problems of using search, false positives, dead ends. RSS changed that equation by creating a publish/subscribe mechnism. An alert mechanism in addition to a syndication mechanism.</p>

<p>Question about who owns the RSS spec, who controls it. Steve says that the law of unintended consequences is always in play. Who owns HTML? How transparent is the technology is the real question. The great thing that Dave Winer did was allowing RSS to reach a disruptive critical mass. There are next generation questions, like how to manage the flood, how to get monetary recompense back to the authors.  SOAP is an example of how standards bodies aren&#8217;t an important factor to look at when thinking about formats. Winer says that SOAP was coopted by vendors and made more complex. Wonderful speech by Adam Bosworth on this issue talking about the properties of keeping things simple, and why simple wins, and why simple RSS will win out. Also good commentary on the dynamics of attention.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re in a stage that Steve calls the inforouter. Radio Userland raised the number of feeds on the network very quickly, that was the tipping point for RSS itself. The other major factor was the permalink and The New York Times. The permalink is a distinct URL for an individual post, so that it can still be referrenced as the site evolves. The New York Times supported this, and other publishers were forced to do the same. (This might change with The New York Times, they might pull stuff behind a paywall).</p>

<p>Effectively the browser is dead, it&#8217;ll become integrated into the inforouter. NetNewsWire exploits the webkit toolkit to have a client built in. You can go from captured RSS info and browse out of that. We&#8217;re going to move more and more into a full text feed. Raises concerns about business models, and that&#8217;s where Pheedo and others come in. And it&#8217;s one of the primary focuses of attention.xml. Fundamentally RSS is about time. It is more efficient in terms of consuming information, and it will win. Also, you can store on a local system, something you can&#8217;t do with the normal browser.</p>

<p>There is always a need for a persistent local store, to some degree. How do you preserve important information on the local client? There is need for this on both end, client and server. Once you can capture enough info, you have an information management problem.</p>

<p>The blogosphere developed the A-List, very popular bloggers. This was the first boundary intersection. People who exploited the low barrier to entry. People who hadn&#8217;t been in the field very long, but were PR or engineers. The A-List developed like a star system, it was keyed into pagerank, based on links for authority. Creates an aristocracy, that some people find annoying, and it&#8217;s destabilizing to the incumbents in the media. Transition away from the publisher being the authority to the author being the authority (like Dan Gillmor with grassroots journalism). Enterprize wuffie is also developing, like Schwartz for Sun. Uses his blog to set the tone and dominate the conversation. Keeping two steps ahead of the trade media. He&#8217;s created a lot of momentum when he comes on the Gillmor Gang, waves of executives taking blogging as a new PR/marketing tool.</p>

<p>Finally, go read the Long Tail article at Wired if you haven&#8217;t already. Dsecribes the effects of the network quite well. For example, 60 percent of Amazon revenue comes from offerings that aren&#8217;t from the blockbuster list. Sometimes servicing the tail is more efficient than servicing the head. The development of the tail to give rise to new forms of interaction that support what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<p>Sidepoint: any metadata that can flow out of an interaction is important. There should be a cloud of attention information that can flow around between different points of access.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire is an inforouter, it embedds the browser and has a database store. Take a look at the Mozilla team also, they&#8217;re comitted to supported attention.xml also.</p>

<p>Technorati was built around Dave Sifry trying to find out who was talking about him, it was the first attention engine. Feedburner also provides some attention info, and according to the info from Feedburner Bloglines has about 50% of the market. (Correction from Steve: he was talking about Bloglines not Feedburner at this point) <del>Feedburner</del>Bloglines  exposes very little info, but it does tell you how many people are subscribed to a feed. Using some of these services we can get some info about the RSS space, in terms of readership. If we are moving to a new model around RSS, this is the new pagerank. Rojo is also leaning in this direction. Currently in beta.  It&#8217;s a social network plus an aggregator, provides attention info, tracks at a more granular info.</p>

<p>Attention metadata is who you read, what parts you read, and how long you read it for.  If you know who you read and a timestamp you can figure out a priority. You need some metadata to scan to be able to figure out what to read. The most important thing is how much the news will affect us, not how well written it is. The factors of importance are highly variable and personal, and they can be tuned and improved.</p>

<p>The fundamental of RSS is that you can take less time, that really requires full text feeds. If someone in one post refers to another, that should be cached also on your machine so you can follow the conversations. Dave Sifry sighted that the pagerank/wuffie/readership is greater for full text feeds, people gravitate toward them. That&#8217;s why publishers are having issues, cause people vote with their feet, but monetizing content in RSS is hard. It&#8217;s a push and pull issue, and hasn&#8217;t settled down yet. The feed of headlines is really commoditized, there is little info different between feeds from different sources.</p>

<p>So if full text feeds are the way to go, how do people make money off of it? He pulled up Eric Rice and asked him how RSS affected him.  Eric didn&#8217;t remember his first encounter or reaction, but he knows he signed up and started playing with it at some point. But he does remember that his information consumption went up radically. Eric says he&#8217;ll probably have 750 messages when he gets home, there is a lot of information there. But he just scans sometimes. Sometimes he goes straight to specific sources, sometimes it&#8217;s all scanning. Steve calls this the window of opportunity, there is a finite window in which to deal with the information you get.  To read it, respond to it, share it. And increasing the hit rate is very valuable. Reference to podcasting and taking down time and putting it back into the window.</p>

<p>Asked Elle about the post where she said that what&#8217;s more important to her is not what she&#8217;s interested in, but filtering out what she&#8217;s not interested in. Elle said there were two points to what she reads. There&#8217;s Google News type stuff, that has an important effect of serendipity. And stuff for work, which is very pointed. Steve called out letting the system pull out false positives, as contrasted with only giving you information that you already know about. You learn more from what you didn&#8217;t expect than what you do expect.</p>

<p>As soon as we make it to &#8220;the world of RSS&#8221;, our biggest problem is the attention info, and making sure that it&#8217;s used. Having the tools know about the pagerank/attention so information that you know who has linked to what so that you can put the important stuff in your window. The problem of information overload is intractable, we&#8217;ll never have the time necessary to do all that we want. The more that we throw out automatically the more time we have to deal with what remains.</p>

<p>OPML is one of the use cases for attention, a simple case. Attention.xml would add information into that OPML style format. Assume we have some tools that track attention and exchange it. Steve has some people he reads early and often (Doc, Jon Udell, Dave Winer), those people would be high on his attention list. If all those people comment on a post, that post is probably of interest. You should be able to harness the human filtering. Technorati, Feedster and others should be able to make use of that information also, they should be able to infer results based on this information as well.</p>

<p>Question from Steve Tennent, is attention.xml providing a editorial function? Steve said no, that&#8217;s the A-List bloggers. In terms of the editorial function the value of attention is emerging the editorial info that&#8217;s present in other humans consuming information.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just digging through some old news I marked down but never read, and just noticed the <a href="http://www.commsdesign.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57700230">release of an open-source, reference SIP stack that engineers can tap when developing VoIP and other SIP-enabled equipment designs</a>. The effort seems to be progressing through an organization called <a href="http://www.sipfoundry.org/">SIPfoundry</a>. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from their mission statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mission of SIPfoundry is to promote and advance SIP-related Open Source projects. Through SIPfoundry the users, developers, and distributors of SIP based products can collectively support each other and accelerate the growth and adoption of SIP.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=329">mentioned SIP before</a>, and I&#8217;m still pretty excited about what SIP could do in the mobile environment - if it made it out into more implementations. However, I haven&#8217;t seen it out in the wild yet. Hopefully that&#8217;s just because it takes time to deploy a new capability and not because there is interest in keeping it out of the public marketplace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been paying attention to the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=tagging+AND+%28+Flickr+OR+del.icio.us+OR+Buzznet+OR+Technorati+%29&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sort=date">discussions about tagging</a> (or <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=folksonomy+OR+folksonomies&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sort=date">folksonomies</a> depending on who you talk to). Some of the concepts are very appealing. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us/miker">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://mikerowehl.buzznet.com/user">Buzznet</a> long enough to understand the usage patterns there. But the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">recent addition of tagging to Technorati</a> has really opened up some new doors. I was <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/digital_identit.html">at the Future Salon chatting with Niall about some of them</a>, so I had tagging fresh in my mind when the presentation started and that seems to have kicked off a few ideas.</p>

<p>Arguably, this all has something to do with me asking <a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> if anyone else calls that big hill behind Stanford with the satellite dish on it &#8220;Satellite Hill&#8221;. That&#8217;s the question that kicked off a rather abstract discussion about naming, which led to a joke about folksonomies, and only later worked it&#8217;s way back into my conscious mind when I went back to tag my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/sets/99893/">photos from the event</a>. I found that someone else had posted images from another event using the futuresalon tag, so I did the same. Of course that means I was paying attention to the tagging I was doing and aligning my usage with others for the benefit of the commons. If I wanted to be all formal I would say something like I paid attention to the taxonomy that someone else had used and then matched myself to it. But what that really means in this case is that I was able to guess the tag that someone else used and then make use of it myself. Because of that one can now pull up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/futuresalon/">the full photoset of Future Salon pictures at Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>This is a usage pattern I would like to explore a bit more. I really like the idea of a common resource that everyone can contribute to and the concept of group action <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=351">I mentioned in the post about Mobile Media Metadata</a>. Tags present a great way to provide part of this benefit - I was able to add my photos to the pool of Future Salon images at Flickr because one of the organizational methods they have is slicing across user accounts based on tags. However one of the issues with the organizational style is that I had to figure out that tag using a very manual process. That&#8217;s just a part of the system, I accept that. Part of the advantage is that everyone has the flexibility to do anything they want, so part of the problem is the chaos that results from everyone doing anything they want. Are there some &#8220;social norms&#8221; kind of activities that we can introduce to enhance the benefit for some use cases without having to constrict the architecture? Here are a couple of ideas that I was playing with.</p>

<p>The first is using date tags. For example I tagged <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=401">my post</a> about <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/geek_wine_gathe.html">the event that Niall has proposed</a> with <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/20050131">the date on which the event is going to occur</a>. Tags like that could help organize a community calendar (I was just talking to <a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">Rayg</a> about calendar feeds the other day) as well as give people a hand when it comes to figuring out what to tag their own content. I&#8217;m not sure it would really work out, the system might collapse under the sheer weight of the postings. An important abstraction that makes this easier for the user is a &#8220;related&#8221; tags view. If you take a look at those <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/futuresalon/">Future Salon images</a> you&#8217;ll see over on the left hand side that the tag <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/paloalto/">paloalto</a> is related. Another great mechanism would be multiple tag lookup for these systems. I want to find things tagged as 20050131 and event and sanfrancisco. But now we&#8217;re talking details and not big picture, so I&#8217;m just gonna move right along.</p>

<p>Closely related to the date tags for events are geography tags for exactly the same reason.  I want to find other information about people who were at the same events that I was. However, I can tag something as sanfrancisco - but someone else at the same event might tag their content as macworld and a third person might tag Moscone. Just about all the solutions for this get very messy very quickly. We can define hierarchies of tags for locations or tag with inexact GPS coordinates. But ultimately we want to be able to set a tag for the exact position, or close to it, and search within a given area. Not possible with the current tagging systems, but possibly not that far out of line for near term evolution. A location lookup  could be used along with dates to find event postings quite well. Weird huh? That del.icio.us was created by the same guy who did geoURL? Maybe not all that weird.</p>

<p>The spam problem. There will be one, it&#8217;s happening already I&#8217;m sure. People will tag their content so that it shows up in inappropriate places. You&#8217;ll do a tag search for fluffybunnies and you&#8217;ll be greeted with a set of ads for Viagra and home refinancing. Tags add spam right back into the mix. Their ability to pull together content across user and site boundaries is their strength, and it opens them to exploit. So I was thinking about the union of social networking and tagging. For instance the ability to lookup tags from friends only. Or friends of friends of course. I was thinking about that particular union before the event. But because we were sitting in a digital identity event talking about Identity Commons, I started thinking about a <a href="http://2idi.com/">2idi</a> style system holding <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a> or <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> or <a href="http://www.opml.org/">OPML</a> info. Of course just about any news site could be greatly improved with access to OPML info. But anything that provides general tagging could potentially benefit by weighting tags from trusted sources higher than untrusted sources. This doesn&#8217;t exclude tags from sources that aren&#8217;t known - we still have the chance encounters with new info, but hopefully can filter out most of the noise from external interruptions if we&#8217;re looking for info that&#8217;s well represented within our own network. I saw some use to the identity systems before, but this example helped shed some new light. Now that I grok a few new possible forms of the system I realize that Marc has <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/12/politics_versus.html">probably had these shapes burning in his mind for quite some time</a>.</p>

<p>So where does this leave us? I think what we&#8217;re seeing is that metadata that used to be mixed into the documents as additional schemas can be broken up and added as tags. Currently we have the <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/index.jsp">Creative Commons search engine</a> for one kind of metadata, <a href="http://rubhub.com/main/">rubhub</a> for XFN searches, and geoURL used to be able to provide geographical lookups. But lets say we broke down each of those vocabularies into individual attributes and provided a relatively uniform way to represent them. Say by adding something like the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/18/TechnoTags">&#8220;scheme&#8221; field that Tim Bray mentions</a>. Now each tag has the potential to represent something almost like an RDF tuple should the user want to make use of it that way. With just a few of these schemes in use the search engine could answer a query like &#8220;give me all photos taken by my friends within 200 yards of Moscone between 1pm and 2pm yesterday&#8221;. Things could really start looking up for the <a href="http://www.tantek.com/presentations/2004etech/realworldsemanticspres.html">lower case semantic web</a>. That would be pretty sexy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was sitting at the office and thought I felt the building shaking. It might have been a truck, or the building settling, or an earthquake. So I went over to the <a href="http://quake.usgs.gov/recenteqs/latest.htm">USGS earthquake maps</a>, a very cool resource. Must  have been something other than an earthquake, but I still thought &#8220;Hey, this would be a great thing to have as RSS.&#8221; Apparently someone else thought so a while ago, cause you can find the feeds <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/rss.html">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Niall has proposed a <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/geek_wine_gathe.html">Geek Wine Gathering</a> at a place called VinoVenue right over by the Feedster offices (right by the Metreon in San Francisco). They serve tea also, not just wine. The geeky part are the machines that dispense the wine, they use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartcard">smartcards</a> to dispense an ounce of wine at a time. Though if they were really hip I could just <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38038">pay for the drinks with a wave of my hand</a>, and at the same time take that first step toward my lifelong dream of becoming a cyborg.</p>
