  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was wandering around looking for info about why it is that my old Palm m515 doesn&#8217;t work with some WAP sites, and I ran across <a href="http://www.kannel.org/">Kannel</a>, an open source WAP and SMS gateway. I still haven&#8217;t figured out what the hell the deal is with the Palm, but at least now I can pass requests through a local gateway rather than just having to rely on sniffing the requests sent to the gateway. This is one of the many annoyances of WAP, one that I had forgotten about. Your request has to go out to some third party on the Internet, who then passes the request along to the person who actually fulfills it. Not a big deal, proxies exist all over the place, right? Well, what if you&#8217;re a developer, and you suspect that the gateway you&#8217;re sending the request through is mangling it for some reason? Unless you&#8217;re running the service that you&#8217;re accessing as well, you normally can&#8217;t see that. But with Kannel, I can. So here&#8217;s throwing some props their way. I was able to download the package, compile, setup the wap gateway, and pass requests around. I still have lots of debugging to do, but at least now I can do it. Schweet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today most of my time was taken up fooling around with getting the XMLRPC library for the <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">Open Palm Environment</a> at least chugging along. It&#8217;s shaping up pretty quick, but I know it will be at least a couple of days worth of work before I have it parsing actual XMLRPC requests. Parts of this are due to my still being pretty recently returned to Palm programming. The work I&#8217;ve done on <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a> is just about the only serious Palm work I&#8217;ve done in the last 3 years or so. So I&#8217;m still getting back into it. And this is also the first time in a while that I&#8217;m starting a low level XML parser from scratch. Normally, when working on desktop systems, writing on top of the expat style stream parser interface isn&#8217;t done any more. You use a DOM based interface, or grab one of a number of existing projects and massage it into a new form.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s really what get me thinking along the lines of balancing actually doing new work with running around and looking at what others have done and then integrating it. A lot of what I do is picking up existing peices and hooking them together. Software engineering says this is good, I shouldn&#8217;t be rewriting from scratch all the time. And I&#8217;m someone who gets lots of reuse out of other people&#8217;s projects. I&#8217;ve been pounding away on getting the XMLRPC parsing working for only a few hours, and I  started wondering why I was getting frusterated with how long it was taking. It&#8217;s pretty abnormal for me to be writing something this far down the stack of operations, or at least that&#8217;s the first thing that popped to mind. But then I realized that I do a good amount of Linux device driver work, which is certainly low level. I think what has happened is that the last few weeks worth of surfing around at random, reading news, quick comments in this blog, and superficial toying with new projects has already started to take its toll with respect to my attention span. When I think back on it, as recently as 3 months ago it was normal for me to spend a whole week banging away on a new feature or two. But now spending even part of a weekend working towards something has left me on edge. That&#8217;s probably not good. What I should do is sit down and actually hack through a good chunk of the projects I&#8217;ve been mulling over. It would probably take me a few weeks almost full time just to get through 3 or 4 of them. But at least it would put me back into the right frame of mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4124">entry in Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s blog</a> regarding the evolution of software into systems that link together services running on multiple devices. I think would prove particularly beneficial for mobile computing. Personally, I don&#8217;t care for the sync-to-the-desktop model that devices like Palm handhelds try for. I would much rather see applications that allow for handhelds to serve as smaller access portals to the same applications which are used from desktops. Keeping the PDA in the role of a desktop peripheral kills much of the value I think a portable device can add. However, I do agree that most applications aren&#8217;t well suited to any other form of use currently. A move in the direction of the kinds of services that Tim describes there would get us a bit closer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3292043.stm">An article over at BBC</a> provides information from Vint Cerf. Dr. Cerf has been involved with the Internet since the very beginning, and continues to remain active in steering activities. I found his comments interesting because he also seems to think that hooking all sorts of devices to the Internet is the way of the future:</p>

<blockquote><p>He said that the first decade of the net, 1972-1982, was about designing, testing and deploying the net&#8217;s basic technologies.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second decade was about consolidation and commercialisation and the third about broad, popular use.</p>

<p>The next decade, he believes, will see the net spread even further and start to become the basic communications infrastructure for almost anything.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m certainly down with that. He goes on to talk about using naming schemes which allow for access to arbitrary namespaces, referencing <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2915.txt">Naming Authority Pointer</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3245.txt">ENUM</a> specifically. I&#8217;ve read neither of those, so I&#8217;m off to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an article at textually.org, <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/002684.htm">SMS &#8216;Smart Bracelet&#8217; for Medical Emergencies</a>, which made me think of the <a href="http://www.wherifywireless.com/prod_watches.htm">Wherify GPS watch</a> and <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2003/07/21/woznet/">the planned project called Wheels of Zeus</a> launched by Steve Wozniak. The world certainly seems to be converging on a &#8220;sensor network&#8221; view of computing, in terms of pervasive devices using wireless networking, sensors, and geolocation information in order to carry out tasks. These ideas have been around for quite a long time. I remember hearing the starry eyed pundits discussing Internet enabling just about everything back when I was in college. Most people laughed at the time, other people scrambled to figure out how to get wireless interfaces and sensors into just about everything they could get their hands on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of technology like this, and I&#8217;ve been involved in a few ventures aimed at internet enabling various technologies. So I would like to take a few moments to bring up the counterpoints I&#8217;ve encountered along the way.</p>

<p>The first issue is mostly an issue here in the US - cellular wireless is expensive and highly incompatible. Cell phone service providers might be shaping up now that users are allowed to move from one provider to another without giving up their phone number, but I wouldn&#8217;t count on too much. And the common advice handed to the cellular service companies by advisors is that they should be reaching up higher in the value chain in order to recoup their investments on infrastructure. That means they won&#8217;t be making it much easier to deploy applications without involving the service providers. Anyone who has tried to deploy applications that use SMS and MMS services should know what I mean. You have to talk to all the service provider companies that any of your users might be attached to in order to find out how to deliver messages into their networks. There is no basic equivalence between the Internet and cellular networks, and trying to build applications that span both can be difficult. Keep this in mind when looking to determine how to get geolocation information. Although the cell companies might have it in order to comply with enhanced 911 requirements, that doesn&#8217;t mean that your application will be able to use that data.</p>

<p>The second issue is privacy. This one has gotten a decent amount of attention, so I won&#8217;t harp on it too hard. But having your location information available means that others can find you. Pretty obvious. But it can be a very slippery slope. It&#8217;s very easy for today&#8217;s helpful child tracking application to turn into tomorrow&#8217;s Big Brother scare. Just look at the whole overblown <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/privacy/story/0,10801,87286,00.html">scare about the use of RFID</a>. If RFID debacle has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that there doesn&#8217;t even have to be much merit to claims of privacy concerns once the ball gets rolling.</p>

<p>The final point I would like to raise is access to information from mobile devices. For the full vision of these pervasive mobile services to be realized, users have to be able to access this information all the time. Yet deploying mobile applications is still painful. There are lots of mobile platforms, lots of competing standards to utilize and to try to comply with, and in general the devices are still constrained. What has given mobile computing a shot in the arm as of late has been 802.11 and wireless laptops. I personally think this accounts of much of the new resurgence of interest in mobile computing among the general populace. But those looking to deploy applications which will be accessed from smartphones or PDAs will find much of the same muck that existed 5 years ago, before everyone started laughing at the meer mention of using WAP. Cross platform applications targeted at mobile devices are just as difficult to build now as they were then. It can be done, but it will take a lot of effort. Don&#8217;t buy into the hype that the mobile computing world has changed, it really hasn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t underestimate the effort required if you&#8217;re looking to mobilize an application.</p>

<p>So those are my words of caution on that note. There is some cool new technology in the pipe for 2004. But for once, I would like to see applications that actually work deployed to end users, and products that are still platforms for rapid innovation not oversold too early in their lifecycle. The Big Bad Business Pundits seem to think that innovation and business can live side by side, and us technology wonks can certainly do more than we have been in order to help realize that goal.  Maybe I&#8217;ll make that my New Years resolution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/knowledge/books/book_creativedestruction.asp">Creative Destruction</a> recently, and I just wanted to share some thoughts related to the points in the book, particularly with relation to open source. The title of the book is a reference to a concept which apparently seems to stem from Joseph Schumpeter. <a href="http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/liu/english25/materials/schumpeter.html">The idea</a> is that capitalism works not so much because a set of firms competes against each other, but because radically new firms are allowed to enter and force the old ones into extinction. The new firms create a new order, but destroy the old. Critiquing the view held by economists, Schumpeter says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Economists hold a view of] competition within a rigid pattern of invariant conditions, methods of production and forms of industrial organization in particular, that practically monopolizes attention. But in capitalist reality as distinguished from its textbook picture, it is not that kind of competition which counts but the competition from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of organization (the largest-scale unit of control for instance) - competition which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>The book lays down the implications of this view of capitalism, saying that all companies underperform the market in general because they look to preserve the status quo rather than adapt with the times and adopt discontiguous changes. It makes an argument for running innovation within companies more like the way in which venture capital firms manage their money. An excellent point overall, the book makes me do the Happy Dance.</p>

<p>The points raised explain in particular how the open source movement has worked. I think that the Schumpeter theory of creative destruction explains quite succinctly why it is that projects made up of &#8220;a bunch of unpaid college students hacking in their free time&#8221; could beat the projects carried out by multimillion dollar corporations. The open source projects are allowed to follow &#8220;the market&#8221; (which in this case is the market of user need, not user money) while projects run by traditional corporations suffer from all the setbacks laid down in the Creative Destruction book. I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385501331/104-4618839-3755915?v=glance">Creative Destruction (Amazon)</a> as a general business book, but I particularly think it will be informative for business people trying to understand open source software. Once the groundwork is laid for why companies underperform the market, it is only a short step to understanding how open source projects with minimal resources can compete with corporate projects allocated orders of magnitude more funding and personnel.</p>
