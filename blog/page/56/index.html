  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3292043.stm">An article over at BBC</a> provides information from Vint Cerf. Dr. Cerf has been involved with the Internet since the very beginning, and continues to remain active in steering activities. I found his comments interesting because he also seems to think that hooking all sorts of devices to the Internet is the way of the future:</p>

<blockquote><p>He said that the first decade of the net, 1972-1982, was about designing, testing and deploying the net&#8217;s basic technologies.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second decade was about consolidation and commercialisation and the third about broad, popular use.</p>

<p>The next decade, he believes, will see the net spread even further and start to become the basic communications infrastructure for almost anything.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m certainly down with that. He goes on to talk about using naming schemes which allow for access to arbitrary namespaces, referencing <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2915.txt">Naming Authority Pointer</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3245.txt">ENUM</a> specifically. I&#8217;ve read neither of those, so I&#8217;m off to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an article at textually.org, <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/002684.htm">SMS &#8216;Smart Bracelet&#8217; for Medical Emergencies</a>, which made me think of the <a href="http://www.wherifywireless.com/prod_watches.htm">Wherify GPS watch</a> and <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2003/07/21/woznet/">the planned project called Wheels of Zeus</a> launched by Steve Wozniak. The world certainly seems to be converging on a &#8220;sensor network&#8221; view of computing, in terms of pervasive devices using wireless networking, sensors, and geolocation information in order to carry out tasks. These ideas have been around for quite a long time. I remember hearing the starry eyed pundits discussing Internet enabling just about everything back when I was in college. Most people laughed at the time, other people scrambled to figure out how to get wireless interfaces and sensors into just about everything they could get their hands on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of technology like this, and I&#8217;ve been involved in a few ventures aimed at internet enabling various technologies. So I would like to take a few moments to bring up the counterpoints I&#8217;ve encountered along the way.</p>

<p>The first issue is mostly an issue here in the US - cellular wireless is expensive and highly incompatible. Cell phone service providers might be shaping up now that users are allowed to move from one provider to another without giving up their phone number, but I wouldn&#8217;t count on too much. And the common advice handed to the cellular service companies by advisors is that they should be reaching up higher in the value chain in order to recoup their investments on infrastructure. That means they won&#8217;t be making it much easier to deploy applications without involving the service providers. Anyone who has tried to deploy applications that use SMS and MMS services should know what I mean. You have to talk to all the service provider companies that any of your users might be attached to in order to find out how to deliver messages into their networks. There is no basic equivalence between the Internet and cellular networks, and trying to build applications that span both can be difficult. Keep this in mind when looking to determine how to get geolocation information. Although the cell companies might have it in order to comply with enhanced 911 requirements, that doesn&#8217;t mean that your application will be able to use that data.</p>

<p>The second issue is privacy. This one has gotten a decent amount of attention, so I won&#8217;t harp on it too hard. But having your location information available means that others can find you. Pretty obvious. But it can be a very slippery slope. It&#8217;s very easy for today&#8217;s helpful child tracking application to turn into tomorrow&#8217;s Big Brother scare. Just look at the whole overblown <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/privacy/story/0,10801,87286,00.html">scare about the use of RFID</a>. If RFID debacle has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that there doesn&#8217;t even have to be much merit to claims of privacy concerns once the ball gets rolling.</p>

<p>The final point I would like to raise is access to information from mobile devices. For the full vision of these pervasive mobile services to be realized, users have to be able to access this information all the time. Yet deploying mobile applications is still painful. There are lots of mobile platforms, lots of competing standards to utilize and to try to comply with, and in general the devices are still constrained. What has given mobile computing a shot in the arm as of late has been 802.11 and wireless laptops. I personally think this accounts of much of the new resurgence of interest in mobile computing among the general populace. But those looking to deploy applications which will be accessed from smartphones or PDAs will find much of the same muck that existed 5 years ago, before everyone started laughing at the meer mention of using WAP. Cross platform applications targeted at mobile devices are just as difficult to build now as they were then. It can be done, but it will take a lot of effort. Don&#8217;t buy into the hype that the mobile computing world has changed, it really hasn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t underestimate the effort required if you&#8217;re looking to mobilize an application.</p>

<p>So those are my words of caution on that note. There is some cool new technology in the pipe for 2004. But for once, I would like to see applications that actually work deployed to end users, and products that are still platforms for rapid innovation not oversold too early in their lifecycle. The Big Bad Business Pundits seem to think that innovation and business can live side by side, and us technology wonks can certainly do more than we have been in order to help realize that goal.  Maybe I&#8217;ll make that my New Years resolution.</p>

This speech is supposed to focus on the role of media in the recent bubble increase and I guess maybe bursting. His point seems to be that the whole issue is media, and that computing and technology are just playing supporting roles. Could be interesting. I&#8217;ve put in my registration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/knowledge/books/book_creativedestruction.asp">Creative Destruction</a> recently, and I just wanted to share some thoughts related to the points in the book, particularly with relation to open source. The title of the book is a reference to a concept which apparently seems to stem from Joseph Schumpeter. <a href="http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/liu/english25/materials/schumpeter.html">The idea</a> is that capitalism works not so much because a set of firms competes against each other, but because radically new firms are allowed to enter and force the old ones into extinction. The new firms create a new order, but destroy the old. Critiquing the view held by economists, Schumpeter says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Economists hold a view of] competition within a rigid pattern of invariant conditions, methods of production and forms of industrial organization in particular, that practically monopolizes attention. But in capitalist reality as distinguished from its textbook picture, it is not that kind of competition which counts but the competition from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of organization (the largest-scale unit of control for instance) - competition which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>The book lays down the implications of this view of capitalism, saying that all companies underperform the market in general because they look to preserve the status quo rather than adapt with the times and adopt discontiguous changes. It makes an argument for running innovation within companies more like the way in which venture capital firms manage their money. An excellent point overall, the book makes me do the Happy Dance.</p>

<p>The points raised explain in particular how the open source movement has worked. I think that the Schumpeter theory of creative destruction explains quite succinctly why it is that projects made up of &#8220;a bunch of unpaid college students hacking in their free time&#8221; could beat the projects carried out by multimillion dollar corporations. The open source projects are allowed to follow &#8220;the market&#8221; (which in this case is the market of user need, not user money) while projects run by traditional corporations suffer from all the setbacks laid down in the Creative Destruction book. I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385501331/104-4618839-3755915?v=glance">Creative Destruction (Amazon)</a> as a general business book, but I particularly think it will be informative for business people trying to understand open source software. Once the groundwork is laid for why companies underperform the market, it is only a short step to understanding how open source projects with minimal resources can compete with corporate projects allocated orders of magnitude more funding and personnel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a post at <a href="http://techgnome.anderson-website.net/index.php?m=20031210#post-124">TechGnome</a> describing how to setup a Blog This bookmarklet and sidebar for WordPress. The WordPress forum responses seemed to indicate that there was some bookmarklet code included with WordPress already, but I haven&#8217;t  been able to find it. This version seems to work, but this is the first time that I&#8217;m going to try it out for submitting a trackback. <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/sidebar/preview.html">This page is really usefull for adding a sidebar</a>, I&#8217;ve never tried adding one before. It seems like it takes some Javascript in order to do it, and there&#8217;s no &#8220;Add this page as Sidebar&#8221; option in my version of Mozilla. Guess it&#8217;s time to grab a new copy and recompile. For the bookmarklet, you have to grab the example code and put it into a page with the correct URL filled in. Then bring up that page in Mozilla and select &#8220;Bookmark this Link&#8221; for the Blog This URL.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article4138.html">article at MozillaZine</a> listing all the happenings month by month for the Mozilla project. I use Mozilla every day, I&#8217;m a Linux user and it&#8217;s my browser of choice. But I don&#8217;t have time to follow most of the goings on with the project. It does seem like there&#8217;s an amazing amount of activity. But I can&#8217;t help but feel that much of the Mozilla development is driven too much by developers. I take a look at the huge number of projects and releases, and the different version of the same browser code (Mozilla, Galleon, FireBird), and I don&#8217;t see any benefit to users there. While at the same time I still see the same issues that used to exist, like installing plugins being a pain, lack of a calendar function, and difficult configuration of other enhanced functions. I love the application, it&#8217;s my browser of choice. I wouldn&#8217;t trade the popup-blocker feature for the world, that is a fantastic function they came up with. I would just like to see 2004 bring some usability enhancements instead of as many new features.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sure lots of people got shiny new Palm devices for whatever winter holiday it is they might celebrate. So I figured this would be a great time to pick back up the Open Palm Environment project. I started out by putting a page up <a href="http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/">as the home page at sourceforge</a> and embedding a desktop bridge for the <a href="http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope">WINKsite</a> that I created for it. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to keep working on it for a while, but there are a bunch of other contracting engagements I need to tend to also. I&#8217;ve also started cleaning the cruft out of the application downloader and there should be a build of that ready soon. After that the party invitations should go out, and we&#8217;ll see what kinda feedback we can get. Until then, feel free to drop by the site, poke around, leave some feedback, explore the little bit of content I have had time to drop in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mobile computing site <a href="http://mypalmlife.com/index.php">MyPalmLife</a> has moved to its new home. Along with the new look, there are user forums as well. There&#8217;s usually quite a bit of interesting information there, and there are going to be three posters for the blog so that&#8217;ll probably even increase some. I particularly like that the site isn&#8217;t just a bunch of Palm fan-boy postings. There&#8217;s a decent amount of bitching about how lame Palm devices can be and how companies just can&#8217;t seem to fulfill their promises. Makes me feel like I&#8217;m not quite so alone in my pissing and whining.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just met with Dave from Wireless Ink just a few days ago, so I admit I had a tip off to look for some interesting news from them. They&#8217;ve just announced that they&#8217;ve added <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?article_level1_id=177">Howard Rheingold</a> and <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?article_level1_id=176">Adam Greenfield</a> to their Advisory Board. I would be happy just to get a few minutes to talk to either of those guys. Adding people like this to the board is a strong move, and a hefty endorsement for Wireless Ink. Congratulations to the Wireless Ink team! I&#8217;ll be looking forward to seeing what the new year has in store.</p>

<p>On a more Bitsplitter specific note, I&#8217;ve been working on setting up <a href="http://winksite.com/">WINKsite</a> mobile versions of a couple of projects I&#8217;ve been working on. I&#8217;ve been cranking away on them since I got back from NY, but they&#8217;re still nowhere near ready. I&#8217;ll let you know when they&#8217;re live and kicking. As usual, I&#8217;ve probably bitten off way more than I can chew&#8230;. but hopefully at least one of them will see the light of day :-)</p>

PDAPortal is a collection of sites with content formatted in a way that displays well on PDA screens. Very convenient. I&#8217;ll have to try using this portal to look for sites instead of using the <a href="http://www.unrooted.net/hacking/palm/plucker-summaries.html">scripts I was using to massage content into a format that looked decent in Plucker</a>. These sites can either be used to suck up for offline viewing or read directly online. I&#8217;ve really had a hard time finding sites that I can view directly from my handheld, so this should be really cool.</p>
