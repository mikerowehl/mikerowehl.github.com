<p>People always suggesting things to do, WS is our way of saying &#8220;Great, those sound like great ideas, show us!&#8221; Also want to test the waters, the way that any project has a particular flavor they want to find out what kind of project the Yahoo APIs will turn into.</p>

<p>obLink: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com">http://developer.yahoo.com</a></p>

<p>Docs, SDK, Wiki, Blog, Lists. REST interface to search can be seen as just the first step, there will be more.</p>

<p>5,000 queries/day/service, IP restricted. Non-Commercial use. IP based so that you can share applications with friends, you should be able to distribute your app without causing the user to go sign up for a login or anything. If you go over your limit, you get locked out for a day.</p>

<p>Example app: <a href="http://buzz.progphp.com/">ImageSearchBuzz</a> (<a href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/33-Buzzing-the-Yahoo!-Search-Web-Services.html">desc</a>)</p>

<p>You can actually get RSS out of Yahoo searches.  The same service that outputs the API results can output RSS.  Actually, RSS is available already for the Yahoo search pages. <a href="http://api.search.yahoo.com/WebSearchService/rss/webSearch.xml?appid=yahoosearchwebrss&amp;query=bitsplitter&amp;adult_ok=1">like this</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently somewhere there&#8217;s a query based on longitute and lattitude, it&#8217;s in the documentation somewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/7020">Erik Smartt</a> about Mobile Python.</p>

<p>Apparently you can take a photo from the script, I missed what the UI looks like though.</p>

<p>import camera
i = camera.take_photo()
f.write(i)</p>

<p>I tried this out with the version of python I have and it doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s a camera module.  Maybe there&#8217;s an update?</p>

<p>The default interface to python is driven by a python script, default.py.  You can hack that to make it look whatever way you want. Erik has a tabbed interface for his version. Showed off OpenGL python also.  The code is ugly and eventually crashes the phone, but it works.</p>

<p>So what if you like scripting, but don&#8217;t like python? Someone else had sent him a demo of Perl 5.8.6 on Symbian.</p>

<p>What if you were running a webserver and mod_perl and mod_python?  With access to the hardware, access to the local from a remote browser is pretty interesting. For instance, browsing from another phone.</p>

<p>Nokia continuing to develop, focus on next gen devices and modules for core device functionality. Location info. Not looking at XML parsers and generic Python functions.</p>

<p>Question about supporting other series of devices.  Will it support series 80?  Erik says he has no idea. The port of python itself is rather generic, done as a port to Symbian.  But in order to finish up the interface it needed to be hooked into Series 60 specific stuff.</p>

<p>Someone asked about a central place to share code, Erik said there isn&#8217;t anything yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6343">Mobile Computing On the Edge</a></p>

<p>The ability to make adhoc connections that make sense to you, late binding communities. Have seen evolution of platforms and technologies that make this work over the last few years. The edge is where unexpected things happen. The center is stodgy. Nothing dynamic and interesting happens at the center.  At the edge you get communities coming together dynamically. In order to make the edge work they&#8217;ve been evolving technologies, like Java. We&#8217;re starting to see the ease of use that makes the edge available to everyone (mom).  Reliability and robustness. Performance systems that can deliver the interactions required. Scalable solutioins, partly on the device, partly back in the server room.  Also want to run disconnected. Management is bringing about tied together systems, no system admin needed, Mom can play with these things without having to be a PC expert.</p>

<p>Industry opportunities. Java, lots of devices and operators out there. Lots of vendors do. Distribution, you need to get your application out to the edge. Nokia has Preminet for that.</p>

<p>C++, Python, Java, Flash, XML stackup on the slide now.</p>

<p>Multichannel connections on the edge. Web service, Data sync, Peer to peer, Event/SMS. Bluetooth, GSM, WiFi. These should switch around as necessary.  As a developer you should have access to all these, and you should be able to tell when you switch so that you can adapt. Security environemtns, like Liberty. SMS is tied into the programming infrastructure, you can tie into events in either direction. Most interesting right now is peer 2 peer. Bluetooth and IR he mentions.. but that&#8217;s NOT all.  We want peer to peer over wide area connections! SIP! Please.  Peer 2 Peer is not just local area.</p>

<p>Middleware on the edge. It&#8217;s made a big difference in the server so far.  New is to do middleware on the device (gaming engines). You can create middleware services (API or background service) and load them directly onto the device. You can put connections to your systems right on the device. SAP is looking at this. &#8220;Exposee the value of the backend&#8230;.&#8221; Game companies also looking at this (IR chat an example). This is a new marketplace.</p>

<p>Managing the edge. Complete management infrastructure.  This is what frees mom from having to do admin.  Real time monitoring. Push and pull software (you can push without user intervention).  Reatime inspection. Remote provisioning.</p>

<p>Lots of opportunities at the edge. Go to forum nokia.</p>

<p>This was much more of a marketing pitch than I had hoped for. Awww man, I was hoping for more.</p>

<p>Cobbled together a lab, teachers loved it, trouble was there was no fileserver.  District has a &#8220;master plan&#8221;, but they currently don&#8217;t have fileservers.  Tried pen drives, but that wasn&#8217;t optimal.  Learned about wikis.  Didn&#8217;t want it out in the public. District didn&#8217;t like to have servers on the premisis.  Would need their own tech support.  Ran across instiki.  Teachers have ibooks, instiki is installed in there, they got a bit of training and configured it to use rendezvous. The work lives on the ibook, the teacher can close the book down and take the work home with them to review.</p>

<p>Teachers and students have been able to pick it up very quickly.  When the teacher shuts down the work is safe. Problems are with the teachers laptop going to sleep, the laptop not being there when teachers are out.</p>

<p>What would be intesting?  Having the lesson plan populate template pages for the class and each student. There is a student information silo however, this is a general problem with any tool you want to use in a school.  SchoolTool is an open source project to create an admin platform for schools. Untimately aimed at developing world.  Web services, hackable. Once you have the services open source tying together a wiki and the online admin info is simple.</p>

<p>SchoolBell is a calendar system for small groups of all types.  It&#8217;s been pulled out of SchoolTool and released on it&#8217;s own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6113">talk that Clay gave</a> mentioned the hackability of cell phones as a platform. Good to hear in an environment like this. Having Python released is a step in the right direction, but I think for the most part people just laugh still when I talk about lowering the barrier for people to experiment with their phones. There are some great hacks that are showing up, but they&#8217;re the exception and relatively few and far between. It&#8217;s not enough to just have the ability to play with this stuff, it&#8217;s making it easy to do so. Lots of people with good ideas about how to make mobility more useful and pervasive currently ARE NOT working on mobility. They&#8217;re doing all the things that would be made more interesting by adding a mobile component. And they&#8217;re not going to take weeks to figure out how to write simple little shims to make their phone interact with everything else online. Lowering the barrier allows those people with ideas (instead of just time) to participate in evolving the medium.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6329">Folksonomies</a></p>

<p>Why did you add it? What did you see that you didn&#8217;t expect?</p>

<p>Tags are more like noting properties than putting in buckets.</p>

<p>Originally built in text file with links, and starting putting a short text after the link, so he could ie. find all wifi links. That was the first use of tags.  And then he built the web version of it, and it was still single user. Later decided to make it multiplayer. Interesting that there&#8217;s behavior of the group that has nothing to do with categories.  Example is the &#8220;toread&#8221; tag.</p>

<p>Missed the question.</p>

<p>Some things have a clear category, for others it&#8217;s very nebulous. Contrasting the need for consensus in wikipedia with &#8220;everyone having their own space&#8221; in del.icio.us. Contrast between people tagging photos for their own use for &#8220;ETech2005&#8221; when everyone else wants photos OF ETech 2005, and the pull between personal use and group use for something like Flickr.</p>

<p>Talk about the &#8220;circle in square&#8221; photos, tags which become a root for community and conversations. Another example was the glow project, pictures of stuff that&#8217;s glowing. Why the difference between groups and tags?  Groups have permissions, different controls.</p>

<p>Canter asks about connecting tags together. How can we move tags around.  Talk about exchanging database dumps at the minimum.  That data is useful in many places. Joshua says 190K tags about, a lot of them single use. Provide tools to allow people to &#8220;trim the hedges&#8221;.  As for shared tags, there are different axis of what you&#8217;re tagging, why, when it happens, who it&#8217;s for. In flickr you tag mostly for you, technorati tagging is mostly for others.  Not all tags are the same thing.  Saying they should all plug together doesn&#8217;t make too much sense, impedence mismatch.</p>

<p>A small group of domain experts can&#8217;t compete with a large group of self monitoring people when it comes to creating a category system.  Paid people also act much different than volunteers.</p>

<p>How much metadata do we need about tags?  Who created it, what tool created it, language, etc?</p>

<p>If you encumber them it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Tags are popular because they&#8217;re easy, have a low barrier to use. Flickr says that analysis is fine, but requiring more from the user is bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/5907">ETech talk from the founder of Wikipedia</a>.
 Wikipedia addresses the original dream of the internet: people sharing information. The early services worked well for a while. There were some problems though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>quality control</p></li>
<li><p>the information is the view of one individual</p></li>
<li><p>Author fatigue, the author gets bored and the page is a dead spot on the web</p></li>
</ul>


<p>wikicities, 170 communities online, free license. For profit, portion of profits to to wikimedia foundation. Having the information for the community managed via wiki overcomes those major problems that plagued sites like geocities. Relies on the kind of social model that arose from the Wikipedia. Software does not enforce social rules, the rules aren&#8217;t even set down in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wikipedia is a social innovation.</p></li>
<li><p>This social innocation will spread to other areas beyond encyclo</p></li>
<li><p>Software which enables colloboration is the future of the net</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Down at Etech right now, Cory says that the notes from <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/5910">his talk</a> are going to be up online after the conf. He&#8217;s talking about how creating an alternative email system that cuts out the abuses would ruin a lot of the applications built on and around email. But there are other systems (like DVD) that work in the restricted way by default. &#8220;Entrepreneurial organisms&#8221; compared to parasites, it&#8217;s pretty funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m heading down to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETech</a> tomorrow for the day. I wanted to go to <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> but didn&#8217;t get a chance to, and hadn&#8217;t made plans for ETech cause it seemed like things were too busy.  But then Russ decided to go down just for the day, and said &#8220;Come on! One day&#8230;&#8221; Yea, what&#8217;s one day?*  I haven&#8217;t been to an ETech before, and I hear they&#8217;re great. And there are other folks down there looking to start up their own versions of <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a> in other places. It would be great to get a chance to meet up with them. And then Elle decided to go also, and convinced me it was worth going as well.  So, two (Russ and Elle) and one (me). I can argue that I was outnumbered. We&#8217;ll be down there tomorrow, March 16th, probably causing some kinda ruckus in the hallways and lobby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two great bits of info about RSS over at Small Bussiness Trends: <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/2005/03/rss-and-marketing.html">RSS and Marketing</a> and <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-2005-year-of-rss.html">Is 2005 the Year of RSS?</a> I&#8217;m a big aggregator fan. Without my feedreader I would have a much harder time pulling together and sorting through the information I want. But I&#8217;m a geek, and I know there are tons of great reasons to be producing content as RSS that have nothing to do with information overload and trying to follow a fast moving industry. Here&#8217;s what was probably my favorite bit in there:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the other hand, for content publishers and average Web surfers, it&#8217;s a heady time. We&#8217;re about to have a smorgasbord of choice laid at our feet. And given the price points of online services these days, many will be low cost or free.</p></blockquote>

<p>Regardless of which companies make it, content publishers and content consumers will be better off. We&#8217;ll end up with powerful new RSS services that we can barely conceive of today, because they are still a glimmer in some entrepreneur&#8217;s eye. We will use them for marketing and public relations. And the way we access and consume online information will be revolutionized.</p>

<p>In many ways I find RSS more exciting than the blog phenomenom. I think RSS has even more business potential. And so far we&#8217;ve only seen the tip of the iceberg of what RSS can do.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s definitely true. When I take a look at the great things going on in the <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/">Podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.videoblogging.info/">Videoblogging</a> communities I&#8217;m just blown away. The advances in these areas really have nothing to do with the advances of the tools used to make the content, it all has to do with the delivery. Internet radio has been around for a long time. The transformative piece is really RSS, the delivery mechanism that lets anyone pull together their personal set of programming from whatever sources they want automatically. It reintroduces the concept of a &#8220;channel&#8221; or &#8220;station&#8221;, but at a much different granularity than television and radio normally allow. The print parallel is the newspaper turning into your feed reader. The common thread is control for the user. That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>

<p>However the reasons the newspapers and television channels and radio stations existed in the first place is so that an expert could apply some degree of editorialization and enforce standards of quality. I still think that the average consumer can&#8217;t be bothered to deal with digging up feeds. The infojunkies and audiophiles and videophiles, we&#8217;re happy we can dig up exactly what we want and we&#8217;re willing to put time into it. Most people don&#8217;t want to spend that time however. They need good directories, and recommendation systems, and tools that incorporate information like <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml">attentionxml</a> so seemlessly that no one even knows attentionxml is there (which is good, cause I don&#8217;t think I could tell you what attentionxml is if I saw it, I just know what it&#8217;s supposed to do). I do agree that RSS is more than just reading feeds in an aggregator, but part of that is because the aggregator is presently a pretty blunt tool compared to what it could be.</p>
