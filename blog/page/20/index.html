<p>Why did you add it? What did you see that you didn&#8217;t expect?</p>

<p>Tags are more like noting properties than putting in buckets.</p>

<p>Originally built in text file with links, and starting putting a short text after the link, so he could ie. find all wifi links. That was the first use of tags.  And then he built the web version of it, and it was still single user. Later decided to make it multiplayer. Interesting that there&#8217;s behavior of the group that has nothing to do with categories.  Example is the &#8220;toread&#8221; tag.</p>

<p>Missed the question.</p>

<p>Some things have a clear category, for others it&#8217;s very nebulous. Contrasting the need for consensus in wikipedia with &#8220;everyone having their own space&#8221; in del.icio.us. Contrast between people tagging photos for their own use for &#8220;ETech2005&#8221; when everyone else wants photos OF ETech 2005, and the pull between personal use and group use for something like Flickr.</p>

<p>Talk about the &#8220;circle in square&#8221; photos, tags which become a root for community and conversations. Another example was the glow project, pictures of stuff that&#8217;s glowing. Why the difference between groups and tags?  Groups have permissions, different controls.</p>

<p>Canter asks about connecting tags together. How can we move tags around.  Talk about exchanging database dumps at the minimum.  That data is useful in many places. Joshua says 190K tags about, a lot of them single use. Provide tools to allow people to &#8220;trim the hedges&#8221;.  As for shared tags, there are different axis of what you&#8217;re tagging, why, when it happens, who it&#8217;s for. In flickr you tag mostly for you, technorati tagging is mostly for others.  Not all tags are the same thing.  Saying they should all plug together doesn&#8217;t make too much sense, impedence mismatch.</p>

<p>A small group of domain experts can&#8217;t compete with a large group of self monitoring people when it comes to creating a category system.  Paid people also act much different than volunteers.</p>

<p>How much metadata do we need about tags?  Who created it, what tool created it, language, etc?</p>

<p>If you encumber them it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Tags are popular because they&#8217;re easy, have a low barrier to use. Flickr says that analysis is fine, but requiring more from the user is bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/5907">ETech talk from the founder of Wikipedia</a>.
 Wikipedia addresses the original dream of the internet: people sharing information. The early services worked well for a while. There were some problems though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>quality control</p></li>
<li><p>the information is the view of one individual</p></li>
<li><p>Author fatigue, the author gets bored and the page is a dead spot on the web</p></li>
</ul>


<p>wikicities, 170 communities online, free license. For profit, portion of profits to to wikimedia foundation. Having the information for the community managed via wiki overcomes those major problems that plagued sites like geocities. Relies on the kind of social model that arose from the Wikipedia. Software does not enforce social rules, the rules aren&#8217;t even set down in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wikipedia is a social innovation.</p></li>
<li><p>This social innocation will spread to other areas beyond encyclo</p></li>
<li><p>Software which enables colloboration is the future of the net</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Down at Etech right now, Cory says that the notes from <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/5910">his talk</a> are going to be up online after the conf. He&#8217;s talking about how creating an alternative email system that cuts out the abuses would ruin a lot of the applications built on and around email. But there are other systems (like DVD) that work in the restricted way by default. &#8220;Entrepreneurial organisms&#8221; compared to parasites, it&#8217;s pretty funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m heading down to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETech</a> tomorrow for the day. I wanted to go to <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> but didn&#8217;t get a chance to, and hadn&#8217;t made plans for ETech cause it seemed like things were too busy.  But then Russ decided to go down just for the day, and said &#8220;Come on! One day&#8230;&#8221; Yea, what&#8217;s one day?*  I haven&#8217;t been to an ETech before, and I hear they&#8217;re great. And there are other folks down there looking to start up their own versions of <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a> in other places. It would be great to get a chance to meet up with them. And then Elle decided to go also, and convinced me it was worth going as well.  So, two (Russ and Elle) and one (me). I can argue that I was outnumbered. We&#8217;ll be down there tomorrow, March 16th, probably causing some kinda ruckus in the hallways and lobby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two great bits of info about RSS over at Small Bussiness Trends: <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/2005/03/rss-and-marketing.html">RSS and Marketing</a> and <a href="http://www.smallbusinesses.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-2005-year-of-rss.html">Is 2005 the Year of RSS?</a> I&#8217;m a big aggregator fan. Without my feedreader I would have a much harder time pulling together and sorting through the information I want. But I&#8217;m a geek, and I know there are tons of great reasons to be producing content as RSS that have nothing to do with information overload and trying to follow a fast moving industry. Here&#8217;s what was probably my favorite bit in there:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the other hand, for content publishers and average Web surfers, it&#8217;s a heady time. We&#8217;re about to have a smorgasbord of choice laid at our feet. And given the price points of online services these days, many will be low cost or free.</p></blockquote>

<p>Regardless of which companies make it, content publishers and content consumers will be better off. We&#8217;ll end up with powerful new RSS services that we can barely conceive of today, because they are still a glimmer in some entrepreneur&#8217;s eye. We will use them for marketing and public relations. And the way we access and consume online information will be revolutionized.</p>

<p>In many ways I find RSS more exciting than the blog phenomenom. I think RSS has even more business potential. And so far we&#8217;ve only seen the tip of the iceberg of what RSS can do.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s definitely true. When I take a look at the great things going on in the <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/">Podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.videoblogging.info/">Videoblogging</a> communities I&#8217;m just blown away. The advances in these areas really have nothing to do with the advances of the tools used to make the content, it all has to do with the delivery. Internet radio has been around for a long time. The transformative piece is really RSS, the delivery mechanism that lets anyone pull together their personal set of programming from whatever sources they want automatically. It reintroduces the concept of a &#8220;channel&#8221; or &#8220;station&#8221;, but at a much different granularity than television and radio normally allow. The print parallel is the newspaper turning into your feed reader. The common thread is control for the user. That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>

<p>However the reasons the newspapers and television channels and radio stations existed in the first place is so that an expert could apply some degree of editorialization and enforce standards of quality. I still think that the average consumer can&#8217;t be bothered to deal with digging up feeds. The infojunkies and audiophiles and videophiles, we&#8217;re happy we can dig up exactly what we want and we&#8217;re willing to put time into it. Most people don&#8217;t want to spend that time however. They need good directories, and recommendation systems, and tools that incorporate information like <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml">attentionxml</a> so seemlessly that no one even knows attentionxml is there (which is good, cause I don&#8217;t think I could tell you what attentionxml is if I saw it, I just know what it&#8217;s supposed to do). I do agree that RSS is more than just reading feeds in an aggregator, but part of that is because the aggregator is presently a pretty blunt tool compared to what it could be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to see a presentation at SDForum&#8217;s Emerging Technology SIG just a little while after <a href="http://www.jotspot.com">JotSpot</a> launched. Joe Kraus spoke about the long tail of software development, and how trends like <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html">situated software</a> pointed to there being room for lots of small applications with small groups of users. He compared the curve of potential number of applications to number of users for those applications with the curve of search queries to Excite and the number of people running them. I think everyone is familiar with the long tail analogy by now, but back then it was still sinking in for a lot of us. Lots of people look at me like I have two heads when I try to describe the fact that JotSpot is going after the long tail of software development - maybe I was describing it wrong. Now I have something else to point people to however, cause <a href="http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2005/03/the_long_tail_o.html">that presentation</a> is now online. It&#8217;s probably a good viewpoint to read over for anyone doing web software development, no matter where you stand on the whole &#8220;long tail&#8221; theory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html">Paul Graham&#8217;s take on running a startup</a>. It seems like almost everything I read online these days is either relatively short or I just don&#8217;t finish it. The stuff that Paul Graham writes tends to keep my attention all the way through however. Do I agree with everything in there? No. But it strikes me as a very honest evaluation of his experiences and a great glimpse into his reasoning. That&#8217;s all I think anyone can ever realistically expect. Of course the bits about prototyping and building your early versions for flexibility and agility are right up my alley. At the <a href="http://106miles.blogspot.com/2005/03/march-meeting-recap.html">March 106Miles meeting</a> there were a lot of questions about early stage valuation. Here&#8217;s how Graham answers that one:</p>

<blockquote><p>How do you decide what the value of the company should be? There is no rational way. At this stage the company is just a bet. I didn&#8217;t realize that when we were raising seed money. Julian, our lawyer, thought we ought to value the company at several million dollars. I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth several million dollars. Eventually we settled on one millon, because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation any lower.</p></blockquote>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn&#8217;t just the value of the code we&#8217;d written so far. It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future work we&#8217;d do, which turned out to be a lot.</p>

<p>Something else that caught my attention in there:</p>

<blockquote><p>No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want. The only kind of software you can build without studying users is the sort for which you are the typical user. But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on. So if you&#8217;re developing technology for money, you&#8217;re probably not going to be developing it for people like you. Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?</p></blockquote>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve consistently heard from the greatest number of people talking about startups, it would be to engage with customers early and learn to listen to them. When Graham talks about doing customer support he says that having smart customers early on is extremely valuable because &#8220;not only will they give you this advice for free, they&#8217;ll pay you&#8221;. I&#8217;ve heard the same kind of thing (or something very close) from <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/blank.html">Steve Blank</a>, <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>, <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a>, <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~wjm/">William Mitchell</a>, and many others. In Graham&#8217;s version I think the fact that it was the founders themselves who were in contact with customers and performing the sales calls is essential. I&#8217;ve experienced the problem where the founders are the technical folks and they bring someone else in to come to do the salescalls after they&#8217;ve worked on a solution in relative isolation. The problem was that the &#8220;expert&#8221; founders refused to believe the feedback brought to them by the salesperson. Because the founders were domain experts and understood the problems and how they should be solved the problem must be that the salesperson &#8220;isn&#8217;t selling the solution the right way&#8221;. Apparently it something that happens pretty commonly, cause I saw a lot of other people bobbing their heads when I first heard Steve Blank describe it. I&#8217;m told the best way (perhaps the only way) to avoid the syndrome is to put the founders out on the front lines. When the experts hear criticism themselves they absorb it, when they hear criticism through an intermediary they doubt the competence of the intermediary. Sounds absurd&#8230; but I think it might be the single best bit of startup related wisdom that I&#8217;ve heard to date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook">Russ</a> and I are going to be <a href="http://106miles.blogspot.com/2005/03/april-106-topic.html">presenting at 106Miles in April</a>. The topic is &#8220;Every Business Needs a Mobile Strategy&#8221;, and as much as possible I would like to encourage discussion on this one. So lets start out beforehand and figure out what topics we want to hit when we get together at the meeting. Russ and I have been running <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.com">Mobile Monday</a> meetings here in the Bay Area, and the response has been simply fantastic. One of the most well respected conferences that I know of, <a href="http://www.demo.com/demofall/">DEMO</a>, merged the mobile and main tracks of their conference because it seems like the two are now inseparable:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the six years of DEMOmobile, wireless technology has advanced the digital lifestyle and become an integral part of most every aspect of computing. That is why, starting this year, DEMOmobile becomes DEMOfall. Join industry leaders during 2 days of ground-breaking presentations, where we&#8217;ll explore wireless innovations in the context of broader technology markets.</p></blockquote>

<p>But still there are <a href="http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/Feb2005/1055.htm">voices shouting caution just as loudly</a>, even from within the industry:</p>

<blockquote><p>The myth of mobile maturity: T-Mobile denounced the notion of maturity, even in voice services. Global mobile users are forecast to double from 1 billion at Cannes last year to 2 billion by end 2005. US customer growth was around 14% last year. (T-Mobile USA customers increased 32%). In European countries, penetration is moving beyond 100%. More important, uses and usage of mobile are immature everywhere, and mobile is just now entering the broadband revolution.</p></blockquote>

<p>At a startup company, risk and uncertainly are constant companions. Conflicting reports of what needs to be done are certainly nothing new, but how can a startup company use this particular situation to best advantage?</p>

<p>As has been learned painfully and repeatedly over the past few years, having a mobile strategy does not mean just figuring out how to slap a WAP or XHTML front end onto whatever your application is. The mobile experience is a <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/2005/01/taking-my-desktop-everywhere-you-can.html">fundamentally different experience than the desktop</a>. One example of the difference is that most people use their mobiles in short bursts during the day, to fill up small chunks of time standing in line or waiting for a train or bus. It&#8217;s a much less immersive experience than sitting down in front of a desktop system for a long stretch of work. Another is that their mobile device is an intensely personal device for many. Their PC might be provided by their employer at the office, or shared by the family at home, but in general their mobile handset is their own. The opportunity to personalize is of much greater interest than many expected, just take a look at the <a href="http://www.textually.org/ringtonia/">thriving ringtone market</a>. I&#8217;m quite the mobile booster normally, but I wouldn&#8217;t have pegged that market as a winner until I saw it happen.</p>

<p>The rules in the area are still being learned, and startup companies are in the position to grow their services in a way that meshes with the new interaction modes instead of simply allowing for them. I would like to know the particular questions that people have about mobility, and where should Russ and I start? Do you want an overview of the technologies (Symbian vs. Palm vs. Brew vs. J2ME)? Delivering an application via WAP/XHTML compared to delivering a native application? Or more of the general overall issues like I described above? The intrinsic differences between mobile and online usage? Different application architectures enabled by mobility (use of asyncronous notifications, location based applications)?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ellementk.com">Elle</a> has been helping out with the <a href="http://workerbeesblog.blogspot.com/2005/03/now-cat-can-really-be-let-out-of-bag.html">Bloghercon effort</a> that <a href="http://workerbeesblog.blogspot.com/">Elisa</a> has bee driving. I wasn&#8217;t sure if they wanted to make info about the effort public yet, but apparently is was announced this past week and <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=bloghercon&amp;sort=date">discussion is underway</a>. They&#8217;re not sure yet if men will be welcome at the session yet, which I admit I don&#8217;t agree with. But I do agree with a lot of the stuff that <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2005/03/blogihericon_co.html">Charlene says</a> about the effort. Although I can come up with a dozen or so women who blog faster than I can say them normally, a lot of the other points in there I agree with. Jessica Baumgart recently <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jkbaumga/2005/03/11#a3227">posted some points as well</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my story about getting noticed from just about a year ago. For about 3 years I was working for a company in Palo Alto doing Linux embedded systems work. We did some pretty hardcore stuff, and I learned a ton in the process. When it was time to move on I felt that I had a really strong set of skills, and that now that I was in Silicon Valley and had learned a ton about working at and with a startup company, that I was ready to strike off on my own and do some consulting for a while. I wanted to get exposed to a whole bunch of new ideas floating around in the environment, and I figured that a boatload of technical ability could just cary me around to all the places I wanted to go. I was wrong, no one came around beating a path to my door to hand over a part of the project they were working on. Eventually, after a whole bunch of painful arguments and me not understanding why no one was paying attention to the things I was saying, Elle eventually showed me what I needed to do to get tied into the environment I needed to be a part of. And amazingly enough it had nothing to do with knowing how to write a plugin for a dynamically typed interpreted language or how to capture snapshots of serial interfaces for debugging. There is a group of people for whom that kind of cred opens doors, but I had &#8220;shifted my audience&#8221; so to speak, and I needed to learn how to talk to them. And all the yelling in the world, no matter how valid it might have been, would have gotten the attention of the people I wanted attention from. It&#8217;s a common mistake apparently, and one that geeks make all the time. I ran headlong into it, I admit it. But it&#8217;s not only a mistake that geeks make, it&#8217;s a problem general  to shifting communities. The techniques and models that work in one area don&#8217;t work in another. Sometimes the right thing to do is to change the way things work, sometimes the right thing to do is adapt personally. Sometimes the right thing lies somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>So my question to the Bloghercon folks would first be are you looking to get noticed by the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/live/top100.html">Technorati 100</a>? Because that&#8217;s going to take a much different strategy than trying to form an alternate network more friendly to the interactions of women within the blogging community. If you&#8217;re looking to change the way that things are done, make sure that you include some of the people making the tools.  The tools in part shape the way you can interact, and part of the reason the link reigns supreme in this environment is because all the tools are made to respect them. It&#8217;s not like you have to <a href="http://mena.typepad.com/about.html">look far</a> for a woman very unfluential in the way that blogging tools are made. If you want some woman to talk about online communities where female participants have enjoyed as much success as the men, the <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/10/11/the_gender_profile_of_wikipedia.html">Wikipedia</a> is a great place to start. I would also personally recommend <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/">Anita Wilhelm</a>, <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a>, and <a href="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/">Betsy Devine</a>. And I would love to attend, if I&#8217;m allowed.</p>
