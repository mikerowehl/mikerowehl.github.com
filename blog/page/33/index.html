  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeremy Zawodny has a <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002277.html">post about RSS scaling problems</a>. Something that came up as a partial solution at one of the blogger meetups was <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mogul-http-delta-10.txt">the HTTP delta proposal</a>. It&#8217;s specifically meant to address this issues:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry.</p></blockquote>

<p>From what I understand there isn&#8217;t an implementation of this proposal out in the wild. It seems like it would have applicability in more and more places however, so maybe it&#8217;s about time. This just addresses the bandwidth efficiency however, which is NOT currently most of the concern. Bandwidth is relatively cheap. There&#8217;s also scalability in terms of computing power required on the server dishing out the RSS. And requiring the server to calculate the differences between the last version that a client has and the current version might eat up more in processing power than it saves in bandwidth. Right now I&#8217;m off into the area of wild speculation however, so don&#8217;t trust what you read here. What I&#8217;m really saying is that here&#8217;s a potential scaling answer. And who knows, if implemented properly on the server side perhaps it could solve both bandwidth and processor cycles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Small Business Trends has three posts that constitute an interview with Tom Ehrenfeld, author of <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/">The Startup Garden</a>:</p>

</ol>


<p>A lot of the comments in there really ring true, especially given <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=321">my thoughts in relation to the recent BlogOn event</a>. BlogOn was a great event mind you, and I would go again if I had the chance, even if just for the interaction with other attendees before, between, and after sessions. But I would have really liked to see more of the kinds of information that comes through in this interview. I particularly liked the answer to question #2 from the first session:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think that the more that individuals can realize how their unique skills and resources and opportunities (themselves or combined with their founding team) can come together in a tangible way that delivers value to customers, the greater their chance of success. I&#8217;m not talking about entrepreneurship as a selfish quest for identity - but the need to pour what you know and care about and are good at into a healthy venture.</p></blockquote>

<p>I would personally love to see an event focused on these kinds of issues. Not really where the next big thing is, but where are we now and what can we do with it? The technologies enable new forms of interaction and new methods of communicating, sure. But now what? What do these new forms mean to the business owner or entrepreneur? In what business directions should we be looking? I think Tom does a great job of laying down a business overview here, and I get the feeling that more directed questioning on any one topic would turn up a wealth of great info. I would love to hear him speak at an event. So there&#8217;s my vote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.blogonevent.com">BlogOn</a> was yesterday, and I&#8217;ve let the issues percolate for a while before trying to write up what I took out of yesterday&#8217;s conference. On the whole there was some interesting discussion, there were definitely interesting people, but I think the conference as a whole was a miss. Why? Cause if you take a look at <a href="http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2004/">the BlogOn website</a>, the subtitle is &#8220;the business of social media&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think there was nearly enough focus on the tranformative power of social media except as related to technology. There were some exceptions, such as the session which talked about <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/blogon/index.cgi?social_media_transforms_corporate_communications">how social media transforms corporate communications</a> (&#8220;press releases used to be something that companies struggled to get journalists to pay attention to, now journalists are seeking out press releases already online so that they can do their research&#8221; - FANTASTIC point!) I liked the sessions in the afternoon more than those in the morning. I went to the business of blogging track, not the company presentation track. Here is were you might say &#8220;Aha! But Mike, if you wanted to hear about companies using social media why didn&#8217;t you go to hear about companies wanting to use social media?&#8221; Well, I took a look at the <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/blogon/index.cgi?company_presentations">wiki page reserved for presenters</a>, and noticed that no one added their link. NOT A SINGLE FUCKING ONE! That says to me that either none of those companies are really serious in their use of social media, or we&#8217;ve completely screwed up our definition of social media. Either way, I didn&#8217;t feel like hearing a bunch of companies pitch when there was at least a chance of hearing about solutions to real issues in social media.</p>

<p>So what was I hoping to hear at the conference? I was hoping for more of a dialogue. I was hoping to talk about the potential usages for these technologies, and not the technologies themselves. I agree with a lot of the <a href="http://tedshelton.blogspot.com/2004/07/lets-reinvent-conferences.html">points that Ted makes about this</a>. What&#8217;s really needed was a deeper delving into particular topics. I was talking to <a href="http://napsterization.org/stories/">Mary</a> about the same issue as well, and she was also saying she had hoped for more depth on particular issues. My take on it is that whenever you have these free ranging overview conversations it always turns into a somewhat religious issue, with everyone throwing in what they think is the most important topic. However, if you give people a particular problem to concentrate on the comments tend to support each other. The free form general commentary tends to diverge at every single switch.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just cause my background is in prototyping, but I do see this as something of a early stage development issue. Although some like to think of blogging as well established, it&#8217;s not. It is not yet &#8220;mainstream&#8221;, despite the fact that there area many from the online community who feel that blogging is already played out. What&#8217;s happened is that we&#8217;re starting to work our way through the evangelists and early adopters and we&#8217;re sitting at the edge of the chasm. I&#8217;m sure you all know which chasm I&#8217;m talking about. And because social software does reverse a lot of previously held tenants, and changes some pretty fundamental power structures, that chasm is both very deep and amazingly wide. But just because all of the cool kids have blogs, are on social networks, and have used wikis that doesn&#8217;t mean that all the work has been done. There is always a shift in getting from the early adopters to the creamy middle. There are very few attempts in progress to move to the other side. The <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=318">stuff that Technorati is doing</a> is one of very few steps in this direction. I was hoping we would talk more about other steps that could be made. What normally happens when a technology goes mainstream is that those evangelists and mavens wander off to do the next cool new thing. And I felt like the conf was following the techies off to the next big thing and not addressing what is needed to keep this current generation of technology moving off toward the rest of the market.</p>

<p>Instead of just bitching, here are a few questions that I think could have been posed that would have gotten everyone pitching in to answer rather than arguing about what is important:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How can a company evaluate the potential usage of (blogs|wikis|social networking software) internally to decrease communication costs?</p></li>
<li><p>How can a company evaluate the potential return from (blogs|wikis|social networking software) externally as a new marketing channel?</p></li>
<li><p>How can a company evaluate the security concern of letting employees blog externally?</p></li>
<li><p>How should a company respond to a highly negative post from an internal blogger</p></li>
<li><p>What can be done to ensure that advertising doesn&#8217;t pollute the value of blogs while still making the authors money?</p></li>
<li><p>What besides advertising can an author use to make money?</p></li>
<li><p>What can be done to make feed technologies (RSS or Atom) more useful as online research tools?</p></li>
<li><p>What can be done to make feed technologies (RSS or Atom) more useful as as news mediums</p></li>
<li><p>What can be done to make feed technologies (RSS or Atom) more useful as an entertainment channel</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Some of the topics discussed laid long these lines, but weren&#8217;t pointed enough to bring about convergent discussion. And I was really hoping that&#8217;s what the &#8220;business&#8221; part of the conference would bring. There&#8217;s enough divergent and speculative discussion at the techie confs already. I was hoping that the conf would give me some of the tools that I need to answer a question from like &#8220;We know there are indirect returns from internal bloggers, but how much? And how can we know if it&#8217;s working or not?&#8221; Because no matter how cool the new technologies are, business is still business, and it&#8217;s still about making money. Even if the avenues to making money this way are completely new, and sometimes at odds with the previous methods of making money, they need to be mapped before others will follow us there. If the new methods are really completely and disruptively new, maybe we even need to invent a new way of mapping before we can hope to start. But we need to do something to help if the rest of the world is going to participate in and benefit from these technologies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first couple of sessions were a bit of a let down actually. There wasn&#8217;t much being talked about that stood outside of the normal questions. I can excuse that however. This is &#8220;the business of social media&#8221;, and it does seem like a much more business focused group than a lot of other conferences. So I can chalk a lot of this up to businesses being focused on what is somewhat known already, and not the really completely witchy edge of trends. This stuff still is pretty much &#8220;out there&#8221;, even if those of us who live online find it old hat. Given that however, I&#8217;m really hoping that we get deeper into the business issues than other events have. I would like to see info about how to make money using social networking, or how to measure savings within a business from hooking people together within an organization using blogs and social networking. We make these nebulous statements like &#8220;hooking together people within an organization gives you better access to your internal information resources.&#8221; Sure. But how much? How can you figure out if a roll out is successful or if it failed? How do you measure &#8220;better connections&#8221; after they happen, let alone estimate them before an implementation? I&#8217;m hoping to see these kinds of issues discussed. I should add them to the wiki.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Weinberger picked up the <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002859.html">post about Technorati providing blog information during the Democratic National Convention</a>. The story has been picked up and spread all over the place by the blogging &#8220;in crowd&#8221;, but I figured I would spread it here also cause it seems like I have more of a mix of social software and mobile readers than hard core bloggers. I&#8217;ve posted about Technorati before, but basically it&#8217;s a service that allows you to figure out who&#8217;s blog is linking to what. There are a few technical reasons behind why their link searching works mostly to find what blogs are linking to, and not web pages in general. But take it on faith that most of the information they have comes from people writing blogs entries with links in them.</p>

<p>At the Democratic National Convention Technorati is going to be feeding into to/through CNN about what the current hot topics are. I&#8217;m assuming this is so that CNN can &#8220;close the feedback loop&#8221;. Meaning that now CNN has another way to find out in realtime the effect of the information they&#8217;ve released. When CNN broadcasts information they don&#8217;t really have a good way to find out what viewers think about the info? The most basic question is, &#8220;do the viewers care at all?&#8221; Technorati is in a great position to answer that question because they can find out what people are linking to, which is an excellent proxy for what a certain group of people are talking about. There are another ways to gather info, like taking phone calls and emails. But because Technorati has a database of what people&#8217;s links point to already, and because computers process the information and not people, Technorati can provide feedback from a much larger group and allow some interesting dissections and regroupings of that data.</p>

<p>The geeks out there might say something like &#8220;but CNN can just check their server logs to see what pages people are looking at. If CNN runs a story they can just check to see how many people hit pages about that story on their site. Why do they need Technorati?&#8221; NO!! This misses completely two major types of info. The first is editorial type posts to a blog. When some bloggers post they provide a link to a story and a whole bunch of commentary. Not everyone clicks through to the originating story. If the post is detailed enough, I bet that number can get very low. Especially when the reader is at a post from a trusted source. There&#8217;s no need to go to the original bit of info, they already have everything they wanted. The second is breaking news. Looking at hot trends as a whole, CNN can pick up on what people are interested in that HASN&#8217;T yet been reported on. I personally think that&#8217;s a really big deal. If CNN is reporting on A, B, and C, but people are talking most about Z, now they can know. This is where the network effects really come in. First you have to look at who&#8217;s linking to you, and then who links to them, and then as an aggregate everything that all of them area linking to as a whole. That&#8217;s where Technorati really breaks out of the box, they enable this view of information in a way that hasn&#8217;t been possible on a large scale before. Great job guys!! I wasn&#8217;t planning to follow the DNC at all, but this news has gotten me interested enough that I&#8217;ll probably tune in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>infogargoyle has a <a href="http://igargoyle.com/archives/000454.html">post about mapmaking</a>, in particular the use of RDF to collaboratively define space. I&#8217;m surprized that a strong open source community hasn&#8217;t already started to form around mapping for mobile devices. Maybe it has and I just don&#8217;t know about it yet? I see projects like <a href="http://www.opengis.org/">OpenGIS</a> and <a href="http://geourl.org">GeoURL</a> (unfortunately down right now, but that&#8217;s not my real point) and I see what seems to be a great set of building blocks. If we could get the basic map down, and from what I heard there were some people lobbying hard to get better map data for the US put in the public domain, a service like GeoURL that gives you local points is a great start. If those points could be filtered by trust of the source, or even beter FOAF type analysis out to some sane degree of connectedness, I think we would have a great app right off the bat. And of course, once you have a good starting point, that&#8217;s when people actually get interested and start filling in their own points of interest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TheFeature has an article, <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100889">Now That Bluetooth Is Alive, It&#8217;s Dead Again</a>, which is a nice even bit of commentary about Bluetooth. I am actually pretty surprised that Bluetooth sales have picked up the way that they have. I&#8217;m a pretty heavy Bluetooth fan I guess. Maybe fan isn&#8217;t the right word. I&#8217;ve worked on some Bluetooth software for Linux, bashed my head against the various problems till I got things working. And there are problems. Even with my relatively recent devices, there were things I had to do to get them working together that it&#8217;s just pure folly to expect an end user to be able to do. I get dizzy when I think about how long ago I first started talking about Bluetooth. Something goes wrong when I&#8217;m fooling with Bluetooth and I think to myself &#8220;hell, it&#8217;s still new, it&#8217;s gonna have glitches.&#8221; But no, it&#8217;s not. I don&#8217;t remember when the first version of the spec was published, but it must have been before 2000 cause I know I was still in New York. If it&#8217;s four years later and there are still major incompatibility problems, something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>However, once things do work together it&#8217;s pretty nice. I can just flip my laptop open and get a GPRS connection without finding a place to put stuff down to line up IR ports, or pull out my PDA to request a map if my cell phone display just isn&#8217;t giving me enough info to make it worthwhile. So I like it a lot, it lets me do what I want to do. But, I&#8217;m not a normal user. I have a PDA and a laptop and a cell phone all with me at the same time. I want to be able to connect via my PDA through my server at home so that I can test out web pages without waiting for GPRS. These are not normal user requirements. So the question comes to mind, what are people using Bluetooth for? Is it headsets? I don&#8217;t see to many of these on my normal rounds of Palo Alto. That doesn&#8217;t mean for sure that they&#8217;re not popular, but normally it&#8217;s a pretty good indicator.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m personally not sure what the end users are doing with Bluetooth, and I would really like to know. I have this sneaking suspicion that they&#8217;re not doing anything yet. When I go to Silicon Valley events that aren&#8217;t directly mobility related sometimes I ask people who have phones that I know support Bluetooth. My informal study turns up about 75% who never really use their Bluetooth. Many who have never even experimented with the function, and don&#8217;t even know what it does. There does seem to be an increase in the number of people who use Bluetooth to sync their phone with their desktop address book, especially among the Apple users. But very few who use their phone to get a data connection from a PDA or laptop. I would like to see these numbers. If anyone has a good pointer to a study for this, please post a comment or trackback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/events/index.php">AlwaysOn conference</a> Tom Byers mentioned the <a href="http://edcorner.stanford.edu/index.shtml">Stanford Technology Ventures Program Educators Corner</a>. The web site has a number of video clips from famous or interesting people in business, talking about the kinds of things they normally talk about at conferences. But you can download them any time and check them out. Nice resource.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a web cast from <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/events/index.php">AlwaysOn</a> today and tomorrow. There&#8217;s also an <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/m2m/index.cgi">event wiki</a> at SocialText. And a few of us have jointed #alwayson on irc.freenode.net instead of using the live chat they have setup.</p>
