  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first couple of sessions were a bit of a let down actually. There wasn&#8217;t much being talked about that stood outside of the normal questions. I can excuse that however. This is &#8220;the business of social media&#8221;, and it does seem like a much more business focused group than a lot of other conferences. So I can chalk a lot of this up to businesses being focused on what is somewhat known already, and not the really completely witchy edge of trends. This stuff still is pretty much &#8220;out there&#8221;, even if those of us who live online find it old hat. Given that however, I&#8217;m really hoping that we get deeper into the business issues than other events have. I would like to see info about how to make money using social networking, or how to measure savings within a business from hooking people together within an organization using blogs and social networking. We make these nebulous statements like &#8220;hooking together people within an organization gives you better access to your internal information resources.&#8221; Sure. But how much? How can you figure out if a roll out is successful or if it failed? How do you measure &#8220;better connections&#8221; after they happen, let alone estimate them before an implementation? I&#8217;m hoping to see these kinds of issues discussed. I should add them to the wiki.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Weinberger picked up the <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002859.html">post about Technorati providing blog information during the Democratic National Convention</a>. The story has been picked up and spread all over the place by the blogging &#8220;in crowd&#8221;, but I figured I would spread it here also cause it seems like I have more of a mix of social software and mobile readers than hard core bloggers. I&#8217;ve posted about Technorati before, but basically it&#8217;s a service that allows you to figure out who&#8217;s blog is linking to what. There are a few technical reasons behind why their link searching works mostly to find what blogs are linking to, and not web pages in general. But take it on faith that most of the information they have comes from people writing blogs entries with links in them.</p>

<p>At the Democratic National Convention Technorati is going to be feeding into to/through CNN about what the current hot topics are. I&#8217;m assuming this is so that CNN can &#8220;close the feedback loop&#8221;. Meaning that now CNN has another way to find out in realtime the effect of the information they&#8217;ve released. When CNN broadcasts information they don&#8217;t really have a good way to find out what viewers think about the info? The most basic question is, &#8220;do the viewers care at all?&#8221; Technorati is in a great position to answer that question because they can find out what people are linking to, which is an excellent proxy for what a certain group of people are talking about. There are another ways to gather info, like taking phone calls and emails. But because Technorati has a database of what people&#8217;s links point to already, and because computers process the information and not people, Technorati can provide feedback from a much larger group and allow some interesting dissections and regroupings of that data.</p>

<p>The geeks out there might say something like &#8220;but CNN can just check their server logs to see what pages people are looking at. If CNN runs a story they can just check to see how many people hit pages about that story on their site. Why do they need Technorati?&#8221; NO!! This misses completely two major types of info. The first is editorial type posts to a blog. When some bloggers post they provide a link to a story and a whole bunch of commentary. Not everyone clicks through to the originating story. If the post is detailed enough, I bet that number can get very low. Especially when the reader is at a post from a trusted source. There&#8217;s no need to go to the original bit of info, they already have everything they wanted. The second is breaking news. Looking at hot trends as a whole, CNN can pick up on what people are interested in that HASN&#8217;T yet been reported on. I personally think that&#8217;s a really big deal. If CNN is reporting on A, B, and C, but people are talking most about Z, now they can know. This is where the network effects really come in. First you have to look at who&#8217;s linking to you, and then who links to them, and then as an aggregate everything that all of them area linking to as a whole. That&#8217;s where Technorati really breaks out of the box, they enable this view of information in a way that hasn&#8217;t been possible on a large scale before. Great job guys!! I wasn&#8217;t planning to follow the DNC at all, but this news has gotten me interested enough that I&#8217;ll probably tune in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>infogargoyle has a <a href="http://igargoyle.com/archives/000454.html">post about mapmaking</a>, in particular the use of RDF to collaboratively define space. I&#8217;m surprized that a strong open source community hasn&#8217;t already started to form around mapping for mobile devices. Maybe it has and I just don&#8217;t know about it yet? I see projects like <a href="http://www.opengis.org/">OpenGIS</a> and <a href="http://geourl.org">GeoURL</a> (unfortunately down right now, but that&#8217;s not my real point) and I see what seems to be a great set of building blocks. If we could get the basic map down, and from what I heard there were some people lobbying hard to get better map data for the US put in the public domain, a service like GeoURL that gives you local points is a great start. If those points could be filtered by trust of the source, or even beter FOAF type analysis out to some sane degree of connectedness, I think we would have a great app right off the bat. And of course, once you have a good starting point, that&#8217;s when people actually get interested and start filling in their own points of interest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TheFeature has an article, <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100889">Now That Bluetooth Is Alive, It&#8217;s Dead Again</a>, which is a nice even bit of commentary about Bluetooth. I am actually pretty surprised that Bluetooth sales have picked up the way that they have. I&#8217;m a pretty heavy Bluetooth fan I guess. Maybe fan isn&#8217;t the right word. I&#8217;ve worked on some Bluetooth software for Linux, bashed my head against the various problems till I got things working. And there are problems. Even with my relatively recent devices, there were things I had to do to get them working together that it&#8217;s just pure folly to expect an end user to be able to do. I get dizzy when I think about how long ago I first started talking about Bluetooth. Something goes wrong when I&#8217;m fooling with Bluetooth and I think to myself &#8220;hell, it&#8217;s still new, it&#8217;s gonna have glitches.&#8221; But no, it&#8217;s not. I don&#8217;t remember when the first version of the spec was published, but it must have been before 2000 cause I know I was still in New York. If it&#8217;s four years later and there are still major incompatibility problems, something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>However, once things do work together it&#8217;s pretty nice. I can just flip my laptop open and get a GPRS connection without finding a place to put stuff down to line up IR ports, or pull out my PDA to request a map if my cell phone display just isn&#8217;t giving me enough info to make it worthwhile. So I like it a lot, it lets me do what I want to do. But, I&#8217;m not a normal user. I have a PDA and a laptop and a cell phone all with me at the same time. I want to be able to connect via my PDA through my server at home so that I can test out web pages without waiting for GPRS. These are not normal user requirements. So the question comes to mind, what are people using Bluetooth for? Is it headsets? I don&#8217;t see to many of these on my normal rounds of Palo Alto. That doesn&#8217;t mean for sure that they&#8217;re not popular, but normally it&#8217;s a pretty good indicator.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m personally not sure what the end users are doing with Bluetooth, and I would really like to know. I have this sneaking suspicion that they&#8217;re not doing anything yet. When I go to Silicon Valley events that aren&#8217;t directly mobility related sometimes I ask people who have phones that I know support Bluetooth. My informal study turns up about 75% who never really use their Bluetooth. Many who have never even experimented with the function, and don&#8217;t even know what it does. There does seem to be an increase in the number of people who use Bluetooth to sync their phone with their desktop address book, especially among the Apple users. But very few who use their phone to get a data connection from a PDA or laptop. I would like to see these numbers. If anyone has a good pointer to a study for this, please post a comment or trackback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mohamed Salem mailed me to say that his article <a href="http://www.eedesign.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=22103383">An introduction to open-source hardware development</a> was published in EEDesign. Congratulations Mohamed and Jamil!! He mailed me a copy while he was still working on it, and I&#8217;ve been anxiously awaiting the publication so that I pontificate on the subject without trying to lay down some technical details I don&#8217;t know (not that it usually stops me). I have no practical hardware design experience at all. I normally get the stuff after someone else has put it together and now they want it to do something.</p>

<p>Even so, there are some general issues at work here I would like to talk about. The most basic being that it seems like just about everything is becoming software. Desktop tools are software, simulators are software, industrial control systems, payment processing is software, advertising is software, workflow is software. Now, apparently, hardware can be software as well. I&#8217;m not saying that all these functions have been completely replaces with software, but these functions have been trending more and more toward software. The reason often given is that software is relatively easy to change compared to the dedicated function systems and processes that it replaces. Which is kind of funny, considering that the general opinion is also that computer programming is still rather underdeveloped as an engineering field. Or maybe it&#8217;s scary. I&#8217;m not sure which yet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorta fence-sitting on the issue of the general adoption of open source practices by the hardware community in general. I think it would be a great thing. But I think there are a whole different set of dynamics involved in order for it to hit critical mass. One of the reasons that open source hit the ramp was because there were lots of very cheap computers around for people to play with, and the base tools needed were all ready for people to start hacking with those systems right away. Thank you <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Stallman</a>. Thank you <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Tanenbaum</a>. Thank you <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/linus/">Torvalds</a>. The same thing isn&#8217;t really true within the hardware community. Not yet at least, although some people are doing some <a href="http://www.opencollector.org/">great work</a> to try to get there.</p>

<p>Lets suppose that this does happen. Most devices include FPGAs or some like technology. Hardware-as-service is a reality. <a href="http://www.sdrforum.org/">Software defined radio</a> enables your cellphone/pda/laptop to talk to the cellular network, Wifi network, bluetooth devices, wideband home area network, extremely low frequency interplanetary CIA network, whatever you want. What happens then? I can&#8217;t even begin to speculate about the business end of that. I imagine that most hardware manufacturers wouldn&#8217;t be too happy about it. They would be reduced to either very high end systems or selling commoditized hardware substrate.</p>

<p>The concept of shuffling around processing locations by moving around hardware cores in addition to algorithms is interesting, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a compelling reason to move in this direction. I remember the first time I ran across RPC and the promise that it would make scalable processing power available at a low cost. And then the same thing from Java and RMI, and CORBA, and PVM and parallel computing languages, grid computing, web services. I&#8217;ll believe that one when we see it. The limiting factor there doesn&#8217;t seem to be the power of the underlying protocols and scope of the standards, it seems to be our ability to combine them into a meaningful and flexible system.</p>

<p>I do think it could have a pretty drastic effect on the technology adoption curve in general however. Because people wouldn&#8217;t have to buy hardware as often? Kinda. Because it&#8217;s easier to experiment with? Sorta. I think it would change things because it would allow hardware as well as software to propagate in a decentralized fashion. Part of the continued problem with hardware is that it needs to be &#8220;top down&#8221;. This is not the way that software needs to work any more. Take Napster as one example. No one needed to cut deals with distributors and develop sales channels. No one needed to develop a full business plan and secure funding. All that was needed was a good idea and a working set of code. Same thing with Linux. Same thing, to a degree, with GMail. Internet distribution is a major enabler of disruptive change, which is good for innovation and bad for entrenched players. Unfortunately hardware is still tied to the same mechanisms that it relied on to get minicomputers out into a market dominated by mainframes. Which means generally arrogance, luck, and as many fresh college graduates as you can lay your hands on.</p>

<p>Of course, if those kookie new ideas can bundle new hardware designs along with their new software I think we&#8217;re headed for something interesting. Then again, I thought we were headed for something interesting when bluetooth promised to connect all my different devices seamlessly. It&#8217;s not enough to change the world on it&#8217;s own, but it&#8217;s certainly a great enabling factor.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just finished up the <a href="http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/07/revised-schedule-for-saturday-meet-up.html">pre-forum forum meeting of the Bay Area Mobility Forum (BAMF)</a>. I hung around to drink more cause, well, I have a GPRS connection and it&#8217;s nice out :-) The meeting was actually really good. What we&#8217;ve decided to do is have a few relatively low-key events. One a month, for three or four months. Each time we&#8217;ll have a main topic, but have an &#8220;open mic&#8221; time when anyone who attends can harangue the audience about pretty much whatever they want (time limit in effect of course). The hope is that over the course of a couple of months we&#8217;ll manage to build up a bit of an audience, &#8220;build up critical mass&#8221; so to speak. And at that point we&#8217;ll plan for an event which has a format more like a standard conference. Multiple sessions on a number of topics. It was universally felt that we would like to bring together people from all the different part of the equation (technical, business, developers, manufacturers, standards organizations, carriers, end-users, etc) and provide a way for them to interact. But first we need to build up a group, which is best done in a more intimate setting than a conference normally affords. All in all, a very hopeful meeting. My sincere thanks to Ted, Erik, Spencer, and Russ for coming out to set down an outline for what I hope will grow to be a great community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a bunch about what makes people contribute to shared online systems. I mean both public systems like wikis or shared blogs, and private systems like a corporate mailing list or intranet site. <a href="http://www.communitywiki.org">CommunityWiki</a> has lots of great information about this topic in general. There are a bunch of issues with long standing projects that seem to be pretty difficult to tackle. How do new members get acquainted and start contributing without demanding too much of their time for startup? With some open online projects, you actually want this &#8220;barrier to entry&#8221; for new members. You want them to self select by requiring that they dedicate some time to at least understand the norms and conventions. If they don&#8217;t understand the norms they are easier to ignore. So this is one of the potential filters, keeping out people who aren&#8217;t genuinely interested in the topic by way of making them easy to spot and ignore.</p>

<p>But what if you aren&#8217;t running an open project? What if the system you&#8217;re setting up is meant to be used within a corporation. Normally you want to remove that barrier to entry. You just want to get everyone up and running quickly, and rely on everyones membership in the same organization to to ensure that they aren&#8217;t there to just be disruptive. If you end up with everyone working together without them going through an acclimation procedure things tend to devolve into chaos more quickly. The joining procedure for newbies serves to provide the set of spontaneous process.</p>

<p>The answer would seem to be to provide process for the corporate version. But what that ends up doing is designating a smaller group who are then perceived to own the wiki. The other members tend to be less involved, less creative, and more resistant to the process. What we would like is an evolved shared process for the corporate case. But providing a mechanism for that when you want everyone assigned to contribute can&#8217;t involve much forced overhead. People will just get frusterated and walk away.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that designating a central manager (or management group) is the only way to do it. There must be some other way to get people working together when they have a shared goal.</p>
