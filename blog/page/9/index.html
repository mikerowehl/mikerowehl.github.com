  <div class="entry-content"><p>Slashdot has a <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/16/182232&amp;from=rss">post pointing to a ZDnet article comparing number of published expoits between Internet Explorer and Firefox</a>. Numbers like this don&#8217;t really mean anything though. Comparing the number of PUBLISHED expoits found in an open source project to those found in a like proptietary project is like comparing the number of bullseyes you can throw in darts without and with a blindfold on. I would actually expect the Firefox numbers to be an order of magnatude higher than IE, given the amount of time that&#8217;s been poured into IE so far. Sure, Firefox builds on a common codebase that spans back over a long period, but the number of users that the recent versions have seen is much lower. Over time the Firefox browser will evolve much more quickly, receive much more testing as the userbase grows, and end up much more hardened in the long run. The honeymoon has just started.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a spam comment <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=453">to this post</a> that I just had to approve so that everyone could see it. I have no idea what to make of it. It&#8217;s either funny, or sad, or scary&#8230;. Maybe all three. Is the person really tired of their job and just fooling around?  Is this the spammer equivalent of watching <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html">Strongbad</a> while at work? Or is it an attempt to make the spam appear more valid?  The link to a Yahoo profile is a nice touch. It provides a redirection for the links, the same way that the spam blogs on Blogger do. And it provides these traits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Age: 26</p></li>
<li><p>Marital Status: Single</p></li>
<li><p>Sex: Female</p></li>
<li><p>Occupation: Free as bird</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Pretty much ensuring that the bored geeks trawling through the Yahoo profiles will click on it. If it were me I would include a stock image of some random cute girl just so that the link in the list of profiles will appear with the little camera icon next to it. But otherwise it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russ pasted a link <a href="http://tonermishap.blogspot.com/2005/09/simpsons-with-audio-description.html">t o a description of watching The Simpsons with audio descriptions on</a>. I really really wish those videos were retrievable right now. Apparently the person who uploaded them ran out of bandwidth. If someone can get a hold of them and create some torrents that would rock. The descriptions are hysterical and I bet actually watching the videos would have me rolling around on the floor.</p>

<blockquote><p>I began to wonder why the narrator seemed so interested in talking about the Alec Baldwin-voiced character so much; in this bit, he discusses his muscles and his Speedo bathing suit.</p></blockquote>

<p>For some reason the fact that this stuff comes in with the broadcast, combined with not many people knowing it&#8217;s there and that the effect was combined with one of my favorite shows is just really satisfying. Like some secret little hidden nugget that someone just discovered already existing in millions of cable TVs all over the country. And then I&#8217;m left wondering what the audio commentary to something like Aqua Teen Hunger Force or Family Guy would be like.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/43677366_4bd96b30f5_o_d.jpg" alt="Mountain Dew Pitch Black II" /></p>

<p>I think he has a bright future. I figured it had more caffeine than regular Dew, but <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/pepsi_brands/ingredient_facts/index.php">that doesn&#8217;t appear to be the case</a>. 36mg each. Check out that MDX though, 47. I need a source for that junk. I would probably have to go to some seedy neighborhood and buy it from a guy in a broken down Impalla. I think I would do it though.</p>

<p>Seriously, this stuff is pretty good. I drink a decent amount of Mountain Dew, and the little twist they put on PBII meets with my approval. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend picking up a few cases without sampling it first. But that&#8217;s what we did and it turned out okay.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1754&amp;mo=9&amp;yr=2005">first meeting of the Search SIG from SDForum</a> was last night. The new forum is run by <a href="http://www.500hats.com/sys-tmpl/door/">Dave McClure</a> and <a href="http://blog.softtechvc.com/">Jeff Clavier</a>. They did a great job on this first event, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to our combined Search SIG and Mobile Monday event happening next month. I only seen <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2005/09/search-sig-yahoo.html">one posting so far</a>. After <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall</a> and <a href="http://feedblog.org/">Kevin</a> vying for attention during the announcements, I figured they would represent with a summary or something.  Here&#8217;s mine.</p>

<p>The main section of the presentation was a panel lead by Doug Kaye from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/index.html">IT Conversations</a>. Doug started out pretty early drawing a distinction between different kinds of audio search, with the main distinction being between directories of audio and search services that actually look at the audio and try to index it. <a href="http://www.podscope.com/">Podscope</a> and <a href="http://www.blinkx.com/overview.php">Blinkx</a> were mentioned in particular. Podscope is used frequently by companies looking for mentions of their name or products. There was one other mentioned, but I must have gotten the name wrong. If someone knows it please leave me a comment, I&#8217;ll update the post. Jeff from Yahoo drew a distinction between phonetic search and text recovery search. Making a transcript from audio gives you text that you can search, but frequently gives garbage back if the audio quality is poor or there&#8217;s a lot of noise. Phonetic search tends to give better results, but doesn&#8217;t give you text to work with. He also pointed out that closed captioning is another fantastic source of info if you&#8217;re dealing with media where that&#8217;s available. Someone joked that closed captioning tends to be highly innacurate, but apparently there&#8217;s a mandate (FCC?) that requires some minimal degree of accuracy (97%?) for closed captioning on TV broadcasts.</p>

<p>Eric Rice from <a href="http://www.audioblog.com">Audioblog.com</a> (recently funded) made that point that most podcasts appear with some kind of text, and getting that text indexed is the key to getting your content found. He said he personally hasn&#8217;t had trouble getting his content found. He likes tagging, even though it has a way to go to be a mature technique. In his opinion extracting text from audio isn&#8217;t a great technique, you lose lots of nuance like sarcasm. When asked about directories he said that as a publisher he doesn&#8217;t like that there are so many directories to deal with. ITunes is really the big kid on the block when you think about directories. The inclusion of podcasts in the ITunes setup doubled traffic for lots of folks. Eric also gets people coming into his site from searches that hit his show notes. He also tends to tag his own stuff on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> to bootstrap it.</p>

<p>David Marks from <a href="http://www.loomia.com/">Loomia</a> spoke about the different kinds of things that are searched for. Enterprises search for mentions of their name, but people tend to search for things like music. Conversion to text just isn&#8217;t going to help at all when it comes to something like finding music. Loomia attempts to do that through recommendation and collaborative filtering. It helps you to find the things you didn&#8217;t know to search for. Timeliness is very important with blogs, but it hasn&#8217;t hit yet with audio. It will hit with audio, and that should be very interesting. Audio search is very much unlike traditional search because the cost of scanning results is much higher. It&#8217;s not like a page you can scan with excerpts randomly clicking through to see which is the right one. Starting up an audio stream and checking to see if it fits your needs is a much more cumbersome activity.</p>

<p>There was some talk about <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss">Media RSS</a>, extensions to RSS spearheaded by Yahoo. Media RSS aims to provide additional information about rich media to be transported along with RSS feeds. It&#8217;s meant to help democratize the creation of rich media, but currently people have to be pretty techy to use it. Eric said there was really a need for vendors to create tools that emit this kind of extra information with a single click of a button or toggle of a checkbox. It&#8217;s what they did with Audioblog for the ITunes extensions. There&#8217;s a very simple checkbox that allows people to include the extended attributes in the information that Audioblog emits for them. Normal people can&#8217;t and don&#8217;t want to edit RSS. Dave from Loomia said that as an aggregator you really have to eat garbage and poo gold. You have to take in all kinds of errors that the user makes in putting up their info, and provide perfectly correct information to your consumers. It would be great if people validated their feeds, but they don&#8217;t. And it would be dumb to expect them to. It would be great though. Character set problems are very common. Doug said he&#8217;s run into a lot of character set issues as well.</p>

<p>There was some discussion about the ITunes release that doubled traffic. It happened right around the beginning of July. Apple didn&#8217;t tell anyone what was going on though. They sucked in the wrong feeds, and none of the podcasters knew about the ITunes extensions cause they weren&#8217;t public at that point. As a result the podcast info in the ITunes directory looked like crap. But most people forgave it cause it doubled their traffic.</p>

<p>Ev (from <a href="http://www.odeo.com/">Odeo</a>) made a point about the key to getting found having nothing to do with technology, it&#8217;s all about being unique and having interesting things to say. If you do that people will find their way to what you post. He also said that Odeo isn&#8217;t really looking at the creation of text to go along with the audio they do. Most current podcasters think of their website/blog as the home of their audio, but Odeo really wants to go after the very non-technical users who don&#8217;t have a site to associate with. They just want audio.</p>

<p>Eric mentioned that mobile devices also don&#8217;t really encourage the use of text. Blogging behavior really doesn&#8217;t apply when most of the consumption of the audio is being done on iPods and other audio players. People aren&#8217;t going to link or trackback from their iPod. Eric said that everything that Audioblog does for audio, they do for video as well. He&#8217;s a big believer in video. Ev said that he wasn&#8217;t as enthusiastic about it however, cause the consumption devices aren&#8217;t as widespread. There are portable audio players all over the place, but no so for video. Doug also made the point that audio already dominates drive time and exercise time, there&#8217;s an existing consumption model for audio.</p>

<p>Then there was a quick break and there were demos from Loomia, Odeo, and Audioblog. Great demos actually, I really liked this part of the session. I liked the part about the consumption model for audio vs. video. What podcasting allows people to do is pour more interesting content into the time when they&#8217;re driving or exercising. Definitely makes a lot of sense. But the same thing is true for video. There is a built in consumption model there. Lots of people sit around in the evening and channel or tivo surf for an hour or two after dinner or before bed. Would the same thing apply if we were able to pour content from online into that space. Of course, it would have to come in to something that would allow it to be displayed in the same way, it would have to appear on your television and not your computer screen. That might not be true in Asia however, where usage of mobile devices is already pretty well positioned for something like video delivery. There has been some effort already to provide this kind of service, I think specificly about both <a href="http://www.akimbo.com/">Akimbo</a> and <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/09/newsweek_netfli.html">some efforts by Tivo</a> when I say this, but I don&#8217;t think anyone has really crossed the line into videocasting like this. Can I subscribe to a Media RSS feed if I get an Akimbo box?</p>

<p>I think someone like <a href="http://www.mobitv.com/">MobiTV</a> would be pretty well served by thinking about stuff like this. Mobile video makes sense, but only if there are clips and snippets of the right size worth watching. Clips and snippets of the right size are generally just about movie trailer or commercial length (I know some folks really think the ideal video length for mobile consumption is 4 to 5 minutes, but I disagree). People generally aren&#8217;t going to pay for those little videos however. Do I want to pay $3 to $10 to watch a few minutes of video on my phone? Hell no. So you need a different way to make money off that content. How about putting commercials in? No, when the slices of time you have to fill are short already no one wants to wait for commercials to go along with their content. So how about making the whole video clip a commercial? &#8220;What the hell are you talking about?&#8221; you might say. How about if the video clips that MobiTV carried were basically just coming attractions and short versions of longer content?  If I download a clip via MobiTV, for free, and I like what I just saw I can opt to use my IP DRV at home to download the main content (a new movie, a television show, whatever). Television already runs cross promotion on television in order to get folks to change the channel to whatever it is they&#8217;re pimping. How about paying to pimp it on mobiles as well. If the content were done right I think people might actually enjoy the bits they get on their mobile, and because they get it for free they&#8217;ll be a lot happier with what they do get. It would basicly be using your mobile as a video remote control for your DVR at home. You can whip it out when you have a few minutes free and check out recomendations and new additions instead of doing that part with the remote control while sitting on the couch. When you select stuff you want it activates the box at home that starts downloading. And by the time you park your ass in front of the tube you have a hot steaming dose of fresh video cache to stimulate and amuse and rock you to sleep. Sounds like a good idea to me at least.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was going to post earlier, but <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-09-12-voa60.cfm">apparently a lot of Los Angeles was without power today</a> and my hosting provider was in an affected area. I realized my mail client was complaining about dropped connections, so I checked and my site was down, so then I went to file a trouble ticket and realized their site was down, so then I went to the offsite status page and found a link to that story. When I saw the reference to al-Qaida in the story I joked to a co-worker that one should never attribute to malice that which can as easily be explained by incompetence. Looks like I was right: &#8220;It began after workers installing system upgrades incorrectly cut several cables and stretched from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific coast and north into the San Fernando Valley. Neighboring cities connected to the LADWP&#8217;s power supply also were affected.&#8221; (via <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/12628595.htm">Mercury News</a>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a problem with the X32 running Linux 2.6.13 where the audio device was there, but I couldn&#8217;t always hear the output.  I found <a href="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0502.2/0755.html">this post mentioning that the headphone sensor and line jack sensor both need to be muted</a>, which worked for me. Here&#8217;s the card info from the model I have:</p>

<p>`miker@spark:~$ cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [I82801DBICH4   ]: ICH4 - Intel 82801DB-ICH4</p>

<pre><code>                 Intel 82801DB-ICH4 with AD1981B at 0xc0000c00, irq 11
</code></pre>

<p>miker@spark:~$`</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the alsa driver snd_intel8x0 and made the change using the alsamixer curses tool (although apparently you can turn on the sensor switches for the volume panel control under Gnome as well).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I see stories like <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/03/2011200&amp;from=rss">this one about 4G cell phone services being worked on with gigabit data rates</a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/04/1410253&amp;from=rss">this one with doubts about consumers really wanting digital homes</a> and overall I&#8217;m left wondering about the ability of the market to deliver innovation. Would I like gigabit data rates to my phone? Of course, why not? Would I be willing to pay the equivalently scaled up cost of $200K per month in order to do so ($20 per month for 100Kbps being vaguely equivalent to $200,000 per month for 1,000,000Kbps or 1Gbps)? No, of course I wouldn&#8217;t. In many ways the technical achievement in these fields has outstripped the ability of markets and products to deliver them to end users. Innovation is good, seemingly unrelated discoveries sometimes lead to fantastic breakthroughs, and the only way to get that to happen is to let the passionate people keep hacking away on the things they love. But there&#8217;s also a very real sense of doubt when I hear about this stuff. I was supposed to have gigabit wired connections available at home. It was supposed to give me instant access to all the world media at the click of a button. I think it would be fair to say that vision was unrealistic. So when I hear that I could get gigabit to my handset soon I can&#8217;t help but think &#8220;Wow, I would like to just consistently get my 100Kbps all the way from Palo Alto to San Francisco on the train without constant service drops.&#8221; And think sarcasticly that the real driver for the enhanced data rate is that telcos think their profits will scale with the data rate because now people can download more ringtones. When in reality if they want to sell more ringtones the limiting factor has nothing to do with bandwidth. It has to do with user interface and cost and customer awareness and compelling product. I would guess that bandwidth is somewhere down around 20th in terms of contributing factors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just saw a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/?p=207">post over at Techcrunch</a> about <a href="http://solosub.com/">SoloSub</a>, a service to allow subscription via multiple mechanisms but using a single button and link. I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=388">posted an example</a> of something that was much the same at the beginning of the year.  Feedback was a pretty mixed bag, with people giving all sorts of reasons for and against it. The main takeaway though is that I should have just put the thing up and gotten it ready. Cause despite all the reasons against doing it, feed subscription still sucks. Some people just like to talk and talk and talk and tell you why it&#8217;s a bad idea to do whatever it is that you&#8217;re about to do. Screw that. I say good luck SoloSub, making RSS subing easier is a great goal and I hope you can make it happen. I&#8217;ve added a button here (down at the bottom, but it&#8217;s down there :-)</p>
