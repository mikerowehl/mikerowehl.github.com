  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just saw a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/?p=207">post over at Techcrunch</a> about <a href="http://solosub.com/">SoloSub</a>, a service to allow subscription via multiple mechanisms but using a single button and link. I <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=388">posted an example</a> of something that was much the same at the beginning of the year.  Feedback was a pretty mixed bag, with people giving all sorts of reasons for and against it. The main takeaway though is that I should have just put the thing up and gotten it ready. Cause despite all the reasons against doing it, feed subscription still sucks. Some people just like to talk and talk and talk and tell you why it&#8217;s a bad idea to do whatever it is that you&#8217;re about to do. Screw that. I say good luck SoloSub, making RSS subing easier is a great goal and I hope you can make it happen. I&#8217;ve added a button here (down at the bottom, but it&#8217;s down there :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I keep hearing people talking about Flash as an open platform, but every time I&#8217;m faced with Flash on a website even Firefox takes me to a download for a binary component from Macromedia with no source available. Definitely there are tons of interesting open source tools out there, like Ming and OpenLaszlo, but I&#8217;ve been holding off cause there&#8217;s no open runtime. There&#8217;s work going on in the mobile end too, but the flash player there is definitely closed source. In my opinion the platform isn&#8217;t open until it&#8217;s end to end open, open source development tools emitting publicly speced formats and languages being executed through an open runtime. I&#8217;m not a Java fan for precisely this reason, no open source runtime. So did I miss the open source Flash runtime somewhere?  I know very little about Flash and associated systems, so maybe I&#8217;m just not looking for the right terms in my Google searches. Is there something that I can download in source form and compile and install on my Linux laptop that&#8217;ll work with Firefox that&#8217;ll allow me to see sites like <a href="http://www.interspot.com">Interspot</a>?</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://www.russellbeatti.com/notebook/">Russ</a> pointed me to the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/communitysource/hotspot/download.xml">community licensed Hotspot virtual machine for Java</a>, which is a JVM with source code available.  I was pretty surprized to find that out, cause I spent a lot of time digging around for the Blackdown code a while ago, and repeated questions always got me the answer that it wasn&#8217;t available. Now I&#8217;m told that the JVM source code has always been available from Sun&#8230; not what I remember however. Either way, at least there&#8217;s a JVM to download and take a look at if you find Java behaving badly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unfortunately sometimes I have to access sites using a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps2308/index.html">Cisco VPN</a>. Today I&#8217;m at the tail end of setting up my new laptop, so I figured I would go see if there&#8217;s updates to the VPN software for Linux. I find I need to register in order to download the client software. Annoying, but not crippling. I fill out the form, and another form (which I actually fill out three times before I figure out that I NEED to give them my work address, despite what seems to be a &#8220;choice&#8221; in their interface), and another form, and then the final form, get the email, click the link, get presented with a login prompt. Then it says &#8220;Cisco has determined that Cisco.com password protection has been compromised&#8221;. Wow, that was quick. I just signed up, what&#8217;s the deal with that? So I email the account they tell me to, get a random password, login again&#8230; same error screen. I&#8217;m not that bright, but I recognize an infinite loop when I see one. It&#8217;s crap like this that gets me up and <a href="http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/">evaluating</a> <a href="http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/">alternatives</a>. Come on, you don&#8217;t even have to convince me to use your stuff, unfortunately someone already decided to. All you have to do is not piss me off as I continue to use it, and you keep a customer for your firewall + VPN product. You have switching cost on your side, you&#8217;re in a position of advantage. Put the damn software up in a public download area, you&#8217;re not charging for it anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I installed 2.6.13 on my Thinkpad today (it&#8217;s magically changed from an R51 to an X32, you&#8217;re not gonna hear me complain). I figured I would follow up on my <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=550">initial WPA Linux post</a> and mention that the Wireless Extensions version 18 are included now, and the ipw2200 driver uses the wireless extensions instead of custom ioctl()s now. Net effect: compile wpa_supplicant with CONFIG_DRIVER_WEXT=y in the .config file, and run wpa_supplicant with -D wext to use the wireless extensions when wpa_supplicant is running. If you don&#8217;t you get an errors something like &#8220;ioctl[IPW_IOCTL_WPA_SUPPLICANT]: Operation not supported&#8221; when you run wpa_supplicant. The support seems to be a little rough on this new laptop, it takes a few tries sometimes to attach to the access point, and for some reason I can&#8217;t get DHCP replies. Though if I keep trying till it connects and then setup the interface by hand it works. I&#8217;ll have to dig into it at some other point and see what&#8217;s going wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I need to echo some of the stuff that <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008608.html">Russ says about New Orleans</a> and <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/09/02.html#a1294">Jon Udell as well about the wireless infrastructure</a>. Some stuff, not all of it. I actually don&#8217;t much care about New Orleans. I was there before it flooded and got to see it. Great place, too bad it&#8217;s underwater. I&#8217;m not saying that people shouldn&#8217;t live there, but if you live there you&#8217;re taking certain risks. And when those risks becomes reality it&#8217;s your problem. HOWEVER, I do feel that my taxes have paid for a certain degree of &#8220;disaster preparredness&#8221;. The folks on the teevee keep telling me that. Our nation is apparently prepared for anything. Which is why I&#8217;m kinda concerned that it was caught offgaurd by a storm system. They&#8217;re usually not easy to miss. They don&#8217;t even sneak really. They just kinda roll up and do their thing. So what is it exactly that we didn&#8217;t expect? And why is it that we can&#8217;t deal with it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not gonna donate, I&#8217;ve already given enough. And about this &#8220;Think about yourself being in this same situation and donate&#8221;. No way, total lunacy. People are dying in the streets, attempts to prepare and dumping in huge amounts of money did shit, current tactics being proposed are point solutions lending no real stability and probably decreasing our capability long term. And I&#8217;m supposed to donate? How about I just set the money on fire instead and hope the ashes soak up enough water to help them out? So here&#8217;s my advice: Think about yourself being in the same situation and buy a shotgun. Learn how to use it. And &#8220;be prepared&#8221; to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s some stuff I&#8217;ve been either working with or reading up on lately, cool stuff that I&#8217;ve heard about in passing but isn&#8217;t in general usage yet:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://wiki.hping.org/">hping</a> - network packet generator, more like a network script adaptor. It provides low level packet generation functions to a TCL interpreter. Hping always gets mentioned at DefCon, and I say &#8220;Wow, I should check that out&#8221;, and then promptly forget. I was just wishing it had a python interface instead&#8230;.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">scapy</a> - which is a Python interface to the same low level kinds of packet manipulation. Yum. Time to install Linux on an Ipaq with 802.11 support and go cause some mayhem.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/softflowd/">softflowd</a> - captures network traffic and provides aggregate statistics. MTRG is cool, but the second question is always &#8220;so what&#8217;s causing that spike&#8221;, and I&#8217;m hoping this can help out with that. Check out this <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2005/08/18/Big_Scary_Daemons.html?page=1">ONLamp article about netflows</a>. Another one I&#8217;ve heard about but never tried.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s kinda a slow news day overall. Maybe everyone is all wrapped up in this whole city underwater thing. Not my style. So instead I&#8217;m catching up a bit on the geekier side of the reading I have sitting untouched in my aggie. Posts from LTU are always good for some geekin, and <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/941">the post about Context Oriented Programming</a> in particular caught my attention. I started reading the paper, and right about the end of the first page had a pretty decent mental image of what was up so I stopped. Nice idea. And then there&#8217;s the comment in LTU saying that it sounds like AOP (that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/01/14/aop.html">Aspect Oriented Programming</a> for those of you who don&#8217;t have the kind of m4d cred that me and my dawg <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/user/view/1">Ehud Lamm</a> do). Sure does. Not hard to figure out, AOP is listed as related work at the end of the paper. Also not that it means anything of course. You can write object oriented programs in imperitive languages and declarative programs in functional languages and do all sorts of nutty stuff in C. It all comes down to what stuff the tools make it easy to do. Is the context oriented model new? No, probably not. Sounds exactly like the kind of abstraction that exists in protocol design. However bringing the model up to the level of the implementation of classes, and making the basic level of granularity for the programmer activation and deactivation of layers of functionality is somewhat interesting. Reminds me of the move to get busses abstracted in the Linux kernel. There was a proliferation of devices at one point, and suddenly a device that used to exist as PCI now all of a sudden had a PCMCIA version and a USB version. So the busses were made &#8220;objects&#8221; in their own right so that the actual device code could be factored out from the bus manipulation code. If you take the view from the kernel end the bus is delegating to individual device objects, but if you take a look at the system overall it&#8217;s very close to context oriented composition of the device model.</p>
