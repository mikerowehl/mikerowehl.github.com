  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/software/03/12/14/1545216.shtml?tid=132&amp;tid=151&amp;tid=82">an article at NewsForge</a> about the effort that Bob Kerr has made to get open source software into public libraries. The article serves as a great example of how the challenges of promoting wider open source adoption can be overcome. Plus I  think the cause itself is fantastic. Bob has apparently been working to get libraries in Scotland to include CDs containing open source software in their collections. With most of the people there still on dialup, downloading large packages like Mozilla or OpenOffice is difficult. He&#8217;s been trying to get copies of the software made available at the library. Excellent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was getting ready a couple of blog posts on the topic of rapid prototyping, but decided instead to put the information on <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/prototyping.html">a permanent page</a> on the Bitsplitter site. The information is apparently pretty randomly organized, but I still wanted to put it up. I think it&#8217;s a pretty good list of issues to keep in mind and goals to strive for.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on getting new technical products and services together for 10 years, but it&#8217;s only recently that I&#8217;ve become aware of some of the benefits of rapid prototyping that lie outside of that technical realm. Now that I&#8217;ve started reading a few books on the topic I realize that there are other people who have developed these ideas very fully. This is my attempt to call out some of the existing literature about rapid prototyping and tie it to the everyday concerns of anyone working on a completely new project or service. It can be very stressful and isolating at times. It&#8217;s a relief to see that others have observed the same issues and can provide some stirring insight. That page deals primarily with software and embedded systems projects, but I welcome <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">feedback</a> from just about any area. Let me know what you think, or tell me what major issues you&#8217;ve encountered. I would love to hear from all you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an excellent <a href="http://www.innovationtools.com/Articles/ArticleDetails.asp?a=113">article at Innovation Tools</a> about methods used to capture ideas when they come to you. I think that most of the Palm based tools for capturing ideas are pretty underdeveloped. A while ago I was considering writing a Palm app to do something like the mind map described in the article (although at the time I didn&#8217;t know it was called a mind map). Now that I&#8217;ve read the article, it sounds like it might make a good app for the pilot. Especially the Clie and OS5 devices with larger screens. I normally carry my PDA around with me to jot down little ideas. But when I don&#8217;t have it with me, I SMS a message to my email address (my provider has a SMS to email gateway).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just went over to see Damjan Lampret present the work on OpenRISC at the <a href="http://freedomtechnologycenter.org/">Freedom Technology Center</a>. The presentation was great, it gave lots of info about the project that it&#8217;s hard to get (as a software weenie) trying to just look at the <a href="http://www.opencores.org/projects/or1k/Home">stuff up at OpenCores about the project</a>. What I learned is that most of the details of OpenRISC are probably over my head, unless I want to invest a lot in the EDA tools necessary to familiarize myself with how the system as a whole works.  I&#8217;ll keep fooling with the <a href="http://www.opencores.org/projects/or1k/Architectural%20Simulator">simulator</a> and waiting for a project that lets me justify the cost of getting some of the toys.</p>

<p>But perhaps even more interesting was that I&#8217;ve noticed the presence of the <a href="http://freedomtechnologycenter.org/">Freedom Technology Center</a>, which has just started up. The classes they have look like they could be very interesting. And it&#8217;s certainly in a good location for building up a great local community. They&#8217;ve just started operating, so keep an eye on the website for more info. I&#8217;ve subscribed to the announcement list actually, so I&#8217;ll post here the interesting updates that come out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://loosewire.typepad.com/blog/2003/12/rfid_secretly_t.html">post over at LOOSEwire</a> pointing to an article in the Washington Post about RFID being used in tags at The Internet Summit. It strikes me as Reporters without Borders just fearmongering, using the common pain point of RFID to drum up some sympathy. RFID has gotten so much negative press, and I think it&#8217;s just cause the undereducated contingent of the privacy sector has latched onto it. Sure, there are plenty of issues to be worked through with RFID, but it&#8217;s hardly the boogeyman that everyone makes it out to be. A cell phone can just as easily (and in the future, more easily most likely) be used to determine a users location. RFID tags are extremely short range devices, and pathetically easy to defeat, jam, and disable. They&#8217;re getting used in lots of applications because the tech guys are having trouble finding an application where they actually work more often than they fail. They can provide some benefit, if used correctly. I would love for my environment to be aware of me and itself, so that more of my everyday life could be automated and I could have more time for human interaction. This is what a lot of technology does. But for some reason the only mainstream press that RFID gets is negative. I would urge people to read up on RFID a bit before buying into the fearmongering that privacy groups are engaged in. There are issues that should be addressed with RFID. But just jumping up and screaming &#8220;witch, burn them!!!&#8221; whenever someone uses the technology is not going to result in progress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/mobile/2003/1208mobile1.html?fsrc=rss-bigfeed">an article at Network World Fusion</a> pointing to some information released by Intel about how much wireless has boosted their productivity. Umm.. this is the same Intel that&#8217;s waist deep in Centrino, its new chipset for wireless that it&#8217;s been pimping left and right? I find this to be a bit lacking in terms of journalism. Of course Intel says that wireless is cool, and of course if they have supporting data it&#8217;s nice of them to release it. But I would expect at least a bit of a mention of the fact that the information about wireless productivity gains is being provided by a company with a weighted interest in selling those wireless systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve released the 1.6 version of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>, which contains fixes for using accented characters with Blogger.com and an option to post without publishing. I&#8217;ve had trouble getting accented characters working in Wordpress and Movable Type however.  I think the issue is actually with the tools, although I could be wrong.  I&#8217;ve done a bunch of checking around in the XML spec and looking up information about unicode and iso-8859-1 and utf-8, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that the accented characters I&#8217;m putting in are correctly specified. But it looks like somewhere along the line they get mangled. I&#8217;ll have to do a little more poking around, but if someone is familiar with using the xmlrpc interfaces to either Wordpress or Movable Type to post messages with characters outside of the ASCII character set, please <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">drop me a line</a> and let me know if you have any tricks.</p>

The results were great. In particular, Jason Shellen says that he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2003_12_01_default.asp#107111749278187386">getting as much of the Blogger crew as he can</a> to come out and join the event.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=29">an interview with Adam Bosworth</a> over at ACM Queue, and it touches on some ideas I&#8217;ve had in relation to mobile application. There is a lot of stuff that I don&#8217;t agree with at all in that article, such as modeling of web services upon the web browser/web site interaction. I&#8217;m hoping that&#8217;s an artifact of the interview, and not what our cutting edge service deployment experts are really thinking. Because if they think that HTML is a good example of contract based programming, and that further server to server interactions should be based upon it, I&#8217;m definitely going to have to keep steering clear of enterprize application settings.</p>

<p>But there is an interest trend brought up in the move towards more message oriented formats. This is another example of people catching on to the ideas that I remember hearing about from the <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> guys literally 4 years ago. They used to go on and on about how applications should be constructed based upon async messages and queues. Mostly I think people laughed at them, which is too bad. Now that mobile communication devices are actually becoming commonplace, questions about syncing up the information in them are more relevant.  When you just had your Palm Pilot it was easy to sync. Some people synced at work and at home, and it was all good for them. But now information lives all over, and the old sync model doesn&#8217;t work. All of a sudden those funny Jabber ideas start to make a whole lot of sense. People are saying things like &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be great if when I added a contact to my phone it would automatically get sent to all my devices!?!?!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s not a new idea. These are the kinds of alternate apps that Jabber is built for. In this model each device and application is a client to the IM network. When a contact is added from one device or application it sends a message to the server, and that message is queued for all of the devices in a clients listening group. Each of those apps and devices can then login at any point and get the updates. I think this is actually the direction that Palm is going to be gunning for with their embrace of Web Services and their attempt to make PalmOS 6 more &#8220;network centric&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they pushed these kinds of sync functions straight down into the operating system/database interfaces.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://mozillaquest.com/Linux03/OpenOffice-Calc-Contact_Story01.html">article at MozillaQuest.com</a> describing how to do the basic spreadsheet formatting operations necessary to setup a simple table of text. Actually very usefull for me, cause I&#8217;ve never learned how to use a spreadsheet at all. The stuff there is really basic, and could be picked up in just a few minutes of poking if you have a general computer skills background. But it&#8217;s nice to have a nice basic layout to introduce the basic common features and where to find them. It&#8217;s great to see articles like this being produced. There seem to be a few articles of the same kind linked off of MozillaQuest, such as an article about using OpenOffice to create a newsletter. Awsome! I hope to see a lot more.</p>
