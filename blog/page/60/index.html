  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/mobile/2003/1208mobile1.html?fsrc=rss-bigfeed">an article at Network World Fusion</a> pointing to some information released by Intel about how much wireless has boosted their productivity. Umm.. this is the same Intel that&#8217;s waist deep in Centrino, its new chipset for wireless that it&#8217;s been pimping left and right? I find this to be a bit lacking in terms of journalism. Of course Intel says that wireless is cool, and of course if they have supporting data it&#8217;s nice of them to release it. But I would expect at least a bit of a mention of the fact that the information about wireless productivity gains is being provided by a company with a weighted interest in selling those wireless systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve released the 1.6 version of <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">Vagablog</a>, which contains fixes for using accented characters with Blogger.com and an option to post without publishing. I&#8217;ve had trouble getting accented characters working in Wordpress and Movable Type however.  I think the issue is actually with the tools, although I could be wrong.  I&#8217;ve done a bunch of checking around in the XML spec and looking up information about unicode and iso-8859-1 and utf-8, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that the accented characters I&#8217;m putting in are correctly specified. But it looks like somewhere along the line they get mangled. I&#8217;ll have to do a little more poking around, but if someone is familiar with using the xmlrpc interfaces to either Wordpress or Movable Type to post messages with characters outside of the ASCII character set, please <a href="mailto:miker@bitsplitter.net">drop me a line</a> and let me know if you have any tricks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the horrid turnout of the last <a href="http://blog.meetup.com">Weblog Meetup</a>, I did a little web crawling and emailed the people that I could find who were signed up for the event. The results were great. In particular, Jason Shellen says that he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2003_12_01_default.asp#107111749278187386">getting as much of the Blogger crew as he can</a> to come out and join the event. Yay!! Thanks Jason. And to the rest of you, I hope to see you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=29">an interview with Adam Bosworth</a> over at ACM Queue, and it touches on some ideas I&#8217;ve had in relation to mobile application. There is a lot of stuff that I don&#8217;t agree with at all in that article, such as modeling of web services upon the web browser/web site interaction. I&#8217;m hoping that&#8217;s an artifact of the interview, and not what our cutting edge service deployment experts are really thinking. Because if they think that HTML is a good example of contract based programming, and that further server to server interactions should be based upon it, I&#8217;m definitely going to have to keep steering clear of enterprize application settings.</p>

<p>But there is an interest trend brought up in the move towards more message oriented formats. This is another example of people catching on to the ideas that I remember hearing about from the <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> guys literally 4 years ago. They used to go on and on about how applications should be constructed based upon async messages and queues. Mostly I think people laughed at them, which is too bad. Now that mobile communication devices are actually becoming commonplace, questions about syncing up the information in them are more relevant.  When you just had your Palm Pilot it was easy to sync. Some people synced at work and at home, and it was all good for them. But now information lives all over, and the old sync model doesn&#8217;t work. All of a sudden those funny Jabber ideas start to make a whole lot of sense. People are saying things like &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be great if when I added a contact to my phone it would automatically get sent to all my devices!?!?!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s not a new idea. These are the kinds of alternate apps that Jabber is built for. In this model each device and application is a client to the IM network. When a contact is added from one device or application it sends a message to the server, and that message is queued for all of the devices in a clients listening group. Each of those apps and devices can then login at any point and get the updates. I think this is actually the direction that Palm is going to be gunning for with their embrace of Web Services and their attempt to make PalmOS 6 more &#8220;network centric&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they pushed these kinds of sync functions straight down into the operating system/database interfaces.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://mozillaquest.com/Linux03/OpenOffice-Calc-Contact_Story01.html">article at MozillaQuest.com</a> describing how to do the basic spreadsheet formatting operations necessary to setup a simple table of text. Actually very usefull for me, cause I&#8217;ve never learned how to use a spreadsheet at all. The stuff there is really basic, and could be picked up in just a few minutes of poking if you have a general computer skills background. But it&#8217;s nice to have a nice basic layout to introduce the basic common features and where to find them. It&#8217;s great to see articles like this being produced. There seem to be a few articles of the same kind linked off of MozillaQuest, such as an article about using OpenOffice to create a newsletter. Awsome! I hope to see a lot more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100252">article over at The Feature</a> about a company called Wireless Ink. Wireless Ink is running <a href="http://winksite.com/site/index.cfm">a moblogging service</a> with hopes of extending it&#8217;s offering out to social networking apps in general. I like the position, as I&#8217;m into the mobile networking issue in general. And it seems like they&#8217;re really concentrating on the use of the technology, not just the technology itself (an essential element missing from most mobile application offerings).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m over at the Open Source Expo, sitting in the business track. Cause the business side is definitely where I&#8217;m weak. An interesting point came up during the investment panel related to the factors that realy stick out in the investor&#8217;s mind when looking at a company. Of course they take a look at the business plan of the company overall, but there were two qualifying factors that stuck out to me. The first is that the company has to be solving a hard problem. This is the same as the &#8220;barrier to entry&#8221; issue I&#8217;ve heard from <a href="http://www.proteanstrategy.com">Eleanor (my strategy consultant)</a> before. The second is that investors look particularly for solutions which revolutionize a whole vertical. An example given here was a CIO mandating replacing their existing platform with open source across the board.  OS, tools, database, the whole shebang. And enabling this for particular verticals is something that investors really look favorably upon. It&#8217;s a good summary of what to aim for I think, and it really helps out to describe what I do quite well. For many companies looking to explore using open source I can help provide those additional peices that enable them to clear the whole vertical.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have the 1.5 release of Vagablog <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/">up on the Vagablog page</a>. The updates are relatively minor, but it explicitly says that WordPress and Movable Type are supported. And when Movable Type is being used, it hides the extra fields on the main screen. Maybe this will cut down on people misunderstanding Title field. I was hoping that people using the roll-your-own tools would at least skim the setup docs on the web. I should have known better. Now they just shouldn&#8217;t even be tempted. I&#8217;m planning to do the Metaweblog API soon, so that Movable Type does get title support.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a post over at Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s blog titled <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001189.html">TrackBack and Corporate Secrets</a>. It gives one example where traditionally convenient blogging features can be a pain for businesses. Blogs are moving into areas where the culture is significantly different than where they came from. Requirements of a business user can be radically different than those of the public blogger. Features which were convenient turn into security risks quite easily, as Jeremy points out. It can be painful, it can be dangerous, but that&#8217;s really what makes it interesting. I think blogs will play a big part in corporate infrastructure in the coming years. They fulfill the requirements of fluid communication in a way that no mix of technologies has been able to before. However, the reason they fulfill the requirements is because they grew up without many borders or limits, and that runs counter to the current corporate culture. So what happens when a new technology comes along that does a great job of solving a fundamental problem while also bringing along contradictory culture? I admit, I have no idea. But whatever it ends up being, I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s not &#8220;business as usual&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve posted <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/PalmHTTP/">the 2.0 version of PalmHTTP</a> on the Bitsplitter site, and reformated that page while I was at it. The interface to the library itself is now quite different, with covers for dealing with the URL struct, a POST struct and covers to deal with it, settings for the content type, and two example programs now. There&#8217;s still quite a bit to do, but the lib works for what I do, so the other stuff will probably just creep in over time. I&#8217;m accepting patches for it, of course.
