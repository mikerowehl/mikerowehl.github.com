    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog has been dormant for a long time, but I&#8217;ve decided to start it back
up. I created the site cause I wanted a Wordpress install
I could test my PalmOS based mobile blogging client against. But once I had
the site
up and running I started tossing all sorts of random stuff in. Everything from
my own thoughts on <a href="http://mikerowehl.github.com/blog/2006/04/02/high-availability-nfs/">scalability</a>
to summaries of events
about <a href="http://mikerowehl.github.com/blog/2005/04/15/make-almost-anything/">the FabLab</a>.
However, after a few years of tossing all sorts of random stuff in here I
started to really focus on mobile, so I
created a mobile specific site called
<a href="http://thisismobility.com/blog">This is Mobility</a> so that I wouldn&#8217;t have
everything all jumbled together. Then with
so much interesting stuff happening in mobile this blog eventually fell into
disuse. And it&#8217;s remained unused since 2006.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve felt getting a little more randomness going again is a good
idea. And I&#8217;m really happy I kept all these blog posts around to read,
so I could get a peek back into my mind 10 years ago and remind myself what it
was like. When I started reading through these posts I figured that&#8217;s all I
would do, read and then put it aside. But I realized how different my
thought process was a few years ago. And not just cause I was young and
naive, but because I was looking at things without the encumbrance of much
bias. &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">Beginner&#8217;s mind</a>&#8221; is probably
the best term for it. That beginners mind
decided that Linux and open source were a good bet for building online
services. And that beginners mind decided that homesteading a spot in the
mobile world was a good idea back in 2003. I wouldn&#8217;t pass on getting a bit
more of that beginners mind, and it seemed like writing
here again could help with that process. With the site also being 10 years
also, it seemed somehow proper to bring it back.</p>

<p>Of course, some updating needed to be done. While I love Wordpress for
some things, I&#8217;m also getting tired of it getting exploited and abused cause I
pay so little attention to it. It&#8217;s my own fault for not updating it, but I
really like the option of swapping to something I don&#8217;t need to pay attention
to instead of modifying my behavior.  So I swapped over to using
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>,
which
uses post files written in markdown to generate the site as a static set of
pages (hat tip to <a href="http://fusion94.org/">Tony</a> for the suggestion).
Thanks to a fantastic set of scripts called
<a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a> I was able to move
an export of my Wordpress data right into Octopress friendly format.
Yay! That should be the end of Viagra and Levitra ads randomly
appearing at the end of my posts. And as a bonus I can publish the whole thing
through Github Pages, and store the source in Github. Which I was doing with
the rowehl.com site anyway, but had to take special care to backup the
database to keep blog posts safe. Now it&#8217;s all just one repo.
And cause the pages are hosted directly off Github, when I crash
my personal server doing Linux distro hackery I don&#8217;t take down rowehl.com.</p>

<p>Also nice about Octopress - the default profile takes a responsive
approach. So now my personal blog looks better on mobile than my mobile
focused blog. With the way the Octopress templates and plugins are
structured it was pretty easy to make some style changes, swap in some fonts
that make the site look a little less amateur hour. I got rid of commenting
all together and have added some share buttons instead, cause that&#8217;s how the
world works now. Everyone already has their own place to speak, so why put
their thoughts into my database? And again, once less thing for me to worry
about.</p>

<p>In the end, actually not much effort at all. And I&#8217;m really happy with how it
works. Now I have a place to write about all that other
not-specifically-mobile stuff like cool bits of open source, programming,
emerging technologies, and startups. And to remind myself just how far things
have come, I dug up and posted the
<a href="https://github.com/mikerowehl/vagablog">source code</a> to the Treo650 blogging
app that kicked this whole thing off 10 years ago.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was just installing the Sun JDK on my workstation at the office, and when I tried the obvious: apt-get install sun-java5-bin got an error message about not being able to find a license. Interesting, thought I, &#8220;there must be a higher level package wrappering this whole thing that deposits a license file somewhere for the apt-get process to pick up&#8221;. A bunch  of searching around in the repository listings turned up no java license related packages.</p>

<p>You find where <a href="http://www.aspma.com/downloads/">download mp3 music</a> on player, You need <a href="http://www.aspma.com/download/">mp3 music download</a> from online mp3 archive</p>

<p>So I did a search and ended up with <a href="https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/ubuntu.html">this description of installing Java under Ubuntu</a> which says pretty much what I was doing, except using the graphical package manager instead. &#8220;How lame would it be if you needed to install Java using the Synaptic package manager instead of the command line?&#8221; Not lame enough to discourage doing it apparently. If you&#8217;re looking to install Java under Ubuntu you might have to use the package manager instead of apt-get in order to do it. Next time you see Java people throw rotten fruit at them to let them know how you feel about that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apparently Firefox 2 has inline spellcheck right out of the box.  Werd, I&#8217;m looking forward to it.  However, my Ubuntu systems still have Firefox 1.5.x and I don&#8217;t want to start mucking around now that I&#8217;ve just started accepting I don&#8217;t need to build everything by hand. Start pulling on that thread again and whole thing comes apart!</p>

<p>Normally I use a plugin for spell checking, but it stopped working a few updates ago. Firefox or the extension claims that they are no longer friends. So I was very happy to find the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=351130">development preview</a> of SpellBound, which not only works with the current Firefox releases under Ubuntu, but does inline spellcheck. Double w00t to that one.  I have it installed at home, as long as it doesn&#8217;t cause any problems I&#8217;ll put it in here at work too.</p>

    <id>http://mikerowehl.github.com/blog/2006/08/23/http_load-for-request-replay</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://talks.php.net/show/oscon06/0">presentation that Rasmus gave at OSCON</a> this year seems to have kicked some ass. I missed the conf, but got a bunch of interesting info from the slides. In particular I hadn&#8217;t used <a href="http://www.acme.com/software/http_load/">http_load</a> before. Part of what I&#8217;ve been doing at AdMob is taking a look at performance and scaling, so that was a great find. It&#8217;s exactly the set of controls and measurements I normally start out with, and it really does run very efficiently in terms of not loading down the system that http_load is running on.</p>

<p>Just about the only thing that didn&#8217;t work the way I wanted was the random selection from the url list file. I wanted to replay a set of traffic in order, so I <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/http_load-miker-01patch.txt">hacked up an -orderedurls option</a> to select from the url list sequentially (repeating the list once you get to the end) instead of randomly choosing. Reading the whole file in and parsing it probably isn&#8217;t the way to go for this particular usage, so I&#8217;ll have to clean it up when the traffic segments I&#8217;m playing get into the millions instead of just the tens of thousands. But it works great for now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s just about New Laptop Time. Not quite, but almost. Being a Linux only user it&#8217;s always an adventure trying to figure out what hardware to get. Hardware support has definitely gotten better under Linux, but figuring out what actually lives inside the system you&#8217;re thinking about picking up at deep discount from Office Max certainly has not. And I&#8217;m not a dual-booter either. I don&#8217;t have Windows to fall back on should something not work on my laptop. I take a scorched earth approach to Windows on my hardware, and generally wipe and repave the whole thing. Especially if it&#8217;s my personal laptop, which is what I plan for this to be.</p>

<p>Currently I&#8217;m leaning very heavily toward <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X41_Tablet">the Thinkpad X41 tablet</a>. It looks like there&#8217;s good X support for a bunch of stuff that&#8217;s traditionally a pain in the ass under Linux. Screen rotation seems to be working (without restarting X, thank god), the input driver for the touchscreen, power management (including frequency scaling), and wireless using ipw2200. Anyone out there with an X41 tried Linux and care to toss in some comments before I pick one of the things up? It&#8217;s hard to tell from wiki postings just how painful is it to get the thing actually setup, and there&#8217;s always the chance that the instructions on the wiki are wrong or incomplete.</p>

<p>On a very much related note, anyone know a good shop in the San Francisco Bay Area that could come up with some Pimp My Ride style dashboard mounting and wiring hookups for my car?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week (August 7th to 13th 2006) is the <a href="http://www.01sj.org/">ZeroOne Arts Festival in San Jose</a>. There was a <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/02/art_on_the_edge.html">great presentation at Future Salon by one of the ZeroOne staff members</a> where he tossed out a dizzying number of art projects that blend in technology in tantalizing ways. And if the interesting art projects weren&#8217;t enough to get you down there on their own, on Friday there&#8217;s a <a href="http://01sj.org/content/view/217/52/">Survival Research Labs</a> exhibition:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;it’s monster machine, meets hovercraft, meets huge sculptural creatures, meets fire.</p></blockquote>

<p>What better way to spend a Friday night? I have just one question.. tickets through Ticketmaster?  Is that part of the tongue in cheek techno-social commentary? That despite the rapid advance of technology in general the only way to throw a huge ticketed real world event is to use Ticketmaster? We&#8217;ll have to work on a project for the next one that fixes that issue.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m at almost a quarter of a million spam messages (249,744 to be precise, by the time I post this it should be more than 250 thousand) caught by <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> so far. I <a href="http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=605">turned Akismet on in January of this year</a>. That&#8217;s more than 50,000 spam messages a month. According to the Akismet site 92% of the comments it sees are spam.</p>

<p>The problem is very unevenly distributed however. I have a few other blogs out there, and they tend to get more like a few hundred spam messages a month. I just wanted to point that out given the degree of blowup I see when things happen like <a href="http://announcements.engadget.com/2006/05/30/comments-switched-off/">someone has to turn off comments for a while</a>. The spam problem is not uniformly distributed, just because you get a managable ammount of spam comments that doesn&#8217;t mean someone who blogs about just about the same stuff isn&#8217;t getting hundreds of times more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I need to post a <a href="http://www.tomrafteryit.net/oreilly-trademarks-web-20-and-sets-lawyers-on-itcork/">pointer to the story about CMP sending a conference a C&D; letter on behalf of O&#8217;Reilly</a>. I&#8217;m sure Tim has nothing to do with it, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll go away without much fuss in the end, probably just being throwoff of the corporate machine and the result of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. And of course having lawyers involved, which always screws things up. But it is interesting that something like this would happen in relation to a company that has built its business on being ahead of the knowledge curve, and I would say doing it successfully.</p>

<p>Things like this are bound to happen in any organization/company once the size gets beyond a certain threshold. Perhaps not quite this ridiculous in most cases, but there will be some evidence of lack of syncronization and goal mismatches. In the real world normally this stuff gets cleared up pretty quick. Tim pops up and says &#8220;wow, we didn&#8217;t mean to do that, sorry!&#8221; or someone at CMP chews the lawyers out and releases a statement&#8230; whatever. The point being that inconsistencies and unexpected situations are generally noticed and dealt with. Outside the blogospere at least. Inside the blogosphere they can live on forever, but that&#8217;s really a whole seperate issue.</p>

<p>Odd situations like that tend to cause failures in software though. When something unexpected comes up within a system it&#8217;s generally catastrophic. When something unexpected comes up during an interaction between systems you&#8217;re sometimes lucky just to find out what happened after the fact. I&#8217;ve been thinking about self healing systems recently, although I can&#8217;t remember what might have kicked it off. And after reading this realized that almost all human designed systems are relatively fragile and rigid. Law being one of the obvious areas of intersection between codification and human behavior I would expect it might hold some hints about how to handle that well. But law is just guidelines, and the rationality really derives from a human in the loop pulling the strings, judge or jurry. It&#8217;s not a system itself really so much as an extension and recording of the will of the judges to keep them from having to repeat themselves. So I keep coming back to the non-human systems to try to find isolated systems that heal well. Insect behavior is one of the classic examples, ants and bees.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some <a href="http://www.tuttletimes.com/siteSearch/apstorysection/local_story_088201244.html">additional info about the politician who incorrectly threatened CentOS with FBI action</a>. Gotta love this:</p>

<blockquote><p>“This is just a bunch of freaks out there that don’t have anything better to do,” he said. “When I came in to work Monday morning, I had about 500 e-mails, plus anonymous phone calls from all the geeks out there. [CentOS is] a free operating system that this guy gives away, which tells you how much time he’s got on his hands.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nice, very nice. Unfortunately we can&#8217;t all resort to threats and scare tactics to get our work done for us. Or can we&#8230;.?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve tried out the <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/high_availability_nfs_drbd_heartbeat">high availability NFS solution detailed here</a> and run into a few issues. It does provide a great way to get a higher degree of availability for one of the most problematic bits of infrastructure, so I don&#8217;t mean to crap on the idea as a whole. But here are two issues to make sure you either check out or understand before you deploy something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We saw write throughput cut in half when DRBD was up and running. If you&#8217;ve got plenty of capacity and can segment as you grow you might be more concerned with the availability than the throughput. And it&#8217;s certainly possible that we could have performed some tuning to get DRBD to perform better. I&#8217;m just saying perform some benchmarks beforehand and afterward to make sure you&#8217;re not impacting the system too negatively without knowing it.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a block level replication technique, so there&#8217;s no guarantee that a filesystem level error that causes corruption isn&#8217;t just replicated over to the failover box as it happens. True, it&#8217;s much more common that the failure mode be bad blocks at the hardware level than an error at the OS level&#8230;. but once again this is block level replication. A bad block on the master side that goes undetected for even a single read/write cycle will have that incorrect information replicated to the slave. As far as I know (and I admit I haven&#8217;t researched this in a while) there isn&#8217;t a Linux filesystem that does end to end checksumming to prevent this kind of issue.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just two things to keep in mind. There&#8217;s some great info in that article in general, like moving the NFS runtime files out to the replicated block device and how to configure heartbeat.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These SMS.ac folks just don&#8217;t know when to quit. I was chatting with <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com">Russ</a> yesterday and this morning, and he was saying that the SMS.ac people are sending him takedown letters for non-libelous content on his blog because he&#8217;s ranked pretty high in the Google search results. I told him to just take down the stuff cause it&#8217;s not worth the effort. I&#8217;m not a lawyer or anything, but I did watch Law and Order this one time and it didn&#8217;t look too hard. And then I figured, wouldn&#8217;t it be a real ball buster if a whole bunch of people <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com">linked to Russ&#8217;s blog with SMS.ac in the link text</a>, so he&#8217;s still in the top search results for them even after doing everything they ask.  I think it would be, and I think it&#8217;s like, totally justified. That&#8217;s the great thing about scammers and spammers, you can do whatever you want to them and you don&#8217;t have to feel bad.</p>
