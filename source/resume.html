      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hacker, programmer, entrepreneur</p>

        <p>I work particularly well at the very early stage of companies.
           The proverbial two or three people in a garage trying to get
           things off the ground.  I create the most value making computers
           work - everything from operations and database admin
           through front end programming and web stuff. But there's a
           whole mess of things I do at least well. I've been working in
           mobile for a long time, and done a lot of work with Linux for
           example.</p>

          We're working on addressing some of the lingering problems in
          mobile advertising. There's a ton of mobile inventory out there,
          but it's hard to find the right place to put your message and figure
          out if you've really been effective. So we provide a
          system to support smarter media buying through tighter targeting
          using data we've pulled together from a wide range of sources and
          coupled to operational systems.

      <h2>Other</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>I have a personal blog I write focused on mobile, both technology 
           and business, called <a href="http://thisismobility.com/blog">This
           is Mobility</a>. Certainly not the most widely read site in mobile,
           but it goes back to 2005. Evidence of a little bit of street cred
           if nothing else.</p>

        <p>Founder of Mobile Monday Silicon Valley
           (<a href="http://mobilemonday.us">http://mobilemonday.us</a>).
           Mobile Monday is a gathering of a few hundred mobile enthusiasts
           and practitioners.  Participants are a cross-section of
           developers, entrepreneurs, manufacturers, publishers, carriers,
           researchers, students, and others.  I started the group with some
           friends in 2003 as a gathering of mobile geeks. But after 
           connecting with some other like-minded folks running chapters in
           other areas the group has grown into an international movement.
           Information about Mobile Monday as a whole is available at 
           <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.net/">mobilemonday.net</a>.</p>

        <p>Member of the organizational team that runs the Mobile 2.0
           Conference in San Francisco and Barcelona
           (<a href="http://mobile2event.com">http://mobile2event.com</a>).
           It's an event that pulls in representatives from companies all
           over the world to focus on the mobile web and disruptive mobile
           innovation.  We started doing it in 2005 and talking about the
           mobile web... so now we look pretty damn smart.</p>
