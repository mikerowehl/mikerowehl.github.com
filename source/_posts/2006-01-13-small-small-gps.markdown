Aww yea, starting up the [talk about implanted electronics](http://engadget.com/2006/01/12/new-zealands-rakon-develops-worlds-smallest-gps-receiver/) is a sure way to get my attention. Although knowing GPS you could probably get the chip implanted subcutaneous but then need a large dish antenna grafted to your forehead in order to use it, and it would still only work outside under clear conditions. I wonder if maybe I could just plan to hook it up to the adamantium in the skeletal grafts I have planned and use that for reception? I wonder where I'll have to store the maps to go along with it... I don't want to think about it.

Update: Russ just pasted me [this South Park image](http://images.southparkstudios.com/media/images/101/satelite_dish.gif) to go along with the post, and I just wanted to share. Fricking hysterical.
