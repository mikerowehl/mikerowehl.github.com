Apparently [mammals can regenerate too](http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,16417002%255E30417,00.html). And injecting fetal liver cells is enough to get an existing organism regenerating. No retrovirus needed or anything, how cool is that? Good news for all of us aspiring to superherohood (or supervillianhood). Now I just have to figure out how to graft [adamantium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamantium) and I'll [be all set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_%28comics%29).
