I'm pretty sure I've seen [this page on the Inverted Pyramid writing style](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9606.html) before, but it was still interesting to read. It describes the atributes of good journalistic articles, which are written in a way that encourage the reader to stop whenever they get bored. Instead of writing a story that builds up piece by piece, a story is written with the main point right up front and varying levels of detail later on. It's a good principle to keep in mind. I know that I normally set about writing pages more like writing essays from college. And that's not the way that online content should be presented for most of what I do.
