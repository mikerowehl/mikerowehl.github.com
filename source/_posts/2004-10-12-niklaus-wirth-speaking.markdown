Niklaus Wirth is [speaking at the Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?id=1097188078) in Mountain View on the topic "How I Became Interested in Programming Languages". Wirth is one of those names that pops up over and over again in computer science, like Knuth. I've never heard him speak before, and I'm certainly not going to pass up the opportunity to. An RSVP is required, so visit that link and fill out the registration info if you're planning to go.
