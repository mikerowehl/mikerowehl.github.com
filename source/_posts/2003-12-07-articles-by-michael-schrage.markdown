I've been reading [Serious Play](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0875848141/qid%3D995128392/sr%3D2-1/ref%3Daps%5Fsr%5Fb%5F1%5F1/102-5381366-7152162) by Michael Schrage, and have found it extremely stimulating thus far. The book explores the basic "what role does the prototype play in innovation" type questions and the harder questions of how to manage a prototyping portfolio and how the various tradeoffs in prototyping can affect the shape of innovation as a whole. I wanted to read more, and I happened across [this great site with links to lots of his articles](http://www.manyworlds.com/index.asp?from=TL&coid=CO9300216205890). [ManyWorlds](http://www.manyworlds.com) seems like a great site in general, but I've only looked at the Schrage stuff so far. I would highly recommend checking out the articles, and picking up the book (I borrowed it from our local library actually) if you like what you see. The articles and the book are both insightful and thought provoking.
