[ETech talk from the founder of Wikipedia](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/5907).
 Wikipedia addresses the original dream of the internet: people sharing information. The early services worked well for a while. There were some problems though:







  * quality control


  * the information is the view of one individual


  * Author fatigue, the author gets bored and the page is a dead spot on the web





wikicities, 170 communities online, free license. For profit, portion of profits to to wikimedia foundation. Having the information for the community managed via wiki overcomes those major problems that plagued sites like geocities. Relies on the kind of social model that arose from the Wikipedia. Software does not enforce social rules, the rules aren't even set down in advance.







  * Wikipedia is a social innovation.


  * This social innocation will spread to other areas beyond encyclo


  * Software which enables colloboration is the future of the net
