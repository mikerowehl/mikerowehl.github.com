Thanks to [Grant Schofield](http://contest.bakankin.com/), who informed me that there was something wonky with comments on this blog. I ended up with a typo after my last spam filtering additions.  Sorry if there are others trying to comment who haven't been able. It should be all nice and cooperative now.
