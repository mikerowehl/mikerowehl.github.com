Greg Gershman from Blogdigger is [in town for a little bit](http://www.blogdigger.com/blog/2005/02/14/1108421226000.html) and wanted to do a get together.  The plan is to meet up at Jing Jing downtown Palo Alto at 6:30pm on Wed Feb 16th. Here's a [map](http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&country=US&addtohistory=&searchtab=home&address=443+Emerson+Street&city=palo+alto&state=ca&zipcode=) for those who need one. Getting to Jing Jing from the Palto Alto Caltrain station is a snap too, for those coming in by train. Take Lytton the only way you can, left onto Emerson, Jing Jing is visable from that corner less than a block away.
