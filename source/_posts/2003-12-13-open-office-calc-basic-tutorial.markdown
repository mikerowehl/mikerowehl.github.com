There's an [article at MozillaQuest.com](http://mozillaquest.com/Linux03/OpenOffice-Calc-Contact_Story01.html) describing how to do the basic spreadsheet formatting operations necessary to setup a simple table of text. Actually very usefull for me, cause I've never learned how to use a spreadsheet at all. The stuff there is really basic, and could be picked up in just a few minutes of poking if you have a general computer skills background. But it's nice to have a nice basic layout to introduce the basic common features and where to find them. It's great to see articles like this being produced. There seem to be a few articles of the same kind linked off of MozillaQuest, such as an article about using OpenOffice to create a newsletter. Awsome! I hope to see a lot more.
