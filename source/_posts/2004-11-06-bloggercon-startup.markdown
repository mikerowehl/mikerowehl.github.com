[BloggerCon](http://www.bloggercon.org/) is under way this morning. I'm over at my apartment listening to the [ITConversations](http://www.itconversations.com/) cast instead of heading over to Stanford. I might wander over at some point, but this morning started with a mad dash to peice back together [Elle's blog](http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/) from SQL dumps. Never fun. So I think I'm just going to sit here and drink coffee and watch what goes through in IRC for a while (#bloggercon on freenode.net).

So what's come through the pipe so far? Everyone seemed to love the comments that [Tony Kahn](http://www.theworld.org/about/bios/kahn.shtml) made when he introduced himself. He's over there and interested in talking about the intersection of blogging type activities and the future of Public Broadcasting. Tag your photos in [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) as 'bloggercon' so that we can see them [in the tag listing](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bloggercon). Kevin Marks dropped in [a Technorati link giving most talked about MP3s](http://www.technorati.com/live/topmp3s.html). The bloggercon sessions should show up there once they get uploaded.
