There's [an interview with the authors of OpenGardens over at the Mobile Technology Weblog](http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/interview_with_ajit_jaokar_and_tony_fish.html). I'm hadn't heard of [the OpenGardens book](http://www.opengardens.net) before, but I would certainly like to get my hands on a copy. They say they talk about one of the issues I've written about a number of times: how to get an innovative mobile application out into the market given the current environment. If anyone has gotten a chance to check it out please drop me a line or leave a comment here.
