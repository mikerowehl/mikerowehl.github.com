[Dave McClure](http://www.500hats.com/sys-tmpl/door/) and [Jeff Clavier](http://www.softtechvc.com/) are putting together [Vertical Leap, a vertical search conference](http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/05/introducing_ver.html). The event is [being run through SDForum](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1680).  And of course I just recently let my SDForum membership lapse because I haven't been as interested in their events as I have been in the free stuff. If getting folks like Dave and Jeff involved is a general trend and not an isolated coincidence I'll have to renew my membership.

[BayCHI put on a fantastic panel on search last month](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=486), and there's been a lot of interesting activity going on. Working at [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com) has made me even more aware of search advances than I was before, and some of the services like [jobs.feedster.com](http://jobs.feedster.com/) are exactly inline with what I expect the discussion to be about. Stuff like [structured blogging](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=503) and [microformats](http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats) to enter into the conversation at some point. I've heard pretty good arguments on both sides of the explicit vs. implicit metadata debate. I guess I really don't care which side wins out, or if it just ends up a draw. But [folks who would like to experiment with the stuff as normal users](http://www.ellementk.com/archives/2005/04/13/323) don't really have a way to, and I would like to be able to answer the questions Elle has without having to make crap up. Apparently the [tools and services are going to start growing support soon](http://worcester.typepad.com/pc4media/2005/05/structured_blog.html), I can't wait to see what falls out. I really don't want to have to implement a structured blogging parsing engine here at home, but I do have an editor window open already....
