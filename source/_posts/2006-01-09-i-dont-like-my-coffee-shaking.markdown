I think "choked down" would be an appropriate description for how I handled the last cup. And it was definitely shaking. I don't like my coffee shaking. So I just setup [cup 20](http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/84313597/) and then I'm taking a pause for at least a little while. We started at 5:30pm on Sunday. Will we make 100 cups by 5:30pm on Tuesday? It's looking a little iffy. I remain optimistic however - the challenge will continue tomorrow.
