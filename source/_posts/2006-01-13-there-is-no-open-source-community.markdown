Interesting article over at OnLamp called [There Is No Open Source Community](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/12/no_oss_community.html?page=1). Some excellent points in there, the central being that open source is not driven by ideological crusaders, but by the straightforward economic benefic of participants. I would disagree with the title of the article however. There is an open source community, definitely. It isn't what companies should be focused on while evaluating open source, it isn't the major driving contribution to the continued success of open source projects. But it is there and it does play a role in the environment. To say that it's been giving too much attention isn't probably right either, just that the time given it is out of line with the time spent looking at the basic economics of the environment. Given that, the article is an excellent attempt to start demystifying a subject that's been clouded with way too much rhetoric on both sides of the argument.
