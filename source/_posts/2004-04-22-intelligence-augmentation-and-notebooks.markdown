After seeing the [interview with Ward Cunningham](http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/Week-of-Mon-20040405/000201.html) linked to from [a post in Many2Many](http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/04/22/ward_on_social_engineering_in_a_wiki.php) I started wandering through the [archives of the luvly mailing list](http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/). There's some great stuff in there. For instance an [interview with Lion Kimbro](http://lists.dessicated.org/pipermail/luvly/Week-of-Mon-20040322/000197.html), who has released a book titled [How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought you Think](http://speakeasy.org/~lion/nb/). The book looks great, and it's released under the [Share Alike Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/). So of course I had to create [a Plucker version](http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/Lion_Kimbro_Complete_Map.pdb) so I can read it on the go. Trying to download the pdb file using [palm-torrent](http://openpalmenv.sf.net) has exposed some kind of bug there as well.. so I'm off to try to crush that.
