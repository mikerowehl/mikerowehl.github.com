Feedster was awarded [Best Overall Presentation at the Bay Area Interactive Group (BIG) Technology Shootout](http://corp.feedster.com/blog/archives/2005/02/feedster_awarde_1.html) last night. The main message presented was the future of XML based formats such as RSS and how they lead to a model that can best be summarized as "Search, Subscribe, Advertise." Search is of course a very broad topic, and subscribe very general. The first thing that pops to mind is of course searching for [all posts related to Linux](http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=linux&sort=date), and having a [feed for new posts that appear on that topic](http://feedster.com/search.php?q=linux&sort=&ie=UTF-8&hl=&content=full&type=rss&feedsterkey=2iWbnYvPbde6QlTY7qhFZq&limit=15). But RSS search is the kind of thing that can be applied in layers, almost like a recursive operation. For instance we can provide a [search for FEEDS related to Linux](http://feedfinder.feedster.com/search.php?db=feeds&sort=relevance&q=linux), and a [feed of new feeds that appear](http://feedster.com/search.php?q=linux&sort=&ie=UTF-8&hl=&content=full&type=rss&feedsterkey=2iWbnYvPbde6QlTY7qhFZq&limit=15&db=feeds). No matter how it's applied though, the general model of "Search, Subscribe, Advertise" best describes how to slot into the desired user behavior. Great job Chris!
