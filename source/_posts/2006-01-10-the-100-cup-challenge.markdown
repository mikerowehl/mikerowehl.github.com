I had to pause for a while last night so that I could get some work done. I just couldn't concentrate after 36 cups in 24 hours. I'm [back at it for a little while now though](http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/). Hopefully I'll at least make 75 cups. I got no sleep last night, so this is as much of a survival technique as a continuation of the challenge.  20 cups over the next 6 hours.. that sounds doable. Someone yesterday suggested antacids, fantastic suggestion. So I've layed down a preemptive layer of those this morning.  Those Tums chewables in assorted tropical fruit flavors are actually really good. I would eat them like candy if I had them around all the time. The white ones are my favorites, not sure what flavor it's supposed to be but it's damn good.
