[7:50pm] waynesville: oh! hi john!  

[7:51pm] waynesville: this is pretty cool we can talk without interupting scott  

[7:52pm] johnca: yeah, but everyone in the room can follow the conversation (it's on screens here)  

[7:52pm] miker: we'll have to setup a hecklebot for next time  

[7:53pm] waynesville: yeah but they're not looking at the screen. They're looking at Scott  

[7:53pm] NiallKennedy: drinking game with each mention of tags or long tail  

[7:54pm] waynesville: heehee  

[7:55pm] waynesville: hey niall. tag my long tail  

[7:56pm] waynesville: now we just need a firefox extension for automatic tagging while u browse  

[7:56pm] miker: I'm thinking greasemonkey to add the form to anything would be a good idea  

[7:56pm] NiallKennedy: already exists  

[7:56pm] NiallKennedy: Yahoo! has it  

[7:57pm] miker: but I just saw this for the first time today, so I haven't tried it out at all

[8:01pm] NiallKennedy: Outline Processor Markup Language  

[8:02pm] miker: Nonsense! :-)  

[8:02pm] waynesville: hmm i can't read that blog post and follow mr Scott  

[8:02pm] waynesville: at the same time  

[8:02pm] NiallKennedy: [http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/RelTag](http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/RelTag)  

[8:02pm] NiallKennedy: (existing tag work)  

[8:03pm] JeffClavier: Loomia still stealth :-)  

[8:04pm] waynesville: whoops he just un-stealthed them  

[8:05pm] NiallKennedy: [http://www.loomia.com/](http://www.loomia.com/)  

[8:06pm] waynesville: It looks like the website is just some copy  

[8:07pm] JeffClavier: some copy of ?  

[8:07pm] waynesville: i meant text.  

[8:07pm] waynesville: e.g. salescopy  

[8:07pm] waynesville: sorry overloaded word definition  

[8:08pm] JeffClavier: I never lie, I only exagerate :-P exagerate :-P  

[8:10pm] waynesville: Quote of the day. "It's information inefficiency that turns out to drive things" -- Scott Rafer  

[8:11pm] waynesville: oh god daya talks about myspace every day...  

[8:12pm] waynesville: serendipity  

[8:12pm] waynesville: there's a firefox extension called serendipity  

[8:13pm] waynesville: i wonder what it'll give me if i go to feedster  

[8:13pm] johnca: ObLanka: "serendipity" comes from Serendib, an old Arab name for Sri Lanka  

[8:13pm] waynesville: oh, sorry, it's called StumbleUpon, not serendipity.  

[8:13pm] waynesville: realy? i did not know that  

[8:13pm] NiallKennedy: Pinpoint  

[8:13pm] johnca: I haven't been on this chat from the beginning, and someone asked that this chat get captured and posted to the mailing list. Will someone do that?  

[8:14pm] miker: I've been on since the start, I'll grab it and post  

[8:14pm] waynesville: I wasn't here from the beginning either  

[8:14pm] waynesville: cool thanks miker  

[8:21pm] johnca: [http://peerflix.net/](http://peerflix.net/)  

[8:21pm] markfinnern: [http://www.peerflix.com/](http://www.peerflix.com/)  

[8:22pm] waynesville: peerflix looks like mediachest  

[8:23pm] waynesville: hmm no peerflix is different  

[8:23pm] johnca: howso?  

[8:23pm] waynesville: with mediachest you have to return DVDs. It's like checking DVDs out of a library.  

[8:24pm] waynesville: Only the "library" is someone else on the internet  

[8:24pm] waynesville: whereas peerflix just moves a pool of DVDs around to whoever wants them  

[8:25pm] waynesville: he's talking about intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation  

[8:26pm] waynesville: e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation)  

[8:26pm] waynesville: people who can make money from a personal passion are very lucky  

[8:27pm] johnca: Punished By Rewards, Alfie Kohn (excellent book re intrinsic motivation)  

[8:27pm] NiallKennedy: when is the talk going to come back to smart agents?  

[8:28pm] waynesville: The Chinese WILL figure out a way to control information flow.  

[8:28pm] waynesville: Just watch.  

[8:29pm] johnca: And then the Chinese will figure out how to circumvent that control. Neh?  

[8:29pm] johnca: (and then control will be exerted again, etc.)  

[8:30pm] johnca: or more seriously, what makes you think that battle will be "won" by those who wish to control?  

[8:31pm] johnca: [http://sciencecommons.org/](http://sciencecommons.org/)  

[8:31pm] JeffClavier_ joined the chat room.  

[8:31pm] markfinnern: Science Commons: [http://science.creativecommons.org/](http://science.creativecommons.org/)  

[8:32pm] waynesville: I thought the Chinese would not be able to control information flow on the internet, but they've proven me wrong (so far).  

[8:32pm] bobcat62 joined the chat room.  

[8:32pm] waynesville: So now my expectation is they will continue to prove me wrong  

[8:39pm] johnca left the chat room.  

[8:40pm] johnca joined the chat room.

[8:48pm] waynesville: opt-in? what?  

[8:49pm] miker: copyright. talking about the default state being a copyright for new works  

[8:49pm] waynesville: Oh, opt-in to copyright  

[8:49pm] waynesville: I get it now  

[8:49pm] waynesville: I didn't understand the question when he first asked but I get it now  

[8:50pm] NiallKennedy: oooh, politics now

[8:54pm] waynesville: video.google.com  

[8:58pm] waynesville: I never thought I'd hear Mike Korns say "currency is not useful"  

[8:58pm] waynesville: Ahhh -- "IF information can provide food and shelter". That will never happen.  

[9:00pm] johnca: people lived that way for millions of years, why not?  

[9:00pm] waynesville: Because information != energy. Food is energy.
