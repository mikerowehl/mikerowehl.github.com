[Diego](http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/)'s brother is in town, and he brought with him many treats composed primarily of [dulce de leche](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche). Don't worry if you can't read spanish, neither can I. But here's a rough translation for dulce de leche: really fucking good. It's kinda like caramel, but not quite. Kinda got a frosting-ish/pudding-ish consistency sorta. It's one of those things you apparently just have to experience to understand. If someone offers you something and mentions dulce de leche, take it. It'll send you straight into diabetic coma, but it's worth it.
