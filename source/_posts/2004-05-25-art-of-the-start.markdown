I've registered myself for [The Art of the Start](http://www.artofthestart.com/), a day long event by [Garage Technology Ventures](http://www.garage.com/) focused on educating entrepreneurs about successfully starting a company. A friend pointed out that if you're an [SDForum](http://www.sdforum.org) member you can get fifty dollars off on the registration. You just need to call up SDForum and get the promotion code to use, they have info on the [Special Offers](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/Level1.aspx?pid=10080&sid=7) page. If you're planning to be over there, drop me a line and we'll meet up. I have a feeling I'll be somewhat out of my element, but that's fine.  That's why I'm going after all. I would eventually like to start up an entrepreneurial venture of my own and I know there's a lot I still don't know. Even though I've technically only been consulting on my own for a few months, I've met some very interesting people and run across some great ideas. It takes a whole lot more than just a good idea to start up a successful company however. Some people seem to be able to do it without thinking, others have to work at it to be able to see all the angles. I know I'm in the latter category. I'm just trying to front load as much of the work as I can, so that I'm not learning everything on the job later on.
