There's a [post over at Future Now](http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/000525.html) with a pointer to a new paper titled [Infrastructure for the New Geography](http://blogger.iftf.org/Future/SR-869_Infrastructure_New_Geog.pdf) (PDF). I think it does a great job of laying down some of the possible benefits of having geographic data available. Not just being able to include information about where a photo was taken when you upload it to your album, but having a general geographic search engine that operates in the way that Google or Yahoo do for text content. Sorry for the short post, but I didn't want to let this one slip by, it's definitely worth the time. Go read it. NOW! Git goin'.
