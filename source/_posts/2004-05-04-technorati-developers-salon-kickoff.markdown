Technorati is hosting a [Developers Salon Kickoff](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000347.html) in San Francisco on May 19th. Although it's called a "developers salon", it sounds more like an open invitation to both users and developers to come and talk to the team. I'm going cause it's an interesting tool. I like Technorati, but I haven't used any of the [development interfaces](http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/) yet. It's normally a good move from the innovative technology standpoint as well. If you have a product or service that does something genuinely new, something that hasn't been tried before, it's good to take your developers and your users and partners, get them in the same room, and see what happens. The results can be quite surprising. So, I'm planning to go to observe the interaction as well.
