Gordon Bell is [going to be speaking in Palo Alto on Feb 19th at 7PM](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1299&mo=2&yr=2004). The topic seems to be a wonderfully geeky melange of old ideas with new implications and forward looking applications. I'm gonna have to watch Lain a few more times before I go to this one. Anything that feels it can invoke the name [Vannevar Bush](http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/bush.html) without trying to joke about it is at least worth a look. Plus [Gordon Bell](http://research.microsoft.com/users/gbell/) is no lightweight either. I would think it would be worthwhile to hear him speak, but that's what I thought last month about [going to see Whitfield Diffie](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=122), and I was really wrong about that. So this time I'm not going to make any speculations. I'm going to see the presentation and I hope it's good. There will definitely be bloggage from me no matter what.
