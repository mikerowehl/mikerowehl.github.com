Dave McClure asked [imagine for just a moment that you're Ballmer, Semel, or Schmidt and you've got a couple billion burning a hole in your pocket-- what companies would you put on your shopping list?](http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2005/02/consolidation_2.html). Interesting question. I would probably pick a ton of mobile companies. [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com), [Buzznet](http://www.buzznet.com), [WirelessInk](http://www.wirelessink.com), [LifeBlog](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,54630,00.html), [Audioblog](http://www.audioblog.com/), [WaveMarket](http://www.wavemarket.com/), and the list would go on for a while. And that's just the first wave of services pretty much, looking to mobilize the existing practice of blogging. There are companies like [Caterpillar Mobile](http://www.caterpillarmobile.com/) looking to evolve the models that started in the desktop-centric world into something more suited to personal devices situated in a larger environment. One or two billion dollars would sure get you a long way, but I'm not sure it would make it to complete buyout of the sector.
