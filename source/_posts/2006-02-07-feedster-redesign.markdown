I just saw the new look at [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com), very nice! The search results are much much snappier than I can remember them being for a good long while. Some folks are complaining about [a lack of new features](http://www.makeyougohmm.com/?p=2926), but I read [the entry about the release](http://www.feedster.com/blog/2006/02/06/new-feedster-sitenew-features/) as saying "New site, new features coming soon". Personally I would rather just have a site that works for search than a feature rich site that sometimes tells me the load is too high. Cause you know when I'm really gonna want those results? When there's a news event, during which the load is normally high.
