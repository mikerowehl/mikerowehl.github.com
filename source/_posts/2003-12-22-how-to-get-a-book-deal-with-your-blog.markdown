Biz has [a new article up at Blogger.com](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=674&topic=-1) about how to get a book deal with your blog. It's a great tongue in cheek article that makes for an amusing read, yet brings up some really relevant points at the same time. According to [Biz](http://www.bizstone.com/) he doesn't have a real job function at Blogger.com. Hopefully that means he'll have plenty of time to write stuff like that.
