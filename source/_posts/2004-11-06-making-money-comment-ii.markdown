Another point brought up during the [BloggerCon](http://www.bloggercon.org) Making Money session was that there are plenty of ways to make money using a blog that have nothing to do with trying to monetize the content directly. There are ways to connect with others and form a collective to do something new, trying to gather together the couple of people from all over the world who have the same kind of passion as yourself and the same ideas. Sure, a blog can be used in the same way that a newspaper or magazine is, as an alternative form of journalism. But that's not the only model for use. There are some great oportunities to form new connections, managing new relationships, and facilitate discussion using blogs. It's a way to use your blog while making money instead of using your blog to make money. Alternative models like this probably make a lot of sense instead of always looking at the content based model.
