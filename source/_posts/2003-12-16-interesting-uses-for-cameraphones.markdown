There's [an article over at picturephoning.com](http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/cat_picturephoning_2003_the_year_in_review.htm) listing lots of interesting applications involving cameraphones. This is the kind of stuff that cellular providers should be showing in their ads. And I'm sure there's more intersting stuff on the way, such as [the SENT show](http://www.sentonline.com/index.html) scheduled to open up 2004. I had very high hopes for [BlueHereNow](http://www.phrint.com/blueherenow/benews/index.php), but the updates there seem to be relatively few and far between these days. At least [TextAmerica](http://www.textamerica.com/) has been rolling along at a great pace. They've done a great job.
