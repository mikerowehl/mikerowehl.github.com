I ended up at [an article about content management predictions for 2004](http://www.marketingprofs.com/4/mcgovern22.asp). I really don't have a strong feeling about that article at all, but [the overall site, MarketingProfs.com](http://www.marketingprofs.com/), seems like a great resource for the independent businessperson in general. I've only skimmed a few of the articles so far, but in general it looks quite promising.
