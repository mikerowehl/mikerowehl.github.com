There's [an article at Mercury News](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/7659999.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp) about Motorola licensing the tracking technology that Wheels of Zeus has been working on. I wrote about WoZ in [a recent entry here](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=79). What I found interesting about the article in Mercury News was that Wozniak would like to see this deployed more as a standalone system rather than getting it hooked into other information networks. I think I could see why he's positioned that way, given what I've heard about wOzNET being focused on preventing issues with missing children. But it also could remove it from the playing field of location based services in general, and could leave some significant value on the table for others to snap up.
