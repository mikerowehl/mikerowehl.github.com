There's a [discussion of Creative Commons and some arguments against it](http://www.livejournal.com/users/zestyping/36000.html) that Lessig [wrote about in his blog](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001747.shtml). The discussion about Creative Commons itself is interesting. I come down very strongly on the "CC is good" side of the discussion. Some of the cypherpunks seem to be arguing that CC is bad because it encourages people to be ignorant of copyright law. I think this argument is completely flawed. As brought up in the dicussions there, reusing a license is comparable to reusing a cryptosystem. It is nice when people userstand what they're working with. But just because people should understand how their computer works we don't recommend they write their own operating system and then use it regularly, nor do we expect them to reimplement SSL every time they have an online transaction to carry out online. Why should they learn copyright law and licensing in order to release something to the public?
