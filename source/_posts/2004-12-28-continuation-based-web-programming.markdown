There's a [great article on continuation based web programming in general](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-contin.html) over at DeveloperWorks. I [fooled around with Scheme based modal web programming](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=241) earlier this year, and the model itself was really compelling. It's nice to see an example given using popular web framework technologies.
