![Mountain Dew Pitch Black II](http://static.flickr.com/24/43677366_4bd96b30f5_o_d.jpg)



I think he has a bright future. I figured it had more caffeine than regular Dew, but [that doesn't appear to be the case](http://www.pepsi.com/pepsi_brands/ingredient_facts/index.php). 36mg each. Check out that MDX though, 47. I need a source for that junk. I would probably have to go to some seedy neighborhood and buy it from a guy in a broken down Impalla. I think I would do it though.





Seriously, this stuff is pretty good. I drink a decent amount of Mountain Dew, and the little twist they put on PBII meets with my approval. I wouldn't recommend picking up a few cases without sampling it first. But that's what we did and it turned out okay.
