When I connected to [WINKsite](http://winksite.com/) this morning I noticed the [link to the mobile version of BoingBoing](http://winksite.com/boingboing/mobile) in featured sites area. Woohoo!!! I don't think it's any secret that I'm a WINKsite fan, and I think almost everyone in Silicon Valley reads the standard edition of [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/). It's one of those sites that serves as a hub for bloggers, pulling articles in from all over which other people pick and choose from to mention in their own blogs. I've mentioned WINKsite before, but for those who might be new readers the brief recap:

[WINKsite](http://winksite.com) is a site which allows you to setup mobile websites. There are a bunch of functions you can setup in your site, arranged as modules you can turn on and off. When you sign up you get the url to your site, something like http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope, that you can use with a desktop system or from a mobile device like a cell phone or PDA. That's one of the parts that I think rocks, that you can access the same content from both desktop and mobile. The desktop edition displays using an emulated phone interface so that you can see what it will look like on an actual device. There are two different major interfaces to your site. The first is the interface you see in the emulator or on an actual device, and then there's the admin interface. If you login directly at WINKsite you can perform actions like turning on or off modules. Depending on the modules you have turned on and off the site can serve a number of different purposes. It could be just a simple set of bookmarks you want to keep for yourself, just a pure personal site. Or you could turn on the notes and guestbook functions and use it to communicate with a group of friends. WINKsite also provides more powerful publishing features, including a blogging interface and feed syndication, so that you can create a larger community site providing news and updates.

This is the kind of site that [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net) has setup, it's a reformatted version of the feed from their site along with some community aspects like surveys, guestbook, and chat. I'm curious to see if the BoingBoing site ends up with a lot of draw, and how much the added features get used. I think they have the kind of readership that will really explore the use of new interaction patterns that a site like this allows. Okay, I admit it, I'm a geek. I'm interested in the experiment.
