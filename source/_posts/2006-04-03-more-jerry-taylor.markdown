Some [additional info about the politician who incorrectly threatened CentOS with FBI action](http://www.tuttletimes.com/siteSearch/apstorysection/local_story_088201244.html). Gotta love this:



> “This is just a bunch of freaks out there that don’t have anything better to do,” he said. “When I came in to work Monday morning, I had about 500 e-mails, plus anonymous phone calls from all the geeks out there. [CentOS is] a free operating system that this guy gives away, which tells you how much time he’s got on his hands.”



Nice, very nice. Unfortunately we can't all resort to threats and scare tactics to get our work done for us. Or can we....?
