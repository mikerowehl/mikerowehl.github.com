Eric Rice as proposed the first [LobbyCon](http://www.socialtext.net/m2m/index.cgi?lobbycon), to be held [tomorrow night (August 12th) at 7:30pm in the W Hotel lobby in San Francisco](http://eric.blognews.com/blog/_archives/2004/7/29/114849.html). I guess I've been hacking too much, cause I almost missed this. Sean Bonner [posted the initial idea as LobbyCon](http://www.seanbonner.com/blog/archives/000692.php#000692) after BlogOn. I had much the same impression of BlogOn as Sean did, and we spoke about it afterward at the dinner. We have all the tools at our disposal to organize a somewhat ad-hoc conference, providing many of the advantages that we currently get from the larger events. I think it sounds like an excellent idea, but I'm normally told that my guerrilla style events just wouldn't work. I would love for that to be wrong, so I'm going to the event tomorrow night to try to contribute what I can. Hope to see some of you there.
