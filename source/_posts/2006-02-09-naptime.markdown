I frequently tell people that I can sleep just about anywhere if I'm tired enough, they don't believe me. We have a lot going on at Ning, so I've had a few chances to exercise that ability in the last few days. Diego snapped a pic of me sleeping in my chair with people wandering around:

Not a fantastic nap, but it gets the job done. I'm thinking about trying out that [crazy ass polyphasic sleep thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep) where you only sleep 3 or 4 hours a day in short naps. I'm only sleeping four hours a day as it is, if there's a way to make it more effective might as well give it a try, right? And no, the 4 hours of sleep a day has [nothing to do with the coffee](http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=601). It started way before then. It's insomnia. I'm usually up all night thinking about coffee.
