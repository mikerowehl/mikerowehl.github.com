I was sad to see that Niall [thought that the Feedster contest didn't go well](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2004/12/feedster_contes.html), especially because I've just recently [joined Feedster myself](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=372). If his sentiment is shared by a lot of others I would like to hear about it. Email me at mrowehl at feedster dot com if you want to gripe.
