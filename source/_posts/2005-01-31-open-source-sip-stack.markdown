I was just digging through some old news I marked down but never read, and just noticed the [release of an open-source, reference SIP stack that engineers can tap when developing VoIP and other SIP-enabled equipment designs](http://www.commsdesign.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57700230). The effort seems to be progressing through an organization called [SIPfoundry](http://www.sipfoundry.org/). Here's an excerpt from their mission statement:




> The mission of SIPfoundry is to promote and advance SIP-related Open Source projects. Through SIPfoundry the users, developers, and distributors of SIP based products can collectively support each other and accelerate the growth and adoption of SIP.




I've [mentioned SIP before](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=329), and I'm still pretty excited about what SIP could do in the mobile environment - if it made it out into more implementations. However, I haven't seen it out in the wild yet. Hopefully that's just because it takes time to deploy a new capability and not because there is interest in keeping it out of the public marketplace.
