I forget how I ended up there, but I was reading Michael Sippey's post [about keeping a timeline of major events for the year](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/03/timeline.html). There's [an example at his site](http://www.sippey.com/timeline/). I like it. There should be tools to handle these formats for the Palm platform. Open source tools. When I run across an iCal file online I should be able to add it DIRECTLY to my Palm, not just setup a desktop app that can sync it over. Ditto for RSS and Atom feeds. There should be an open source datebook app that supports calendar layering. And a feed reader. At the minimum. There should be a full Atom interface application, but a feed reader would be a nice start.
