In preparation for [the mobile geekout tonight](http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/momo-tech-gathering.html) I finally got around to installing and mucking around with [Python for the Series 60](http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,034-821,00.html). I haven't had time to really explore the boundaries yet, but what I have played with has been fantastic. Check out the [Python for Series 60 wiki page](http://www.postneo.com/postwiki/moin.cgi/PythonForSeries60) for more info. I took the Bluetooth GPS example there to fool around with. I put up [a version of the code with indentation preserved](http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/series60_python/bluetooth_samples_1.txt).  I'll post more about it as I play around some. Like some info about the remote console over Bluetooth. In my estimation this beats their halfassed C++ environment and simulator. That simulator just keeps pissing me off. Every time I think I have it working something else goes wrong.
