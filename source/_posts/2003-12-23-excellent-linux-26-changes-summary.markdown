There's a great document titled [The Wonderful World of Linux 2.6](http://www.kniggit.net/wwol26.html) that I just got finished reading over. An excellent summary of all the things to look for (and to look out for) in the new kernel release. I've been running the 2.6test series for a while and I've had good luck with it so far. Tonight I'm about to upgrade myself to the official 2.6 release. What I would really like to do is find the time to play around with the embedded Linux changes. At one point I did get Linux running on my girlfriends old Handspring, using the [uCLinux port with the palm loader](http://palm-linux.sourceforge.net/). And I dug around for a while and found the old version of xcopilot in the uCLinux repository and played with that. But I never had enough time to really get into learning about the uCLinux specific stuff. Now that the core kernel has options to support all of those changes, I really have to dedicate some time to learning about them.
