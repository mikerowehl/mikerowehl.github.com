Chris pointed me to an interview today, and I downloaded the MP3 and tossed it onto my Shuffle almost without thinking about it. Why was I able to do this action naturally and in the manner I choose?  Without switching off my main desktop machine?  Because the 0.98rc1 release of [GNUpod](http://www.blinkenlights.ch/cgi-bin/fm.pl?get=ipode) includes the necessary changes to support the iPod Shuffle. It was crippled for a while, and I had to use this attrocious bag of drivers misnamed an operating system in order to do so. But now I can download audio when I want and put them on my device using the programs I choose to. Yay! Thank you GNUpod authors, you rock!
