There's an excellent [article at Innovation Tools](http://www.innovationtools.com/Articles/ArticleDetails.asp?a=113) about methods used to capture ideas when they come to you. I think that most of the Palm based tools for capturing ideas are pretty underdeveloped. A while ago I was considering writing a Palm app to do something like the mind map described in the article (although at the time I didn't know it was called a mind map). Now that I've read the article, it sounds like it might make a good app for the pilot. Especially the Clie and OS5 devices with larger screens. I normally carry my PDA around with me to jot down little ideas. But when I don't have it with me, I SMS a message to my email address (my provider has a SMS to email gateway).
