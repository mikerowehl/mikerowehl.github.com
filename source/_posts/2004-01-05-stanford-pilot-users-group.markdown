The [Stanford Palm Users Group](http://www.rahul.net/flasheridn/spug/) meets on the first Tuesday of each month, the next meeting is Jan 6th 2004. The page for it isn't regularly updated, but the group is alive. I know a lot of you probably got cool new toys to play with this holiday. Come on out and talk about the cool stuff you want to get them to do.
