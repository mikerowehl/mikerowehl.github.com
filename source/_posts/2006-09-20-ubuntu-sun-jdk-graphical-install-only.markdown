I was just installing the Sun JDK on my workstation at the office, and when I tried the obvious: apt-get install sun-java5-bin got an error message about not being able to find a license. Interesting, thought I, "there must be a higher level package wrappering this whole thing that deposits a license file somewhere for the apt-get process to pick up". A bunch  of searching around in the repository listings turned up no java license related packages.

You find where [download mp3 music](http://www.aspma.com/downloads/) on player, You need [mp3 music download](http://www.aspma.com/download/) from online mp3 archive

So I did a search and ended up with [this description of installing Java under Ubuntu](https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/ubuntu.html) which says pretty much what I was doing, except using the graphical package manager instead. "How lame would it be if you needed to install Java using the Synaptic package manager instead of the command line?" Not lame enough to discourage doing it apparently. If you're looking to install Java under Ubuntu you might have to use the package manager instead of apt-get in order to do it. Next time you see Java people throw rotten fruit at them to let them know how you feel about that.
