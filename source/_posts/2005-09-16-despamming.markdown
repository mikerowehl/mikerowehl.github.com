I had a spam comment [to this post](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=453) that I just had to approve so that everyone could see it. I have no idea what to make of it. It's either funny, or sad, or scary.... Maybe all three. Is the person really tired of their job and just fooling around?  Is this the spammer equivalent of watching [Strongbad](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html) while at work? Or is it an attempt to make the spam appear more valid?  The link to a Yahoo profile is a nice touch. It provides a redirection for the links, the same way that the spam blogs on Blogger do. And it provides these traits:







  * Age: 26


  * Marital Status: Single


  * Sex: Female


  * Occupation: Free as bird





Pretty much ensuring that the bored geeks trawling through the Yahoo profiles will click on it. If it were me I would include a stock image of some random cute girl just so that the link in the list of profiles will appear with the little camera icon next to it. But otherwise it's just about perfect.
