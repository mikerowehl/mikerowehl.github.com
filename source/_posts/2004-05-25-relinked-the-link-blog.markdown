I've added a link to the [link blog](http://www.bitsplitter.net/linkblog/) up at the top of the standard view of this blog. I've been using it quite a bit again, cause it's a convenient way to keep track of stuff I want to read without bookmarking it at whatever computer I happen to be at (probably not the same computer that I'll be at later when I want to retrieve that bookmark). My link blog has the extra attribute of concentrating on links which render well on small screens - the stuff I chuck there is meant to be pulled up on my Palm for later reading. It's actually a pretty decent set of reading in small-screen-friendly format.
