I'm going to be out of town till Tuesday some time, I think I forgot to mention that. I might post every once in a while, but in general it'll probably be a few days before I really have a chance to comment. I'm visiting with some people while I'm out here, so hopefully I'll have some juicy new info and be able to make a few interesting posts.
