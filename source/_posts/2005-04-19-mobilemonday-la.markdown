The [first Mobile Monday down in LA](http://mobilitee.org/archives/31) happened last night! Looks like a great turnout, better than we did for our first event up in San Francisco! Marc Brown has some [images in his moblog as well](http://marc.buzznet.com/user/). Congratulations to Tomo Software and Buzznet on a job well done! If you're interested in the events it looks like there's another one coming up on May 16th. Keep an eye on [their site](http://www.mobilemonday.la/). It needs a feed guys!
