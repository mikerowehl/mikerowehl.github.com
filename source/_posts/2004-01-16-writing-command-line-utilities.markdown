There's [an article at IBM DeveloperWorks](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-util.html?ca=dgr-lnxw06ArtWriting) about writing reusable command line utilities. The article focuses on five guidelines:




  * Do one thing well.

  * Be a filter.

  * Generalize.

  * Be robust.

  * Be new.


The article goes into some detail about each of those areas. The resources section lists _The UNIX Programming Environment_, and I would strongly recommend [_The Practice of Programming_](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/index.html). For any level of progammer, beginner through expert, I think TPOP has something to offer.
