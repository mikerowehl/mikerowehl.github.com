A [post at Emergic](http://www.emergic.org/archives/2004/02/05/index.html#vc_term_sheet) pointed me to an [explanation of terms used by venture capitalists when funding a company](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/29/TermsheetBounce). I've been at lots of startup companies in the past, and been through the funding process, but I've never been in on the terms negotiation. From the little bit I do know, this looks like a simple yet informative overview of what the terms really mean.
