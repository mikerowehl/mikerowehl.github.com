I've put up a 1.1 release of PalmTorrent at [the SourceForge site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpalmenv/). The app is just a simple application/database downloader for the Palm OS environment. It'll download a file over HTTP and give the option of installing it directly onto the handheld, basically providing a way to get content onto your PDA without having to go back to your PC. Just a bunch of minor updates really, save and restore the  URL field, get rid of buttons for functions that aren't implemented, stuff like that. The raw .prc file is at Bitsplitter also, at [http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc](http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/ptorrent-1.1.prc) if you would rather have a URL that you can use directly.
