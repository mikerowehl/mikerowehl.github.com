Paul Saffo is [going to be speaking in Palo Alto](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1269) on January 15th. I've read a few essays by Paul that I was impressed by, in particular his [Failure is the Best Medicine](http://www.saffo.com/failure_best_medicine.html) piece from last year. This speech is supposed to focus on the role of media in the recent bubble increase and I guess maybe bursting. His point seems to be that the whole issue is media, and that computing and technology are just playing supporting roles. Could be interesting. I've put in my registration.
