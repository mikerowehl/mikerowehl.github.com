I've been using [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) to follow the [Gnomedex](http://www.gnomedex.com) comments, but that info seems to be pretty lagged. And Gnomedex has a [submit info page](http://www.lockergnome.com/contact/submissions.phtml) but they some some stuff about making decisions to publish stuff. So I'm assuming that isn't realtime either. So here's a post to either leave pointers to your resources, or submit trackbacks.  We have an IRC channel going on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net), channel #gnomedex. Here's some of the stuff people in IRC have posted:




  * [Attendee Links](http://my.yahoo.com/s/gnomedex.html)


  * [Peter Kaminski's Pics](http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterkaminski/sets/16646/)


  * [Phil Morrison's Pics](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pjmorr)


If you have something submit a trackback here or add it in a comment.
