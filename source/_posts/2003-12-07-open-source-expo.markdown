For those of you in the Bay Area, there's an [Open Source Expo](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1260&mo=12&yr=2003) at the San Francisco Airport Marriott this Thursday (that's Dec 11, 2003). It's pretty cheap considering the speakers they have lined up. And I'm very happy to see that they have both technical and business tracks. I'm definitely interested in the business track, so that's where I'll probably be. Topics include "New Business Models" and "Marketing and Selling OSS Effectively", two topics that sound great now that Bitsplitter is really starting to ramp up. Speakers from IBM, RedHat, MySQL, Sleepycat, HP, and elsewhere. Looks like it could be an excellent event.
