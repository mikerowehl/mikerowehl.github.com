[According to SmartMobs](http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/002983.html) there's a fundraiser in San Francisco for a new organization called [Public Knowledge](http://www.publicknowledge.org/). They seem to be into some interesting stuff. This is from their about page on their website:


> Public Knowledge is a new public-interest advocacy organization dedicated to fortifying and defending a vibrant information commons. This Washington, D.C. based group works with wide spectrum of stakeholders - libraries, educators, scientists, artists, musicians, journalists, consumers, software programmers, civic groups and enlightened businesses - to promote the core conviction that some fundamental democratic principles and cultural values - openness, access, and the capacity to create and compete - must be given new embodiment in the digital age.


I'm one of them software programmer people, I'm registered. Maybe I'll see some of you there.
