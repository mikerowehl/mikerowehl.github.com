It's official now, I've tested out the 1.4 release of [Vagablog](http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/) to post to a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blog and it works perfect. Even the title and category work (although the category must be specified numerically). I'm considering adding in support for the b2 version of getCategories before I make it through the 2.0 release. WordPress is a great tool, and now that I'm using it for my own blog I'm very strongly motivated to tweek for it.
