title: Earthquake RSS

I was sitting at the office and thought I felt the building shaking. It might have been a truck, or the building settling, or an earthquake. So I went over to the [USGS earthquake maps](http://quake.usgs.gov/recenteqs/latest.htm), a very cool resource. Must  have been something other than an earthquake, but I still thought "Hey, this would be a great thing to have as RSS." Apparently someone else thought so a while ago, cause you can find the feeds [here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/rss.html).
