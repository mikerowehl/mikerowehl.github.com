title: SpellBound Firefox Plugin, Dev Version
---

Apparently Firefox 2 has inline spellcheck right out of the box.  Werd, I'm looking forward to it.  However, my Ubuntu systems still have Firefox 1.5.x and I don't want to start mucking around now that I've just started accepting I don't need to build everything by hand. Start pulling on that thread again and whole thing comes apart!

Normally I use a plugin for spell checking, but it stopped working a few updates ago. Firefox or the extension claims that they are no longer friends. So I was very happy to find the [development preview](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=351130) of SpellBound, which not only works with the current Firefox releases under Ubuntu, but does inline spellcheck. Double w00t to that one.  I have it installed at home, as long as it doesn't cause any problems I'll put it in here at work too.
