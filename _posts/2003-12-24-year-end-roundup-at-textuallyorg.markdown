title: Year End Roundup at textually.org
---

There's [an entry at textually.org](http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/002665.htm) linking together the 10 year end  posts. I've been reading the info at textually and picturephoning on a regular basis, they have great coverage. This year end summary provides a great opportunity to spin through the top items of the year and review ones I was too busy to dig into the first time around. Thank you for the summary, and thank you for providing excellent news year round!
