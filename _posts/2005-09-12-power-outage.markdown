I was going to post earlier, but [apparently a lot of Los Angeles was without power today](http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-09-12-voa60.cfm) and my hosting provider was in an affected area. I realized my mail client was complaining about dropped connections, so I checked and my site was down, so then I went to file a trouble ticket and realized their site was down, so then I went to the offsite status page and found a link to that story. When I saw the reference to al-Qaida in the story I joked to a co-worker that one should never attribute to malice that which can as easily be explained by incompetence. Looks like I was right: "It began after workers installing system upgrades incorrectly cut several cables and stretched from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific coast and north into the San Fernando Valley. Neighboring cities connected to the LADWP's power supply also were affected."
