On February 15th starting at 6pm is a Future Salon event titled [Future of Art and Technology](http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/02/future_of_art_.html). I'm not really familiar with any of the efforts or organizations listed there, so I'm going to learn about the stuff. For a while I've been thinking about hooking together biofeedback systems with the electronics commonly found at live events, spurred somewhat by reading [The Diamond Age](http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/thediamondage.html) by Stephenson a while ago. It's the merger of art, technology, and social systems like that which really gets my interest up. That's one of the aspects that draws me to [mobility](http://www.mobilemonday.us), and technologies like [mesh networking](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html), [TinyOS](http://www.tinyos.net/), and [hacking RFID to do more interesting stuff than it's deployed to do](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/29/0321219&tid=158&tid=172). When you allow the dialog of creation that the artist and audience engage in to compress to a realtime exchange (when the feedback loop is closed and direct) I think a state change happens. It's a lot like the change in communication styles that happen between asyncronous and syncronous dialog everywhere else.
