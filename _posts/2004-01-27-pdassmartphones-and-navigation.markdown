title: PDAs/Smartphones and Navigation
---

Elle posted a [pointer to some information about smartphone and handheld trends in Europe](http://www.proteanstrategy.com/wordpress/index.php?p=71&c=1). The information mentions the role of navigation packages, particularly GPS based services, in the increased adoption of devices. I would certainly like to get my hands on a device or two with geolocation capabilities. I think a few simple PDA apps to hook up to [GeoURL](http://www.geourl.org/) or Atom/RSS feed software with mapping capability could spawn a couple of really interesting new usage patterns. I'll have to keep my eye on some used Bluetooth GPS gear or something. I am personally of the opinion that geolocation services in one form or another are going to play a big role in mobile services in general, I think navigation systems are just the tip of the iceberg.
