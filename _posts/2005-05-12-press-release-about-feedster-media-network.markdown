title: Press Release about Feedster Media Network
---

A [press release went out about the Feedster Media Network](http://feedster.blogs.com/corporate/2005/05/feedsters_media.html) today. It's really cool to see an announcement about something I worked on out on the wire. Consulting work didn't see that really happen at all. All in all the announcement is less exciting than the system going live and seeing the ads start appearing in the Slashdot feed. And not nearly as exciting as the system proving to be up to the task of serving traffic from a publisher with a reputation for commanding huge amounts of traffic. Kinda quaint to have a press release about a new media advertising system. I suppose somebody reads them though. In relation to the [question I asked before about the role of press releases after a company starts blogging](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=491), put down one tick mark on the "something issued after the discussion has been going on and a solid message has formed" side of the scorecard.
