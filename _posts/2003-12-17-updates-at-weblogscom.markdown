title: Updates at Weblogs.com
---

There's a few news items at weblogs.com, including [an announcement about moving the server to a new location](http://newhome.weblogs.com/2003/12/15#a113).  The service does seem to be a lot quicker, but that could just be subjective. There are also some other items about additional features and problems with some users who seem to be pulling the changes.xml file much more often than they should.  So if you're using weblogs.com changes for some app, check to make sure you're only pulling it infrequently. Once an hour seems to be the guideline.
