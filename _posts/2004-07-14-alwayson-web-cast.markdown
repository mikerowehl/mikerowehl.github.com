title: AlwaysOn Web Cast
---

There's a web cast from [AlwaysOn](http://www.alwayson-network.com/events/index.php) today and tomorrow. There's also an [event wiki](http://www.socialtext.net/m2m/index.cgi) at SocialText. And a few of us have jointed #alwayson on irc.freenode.net instead of using the live chat they have setup.
