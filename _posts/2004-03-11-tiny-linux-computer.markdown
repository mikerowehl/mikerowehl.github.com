title: Tiny Linux Computer
---

An [article over at O'Reilly](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4546) describes the [Gumstix computer](http://www.gumstix.org), a very small ARM based Linux machine. The systems themselves seem to be quite cheap compared to other embedded system development systems. Information on the sites seems to be a bit spotty with relation to how development tools are made available. Maybe it uses a completely stock gcc ARM compiler and instructions for building the cross compiler come with the board, I didn't see that question answered directly in the [FAQ](http://www.gumstix.com/support.html). It is not an open source design, they aren't planning to release schematics for the Gumstix systems. But like the author of the O'Reilly article I think the geolocation applications of a system like this are pretty interesting. Given that it runs on such low power in general, if that power supply can be made to last for a long time it would make a great geologging platform.
