title: Blogging Doomed!!!!
---

Reclusive mobile technology pundit and Internet crackpot Russell Beattie [posted recently about the increasing number of sensationalist posts](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008772.html) out in the bloggosphere. What does it mean? Well I for one think it spells out doom. DOOOM!!!! Doomy doomy doom spreading all over the place. And then a light lunch. Won't someone please think about the children!

Now, let's see if that gets me up on [Digg](http://www.digg.com). Got some name calling, sensationalism. Right, need someone to blame. How about [Evil Bert](http://nate.calc.org/webalbum/fun/images/osama%20bin%20laden%20(bert%20is%20evil)_jpg.jpg)? The [Userfriendly linked in the comments to Russ's post](http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20060124) is hysterical too, check that out.
