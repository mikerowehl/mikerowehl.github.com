title: The Open Palm Environment Project
---

I'm sure lots of people got shiny new Palm devices for whatever winter holiday it is they might celebrate. So I figured this would be a great time to pick back up the Open Palm Environment project. I started out by putting a page up [as the home page at sourceforge](http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/) and embedding a desktop bridge for the [WINKsite](http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope) that I created for it. Hopefully I'll be able to keep working on it for a while, but there are a bunch of other contracting engagements I need to tend to also. I've also started cleaning the cruft out of the application downloader and there should be a build of that ready soon. After that the party invitations should go out, and we'll see what kinda feedback we can get. Until then, feel free to drop by the site, poke around, leave some feedback, explore the little bit of content I have had time to drop in.
