There's an [article at NewScientist.com](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994434) about a new network mapping project called Opte. I had heard about it before, but hadn't seen any images yet. I'm really into mapping projects like this. They're interesting both for the theory and implementation detail that goes into the mapping software, and because they make pretty pictures. I have the [Peacock Maps](http://www.peacockmaps.com) up on the walls of my home office, and my coffee book table is the [Atlas of Cyberspace](http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/atlas.html).
