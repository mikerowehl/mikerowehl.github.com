title: It Has Begun!
---

I [mentioned the other day that I wanted to drink 100 cups of coffee in 48 hours](http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=600). [Diego was down with it](http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003314.html). And we've been [encouraged, insulted, applauded, and dismissed in Russ's comments](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008731.html). It's stupid, it's pointless, it's dangerous... so of course we just have to do it. The challenge has started!! 100 cups of coffee in 48 hours. [Photos getting posted to FLickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker) as the madness unfolds. To those who encouraged us, thanks! To those who said it can't be done.. maybe you're right we'll see. But we're not afraid to try! To those who called us idiots, well, you folks may have a point. But we'll be higly caffeinated idiots, so it's all good.
