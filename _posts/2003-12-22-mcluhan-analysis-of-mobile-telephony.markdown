title: McLuhan Analysis of Mobile Telephony
---

There's a [post about applying McLuhan's "Laws of Media"](http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100229) to the mobile telephone. I hadn't heard of these questions before, and both the article and the discussion around it are very interesting. In the comments there are links to some good sites and papers, so don't read just the article itself.  There's a lot more there.
