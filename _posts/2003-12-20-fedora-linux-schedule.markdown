title: Fedora Linux Schedule
---

There's a [schedule posted at the Fedora site](http://fedora.redhat.com/participate/schedule/). Sure RedHat may have moved it's support to only the enterprize versions, but I still think the Fedora version is going to rock. I just wish I had a test system free so that I could muck around with the new releases and maybe help out some. The release plans for integration of the 2.6 version of the kernel, which I think is very cool. Guess I'll have to wait till it stabilizes some.... aww man.
