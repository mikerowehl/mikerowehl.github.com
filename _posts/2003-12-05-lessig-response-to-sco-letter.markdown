title: Lessig Response to SCO Letter
---

[This entry](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001611.shtml) in the lessig blog presents an analysis of the [open letter](http://www.newsforge.com/trends/03/12/04/2024240.shtml?tid=85) from Darl McBride, CEO of SCO. SCO has been slogging it's way through an inane lawsuit claiming that Linux is based off stolen code that SCO owns the rights to. Like most news, it's kinda funny, mostly sad, and best taken in small doses. Lessig does a great job of making those small doses easy to swallow.
