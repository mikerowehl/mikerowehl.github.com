title: High Speed Photography
---

There  are [images online](http://web.mit.edu/Damonv/Public/Doombolt/) from a couple of people who constructed a high speed photo lab using a BASIC stamp and some off the shelf parts. I have no idea how expensive high speed photography normally is, or just how hard it is to construct one of these, but the pictures are pretty. I think it's also cool they did it for $40, although I'm assuming that doesn't include air compressor, controller, and the various cameras they used. I figured the flash would be the hard part given their description, but it says they just used the flash from a disposable. Mmmmm, impaled fruit.
