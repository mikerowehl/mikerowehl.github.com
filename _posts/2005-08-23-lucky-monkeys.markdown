Apparently monkeys are being [given a new drug to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation](http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=healthNews&storyID=2005-08-23T134543Z_01_SCH349470_RTRIDST_0_HEALTH-SLEEP-DEPRIVATION-DC.XML). And I'm sitting here drinking my Mountain Dew like a sucker. Now I admit it's been a while since I've been to the zoo, but I do see the occasional monkey flick on one of the nature channels. It doesn't seem to me that there would be a real market in monkey stimulants. Except maybe for the big guy, who had tanks and airplanes to contend with while carying a screaming Faye Wray. That looked pretty stressful. I just can't see your average monkey pulling too many 30-36 hour hacking sprees. Now silicon Valley, there's some monkeys who could use "facilitated attentional processes related to speed." It would have come in really handy at [BARcamp](http://barcamp.org) I bet. I say this is unfair discrimination. Why are the monkeys getting all the good drugs first?
