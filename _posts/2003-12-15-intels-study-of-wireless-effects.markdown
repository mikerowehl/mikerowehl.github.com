There's [an article at Network World Fusion](http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/mobile/2003/1208mobile1.html?fsrc=rss-bigfeed) pointing to some information released by Intel about how much wireless has boosted their productivity. Umm.. this is the same Intel that's waist deep in Centrino, its new chipset for wireless that it's been pimping left and right? I find this to be a bit lacking in terms of journalism. Of course Intel says that wireless is cool, and of course if they have supporting data it's nice of them to release it. But I would expect at least a bit of a mention of the fact that the information about wireless productivity gains is being provided by a company with a weighted interest in selling those wireless systems.
