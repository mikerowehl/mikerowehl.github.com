I saw [an article about IETF work on geolocation and presence info](http://www.instantmessagingplanet.com/enterprise/article.php/3305451) linked off O'Reilly. This is very cool, I hadn't heard anything about the [GEOPRIV working group](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/geopriv-charter.html) before, and it could mean that work in general on the subject is a lot further along than I expected it to be. However, work on standards is not a working project. There's still a lot to be done in terms of making a working system, such as getting a good working set of maps. This should prove a very interesting additional point of entry into the subject if nothing else.
