title: Vagablog and TypePad.com

I got a question the other day about using [Vagablog](http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/) to post to [TypePad.com](http://www.typepad.com) hosted blogs. I hadn't tried it before, and it seems to work just fine. I put instructions up on the webpage, and I'll probably be adding typepad.com as an option in the types list, cause I don t think most people would know what to set it to. At least a few of the MetaWeblogAPI methods might get support soon. If for no other reason than to be able to turn on title and category for MovableType sites.
