I ran across the blog [LEMONODOR](http://lemonodor.com/), which has lots of info about the Lisp programming lanauge. Most of it is stuff I imagine I would never run across otherwise, and I have been trying to learn Scheme well enough that I can use [LispME](http://www.lispme.de/lispme/) on my Palm to do small experiements while out and about. For someone with [imperative programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) so deeply ingrained in their unconscious, it's really hard to pick up other styles. My inability to pick up the new style is indicative of me having fallen into a kind of rut in terms of my programming, so now I'm doubly resolved to be able to program effortlessly in Lisp or Scheme.
