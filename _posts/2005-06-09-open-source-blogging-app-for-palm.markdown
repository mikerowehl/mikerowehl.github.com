title: Open Source Blogging App for Palm
---

I pulled all the registration code and have posted [both executable and source code for Vagablog](http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?page_id=7). It's a simple blog posting tool for Palm devices. I'm actually posting this from my 650 to test out the latest build. There's a lot more functionality that should be in there. But you know what they say, release early and often.
