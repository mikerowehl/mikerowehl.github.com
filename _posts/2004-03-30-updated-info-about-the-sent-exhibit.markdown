title: Updated Info About the SENT Exhibit
---

I got a message back from Xeni saying that the SENT site should go live very soon (within about a week) and that the live show is going to happen during the summer. Yay!! Seems like a lot is going on, even if it isn't reflected on the [SENT site](http://www.sentonline.com/). I might actually have to take a trip down to LA.
