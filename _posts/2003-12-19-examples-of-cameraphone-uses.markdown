There's [an article at picturephoning.com](http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/002625.htm) about how some small businesses are using cameraphones to save themselves time and money. Excellent concrete examples to site for certain industries. There's an obvious benefit for contractors, who can snap pictures of trouble spots and either get customer or third party feedback. Great example.
