title: Blogger Team at the San Fran Weblogger Meetup
---

After the horrid turnout of the last [Weblog Meetup](http://blog.meetup.com), I did a little web crawling and emailed the people that I could find who were signed up for the event. The results were great. In particular, Jason Shellen says that he's [getting as much of the Blogger crew as he can](http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2003_12_01_default.asp#107111749278187386) to come out and join the event. Yay!! Thanks Jason. And to the rest of you, I hope to see you there.
