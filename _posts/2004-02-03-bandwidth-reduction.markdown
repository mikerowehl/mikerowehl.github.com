Jon Udell has [a post about the two techniques used to reduce bandwidth when downloading feeds](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/02/01.html#a905). Those examples were pretty cool. I knew there was a header that could be used to check if a site had changed, but I never looked it up before. This is something I should add into [the OPE download tool](http://openpalmenv.sourceforge.net/), presently called PalmTorrent. It would be really cool to have your apps setup so that you could update them online, the way that [SoftwareUpdate](http://softwareupdate.sourceforge.net/) allows for, but running through the whole catalog to see what has been updated.
