title: South by Southwest Transcripts
---

[The South by Southwest Music and Media Conference](http://www.sxsw.com/) is currently going on in Austin TX. I wasn't able to make it, but I've been hanging around in a couple of [Freenode.net](http://www.freenode.net/) IRC channels and listening to the discussions. Fast Company has a [series of transcripts](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/cat_recon_sxsw_2004.html) that they've uploaded to their blog section, and there's a [SocialText Wiki that has chat logs from some sessions](http://www.socialtext.net/sxsw2004/index.cgi?sxsw_interactive_2004). So instead of picking and choosing at this point what I want to comment on, I figured I would leave those resources to provide a bit of an overview of what's going on down there in that most un-Texas of Texan cities.
