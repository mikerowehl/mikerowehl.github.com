Folks came and [visited the Ning office today](http://visiting.ning.com/index.php). And guess who was mysteriously [absent from the group](http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=100178715&size=m)? [Kevin Burton](http://www.feedblog.org/). Apparently we have enough free time that we should be able to host folks whenever they feel like stopping by, but Kevin was just too busy to attend [the meetup he was instrumental in organizing](http://kalsey.com/2006/02/visit_ning/). Burton, come on, we got cupcakes and everything! I almost cried, but it was okay. A bunch of folks from the Facebook showed up, including [Noah](http://www.okdork.com/), who's birthday is this Friday by the way. So if you see him at the TechCrunch BBQ make sure to make him drink a shot in celebration.
