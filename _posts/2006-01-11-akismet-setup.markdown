title: Akismet Setup
---

One of the cooler features of [Wordpress 2.0](http://www.wordpress.org) is supposed to be the [Akismet plugin for spam filtering](http://akismet.com). The last couple of days must have put me on all the spam target lists. I just cleared out about 150 spam comments over the last three hours, and don't really feel like having to do that too often. So I turned on the Akismet plugin to see how that works out. I already had a [Wordpress.com account](http://miker.wordpress.com) (required for the API key), so setup was easy. Take that Cialis hawking freaks!!
