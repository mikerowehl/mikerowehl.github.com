title: Linus Responds to SCO Evidence Files
---

There's [a post over at Groklaw](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031222174158852) with Linus's response to the files that SCO says were coppied. Basically, it looks like bunk. Which is what a lot of us expected. SCO has tried sighting files which are so heavily standardized that any implementation would look the same. But still, there are very telltale mistakes in the Linux version which make it appear that the files were written to try to impement the interfaces by a novice programmer, not coppied from a 20 year old codebase. I hope SCO just gets completely blasted out of the water and we can forget about their annoying charade. If they can't succeed in running their business, they can at least go out with some dignity.
