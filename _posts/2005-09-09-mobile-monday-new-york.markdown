title: Mobile Monday New York
---

It's really exciting to see the idea of Mobile Monday picked up and expanded.  A team out in New York:







  * Eli Chapman


  * Stephen Chang


  * Lubna Dajani


  * David Harper


  * Dan Melinger





is [holding a Mobile Monday event out there on Sept 19th, 2005](http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/09/mobile-monday-new-york.html). In a few years we'll start trading barbs about west coast vs. east coast mobility, and which is more hard core. Then I change my name to M-diddy. I love it when a plan comes together.
