title: Intellectual Property Protections
---

Larry Lessig [gave a presentation on why the protection of IP is important for the creative process](http://trends.newsforge.com/trends/04/03/17/156205.shtml?tid=137&tid=147). It sounds like it was the same set of material that [he tried out on us over at Stanford](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=167). Lessig has a new book on the market called [**The Future of Ideas**](http://the-future-of-ideas.com/), something I'm certainly going to pick up and read. There was a quote I particularly liked in there:


> "Let the commercial interests compete on execution of the ideas; that's the free enterprise system," Lessig said. "But the creators need to maintain the freedom to distribute their ideas any way they want. They shouldn't be bogged down by 20-year copyrights and other old restrictions that bottle up good ideas" [and] keep them on the shelf, Lessig said.


Which reminded me that the mobile publishing site [WINKsite](http://www.winksite.com) has [added support for marking content as covered by Creative Commons licenses](http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?blog_id=1208). So of course I quickly ran out and marked [the Unrooted mobile site](http://winksite.com/Reverend/unrooted) and [the Open Palm Environment mobile site](http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope) as wonderfully liberating [ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/) content. I actually think I might feel another WINKsite coming on... I feel the urge to experiment.
