Most of you have probably heard about [the Enzo Ferrari crash yesterday](http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=109393). Sad sad thing to see such a beautiful car destroyed. If you're feeling like gawking you can check out the [pictures of the crash site here](http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/news/more-on-the-enzo-incident-on-pch-with-photos-156121.php). Fortunately I can also bring you exclusive coverage, one of my friends down in the area snapped a pic of the real Enzo driver as he escaped into the woods:
