There was a [post at Lemonodor](http://lemonodor.com/archives/000718.html) a while ago pointing to the [online version of a book called _Successful Lisp_](http://www.psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/cover.html) which is supposed to come out as a real world book some time soon. The post pointed to content at [Lispmeister.com](http://lispmeister.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/), which looks like another great resource for those looking to learn about Lisp.
