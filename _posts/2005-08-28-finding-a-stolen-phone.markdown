title: Finding a Stolen Phone
---

This was linked off Slashdot, so I'm sure everyone and their grandmother has already seen it, but [here's a story about some folks tracking down a cell phone theif](http://zone-mr.net/?act=entry&id=36). Besides liking the final bit:

It's cool that they found the theif and all, got their phone back. W00t, and so on. But I don't like the idea of people being able to track me due to my actions online. And lots of the current structure of mobile communications enforces a coupling between my identity and my activity online. Not that it has to, it's intentially setup that way to "prevent abuse". <sarcasm>Which works just smashingly!</sarcasm> I don't know, just kinda stuck me weird. I must be spending too much time trawling hacking boards in my quest for a [buffer overflow attack against the PSP browser](http://blog.davidkaspar.com/archives/2005/07/psp_firmware_20_is_out.php).
