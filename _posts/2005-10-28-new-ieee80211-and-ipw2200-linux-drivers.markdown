I've been wandering around a bit lately, so fixing the DHCP problem I had with the ipw2200 drivers under Linux on the Thinkpad was finally a priority. I was about to apply a patch I had a pointer to, when I saw that there are new versions out:







  * [ieee80211](http://ieee80211.sourceforge.net/)


  * [ipw2200](http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/)


  * [new firmware too](http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php)





Nice, now DHCP works with WPA. Lets see now if the driver as a whole is more reliable. :-)
