title: Kernel Config from Thinkpad X32
---

Someone emailed me asking for the config for the kernel I'm running on my X32, so I figured I might as well post it instead of just mailing it back.  I'm using the 2.6.13 drop from [kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org) and adding in [packages like WPA afterward](http://www.rowehl.com/blog/?p=550).  Here's [the config](http://www.rowehl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/config-2.6.13.txt).
