title: Ourmedia Launch
---

I got a note from JD that [Ourmedia is live today](http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/03/ourmedia_is_her.html)! The timing is great. There's a lot of attention going into podcasting and videoblogging, and I think a free platform for sharable and reusable media could potentially help to shift the attention away from traditional broadcast and into the realm of peer-produced content. Elle and I both helped out on the metadata definition parts during the early stages as well as some early testing (I'm [user number 7](http://ourmedia.org/user/7)). The project is meant to provide a place for people to store the media they want to share with others. Some of the most compelling examples I heard were citizen jounalism and politcal ads. They have both [video](http://ourmedia.org/videos) and [audio](http://ourmedia.org/audios) content up, and if you sign up for an account you can upload your own. A lot of the ideas that [Larry Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/blog/) talks about in Free Culture really helped to drive my motivation in paying attention to and helping out with projects like this. Curious what those ideas are?  Check out [a free copy of Free Culture](http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/) or one of the movies explaining the importance of having works out in public and available for reuse.
