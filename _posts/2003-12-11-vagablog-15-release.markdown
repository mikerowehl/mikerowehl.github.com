title: Vagablog 1.5 Release
---

I have the 1.5 release of Vagablog [up on the Vagablog page](http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/). The updates are relatively minor, but it explicitly says that WordPress and Movable Type are supported. And when Movable Type is being used, it hides the extra fields on the main screen. Maybe this will cut down on people misunderstanding Title field. I was hoping that people using the roll-your-own tools would at least skim the setup docs on the web. I should have known better. Now they just shouldn't even be tempted. I'm planning to do the Metaweblog API soon, so that Movable Type does get title support.
