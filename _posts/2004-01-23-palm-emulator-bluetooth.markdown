title: Palm Emulator Bluetooth
---

[This site](http://www.beecon.de/howto/pose_bt/index.html) describes how to use a physical bluetooth device from a POSE session running under Linux. That's just really cool. I with the people actually at Palm would realize the market they lost in open source advocates, but if that isn't going to happen at least a couple of talented people can provide an alternative. Of course, this only works for emulating older devices, Palm doesn't have anything available for Linux to simulate their newest devices. Thank you [BeeCon](http://www.beecon.de/index.html), this is a great tool.
