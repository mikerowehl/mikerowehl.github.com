There's [an article at PalmInfocenter.com](http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=6385) about [PDAPortal.us](http://www.pdaportal.us/). PDAPortal is a collection of sites with content formatted in a way that displays well on PDA screens. Very convenient. I'll have to try using this portal to look for sites instead of using the [scripts I was using to massage content into a format that looked decent in Plucker](http://www.unrooted.net/hacking/palm/plucker-summaries.html). These sites can either be used to suck up for offline viewing or read directly online. I've really had a hard time finding sites that I can view directly from my handheld, so this should be really cool.
