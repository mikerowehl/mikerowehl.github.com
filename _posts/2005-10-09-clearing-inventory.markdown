title: Clearing Inventory
---

Apple is apparently [updating hardware without telling folks so that they can clear inventory](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/08/1743201&from=rss). Interesting. Wonder what happens when the Intel based systems come out?  They just going to get quitly slipped in too?
