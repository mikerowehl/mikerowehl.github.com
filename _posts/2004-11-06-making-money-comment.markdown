During the Making Money session of [BloggerCon](http://www.bloggercon.org), someone told a story about writing a book that ended up selling for $40. And the referral fee paid by Amazon for someone buying the book using a link from his blog ended up being twice the fee paid him by the publisher for each book sold. Interesting.
