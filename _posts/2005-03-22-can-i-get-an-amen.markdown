title: Can I Get An Amen?
---

Mike Masnick [lays down some excellent comments about the role of patents in high tech overall](http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101496&ref=6324025&pos=1_6324025). I completely agree, so I'm not going to blather on for too long about it. I'll just say I agree with a lot of the principles. Protecting people who contribute innovation and keeping their work from getting ripped off - not a bad ideal. But that is not what the current system is doing, so it no longer deserves the respect it once had.
