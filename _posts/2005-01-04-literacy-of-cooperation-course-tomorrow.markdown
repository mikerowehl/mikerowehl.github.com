title: Literacy of Cooperation Course Tomorrow
---

The [Literacy of Cooperation Course starts tomorrow (Jan 5th) at Stanford](http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2005/01/03/literacy_of_coo.html). The course is [open to the public](http://shl.stanford.edu/hum202.html):




> Non-students who live in the area can show up to the course without signing up.

If you live outside the area we hope to be able to deliver a videostream to you.

We will keep you updated on the feed and how you can let us know that you plan to physically attend the event (check back here weekly). But the simple answer is, you are welcome to attend. 




There's a [group blog](http://cooperation.smartmobs.com/cs/) to go along with the course and a [del.icio.us tag to post links against](http://del.icio.us/tag/cooperation). I'll be over there tomorrow. Taking pictures hopefully and [putting them online](http://mikerowehl.buzznet.com/user/).
