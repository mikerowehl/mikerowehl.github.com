title: A Diet of Monkey Chow
---

This is pure genius! I'm so disappointed I didn't think of it first. A guy trying to [live on a diet of pelletized monkey food](http://www.angryman.ca/monkey.html). FANTASTIC! If it works and he doesn't die I'm definitely doing it. If he does die... I give myself about a 50-50 chance of still trying it. I should start a run of packaging for the new [Futurama style "Bachelor Chow"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_Chow#Bachelor_Chow) product just in case. I'll probably have to wait a while to add flavor however.
