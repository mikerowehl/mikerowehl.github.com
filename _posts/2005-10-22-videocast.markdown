What [Russ says](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008660.html) is definitely true, taking a videocast and putting it up on The Big Screen in the living room is certainly much different than watching it on your desktop or on a device. I knew that though, and I've been a pretty big video fan for a long time. So I just want to give a hat tip to the folks who I've been watching who made it obvious that peer produced video content was going to make a huge difference:







  * [Eric Rice](http://blog.ericrice.com/) - has been blowing this horn for as long as I've known him.


  * [Michael O'Rourke](http://www.dimension7.com/) - comes from a video background to begin with, and has been looking for the growth in peer produced content.


  * [Eli Chapman](http://www.chapmanlogic.com/blog/) - from [Unmediated.org](http://www.unmediated.org/). I ran into Eli a few times when he was out in SF, in particular at our [Mobile Monday on media](http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/02/another-standing-room-only-momo.html) and he told me about a bunch of interesting projects going on with videocasting.


  * [Amanda Congdon](http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/) - Rocketboom was the first recurring themed show that I heard lots of people talking about. It really caught my attention when I was at lunch with a dozen folks, and when someone brought up Rocketboom there were four other people who said "I watch that too".
