I've been wandering around through various IRC channels on [freenode.net](http://www.freenode.net), and while idling in the #scheme channel I saw a message from the lisppaste bot. I had never seen it before, but it's a bot that allows for pasting content to a permenant location and sending a notification to the channel the paste is for. Given the way the bot is setup, it looks like the usage pattern is something like this:




  * during a discussion someone hacks together an example solution


  * directly from their editor/IDE they can send the example to the lisppaste bot, the code is then accessible using HTTP

  * the lisppaste bot informs the channel of the location of the pasted code



I think that makes for a pretty cool blending of web based and chat based collaboration.

Another tool that's new to me is the [meme log](http://meme.b9.com/start). This uses channel logs to thread together conversations and present marked-up forms of the log that make it easier to follow conversations. Apparently the lisppaste bot has a hookup that allows it to link pasted code to the conversation which generated it. I haven't had enough time to fool around with them and see how well they work in practice, but these are some great ideas.
