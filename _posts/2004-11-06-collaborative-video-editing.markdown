Kevin Marks posted a [link to a post about collabrative video editing](http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/10/19/could_we_have_social_video_editing.php) while talking in the [BloggerCon](http://www.bloggercon.org) IRC channel. Follows on pretty well from the [post from the other day](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=351), which speculates about another dimension of public production.
