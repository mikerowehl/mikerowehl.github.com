title: You've Stayed Up Too Late When
---

You know you've acidentally let your bedtime slip too close to sunrise when you're flipping through the onscreen TV guide and MTV actually lists "Music Videos" as currently showing. No need to look at the time, when a thing like that happens you know that either the sun is about to come up or you've somehow ended up in the 80's.  Flock of Seagulls anyone?  Don't laugh, they're [on tour](http://www.oz.net/~davester/AFOS/). On second thought, go ahead and laugh.
