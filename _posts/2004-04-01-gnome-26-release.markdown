title: GNOME 2.6 Release
---

Yesterday the 2.6 version of the [GNOME desktop](http://www.gnome.org/) was released. Most people are going to have to wait until their vendor makes it available, but those looking to live on the bleeding edge can always download it and compile on their own. ArsTechnica has [an overview article](http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/004/software/gnome-2.6/gnome-2.6-1.html) on their site. As mentioned in the article, there are a few tools to help out with downloading and compiling the new version. [CVSGnome](http://www.akcaagac.com/index_cvsgnome.html) actually has info about the 2.6 release on the main page, so I'll probably try that one out. There's also the [GARNOME](http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/) system, but I have no idea how up to date that is.
