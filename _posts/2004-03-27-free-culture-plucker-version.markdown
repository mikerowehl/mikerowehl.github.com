title: Free Culture Plucker version
---

As Lessig [points out in a recent entry](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001809.shtml), there are lots of different formats of his new book [Free Culture](http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/) out there on the Internet now. There's also a [Plucker version out there as well](http://dave.pluckerbooks.com:81/index.php?action=details&id=2098). [Plucker](http://www.plkr.org/) is an open source document reader for Palm handhelds. The book kicks much ass, go read it.
