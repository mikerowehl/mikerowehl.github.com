I set up a [discussion mailing list](http://lists.bitsplitter.net/listinfo.cgi/palmatom-dev-bitsplitter.net) for [PalmAtom](http://www.bitsplitter.net/palmatom/). I'm probably going to hold off pushing out news about a release it until it's actually usable as a normal tool. I've used the sample to post to [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com), but I wouldn't recommend it for most users. Just in case there's some developer interest, I wanted to give them a place to chat.
