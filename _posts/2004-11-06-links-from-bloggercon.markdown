Here are a few interesting links from BloggerCon. [Earnings Cast](http://www.earningscast.com/) casts financials reports in podcast format. [RSS-Powered Personal TV Network](http://grumet.net/ptv/add) is a collection of downloadable video content (fits in well with [Ourmedia stuff](http://www.socialtext.net/ourmedia/index.cgi), which is now open to the public). [PodcastAds](http://www.podcastads.com/) is a way to make money off Podcasting.
