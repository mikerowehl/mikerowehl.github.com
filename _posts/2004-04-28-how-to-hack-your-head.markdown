title: How to Hack Your Head
---

I have to let my geekness shine and provide a pointer to [How to Hack Your Head](http://slate.msn.com/id/2099411/), an article by Steven Johnson. Steven wrote Interface Culture, a book [I just recently read and was quite impressed by](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=174). His latest book, [Mind Wide Open: Your Brian And The Neuroscience of Everyday Life](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743241657/stevenberlinj-20), is currently high on my reading list. The article runs through some existing technologies you can use to get a peek into your brain functioning and mental state. From the sounds of it, direct neural computer interfaces seem to be quite a ways off. Even if you have a few million dollars. Awww man.
