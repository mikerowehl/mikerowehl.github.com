I've been poking around quite a bit lately looking for interesting events in and around Menlo Park (where I live), and I finally found [the Bay Area Linux Events](http://linuxmafia.com/bale/) listing. It's probably something I should have known about as soon as I moved into the area, but I've been living a sheltered life :-)  Rick's [tips for new Linux Users Groups](http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Linux_PR/newlug.html) is an interesting document as well. I've started talking to people over at [SDForum](http://www.sdforum.org) about getting together an Open Source SIG, and some of the tips there look like they might really apply.
