title: Mobile Monday

The [last Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemonday.com/2005/08/momo-august-jam-packed.html) kicked some ass! Thanks to the presenters, fantastic stuff. However I would like to point out that Russ's posts are mistaken.  The topic for October is Mobile Search (NOT September, as he posted).  We haven't decided on a topic for Sept yet, so mail me if you have ideas. I've alredy gotten a few (thanks [John](http://kerncomputing.blogspot.com)!), but don't be bashful if you have something you want to talk about. Email me, or join [the discussion group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mobilemonday/) and propose what you want to talk about.
