The [CodeCon schedule](http://www.codecon.org/2005/schedule.html) was released yesterday. [CodeCon](http://www.codecon.org) is a conference that runs Feb 11th thru 13th 2005 in San Francisco. I'm planning to go. There's a [list of topics also](http://www.codecon.org/2005/program.html), if you just want to see what's going to be talked about. What really caught my eye this time? The [Mappr](http://mappr.com/) talk, Photospace, [Ultra Gleeper](http://www.crummy.com/software/gleeper/), the talk by [2idi](http://www.2idi.com) about i-brokers (I saw [Fen Labalme](http://wiki.idcommons.net/moin.cgi/FenLabalme) speak at a [Future Salon event](http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/01/guard_your_iden.html) and wanted to hear more), and [Kevin's presentation on the Jakarta FeedParser](http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/2005/01/30/FeedParserCometh/).
