There's an interesting event up in San Francisco Thursday night. [Dimension7](http://www.dimension7.com) is hosting a VJ Battle. The event starts at 9:30, and they're going to be using SMS based voting to determine the winner. I wasn't able to go to the last event they did, this one I'm definitely not going to miss. When we set up for Mobile Monday yesterday Grant was playing with a tuntable hooked up to a projector, and he was manipulating the video and audio stream with it. This should be good.
