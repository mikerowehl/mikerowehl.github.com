title: Blogger.com Rolls out Atom API
---

According to [a post in the Blogger Developers Blog](http://new.blogger.com/developers/2004_01_01_archive.pyra#107091563754937970) Blogger now offers the Atom API and feeds. I haven't yet tried them out, but you can bet that I'll be working with them before the end of the day. The announcement includes a link to [AtomEnabled.org](http://www.atomenabled.org/), a site with what looks like lots of great resources related to the Atom API. So with that, I'm off to learn.
