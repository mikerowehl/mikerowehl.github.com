I've thought about systems like [Mosix](http://www.mosix.org/) and their process migration ability with relation to moving about from one system to another. I would love to be able to just take a session from my desktop at work and start it up on my laptop or my desktop at home. I figured it would be great to have something like the [Intel Personal Server](http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5772921353.html) to enable that. But apparently there's another effort called [SoulPad](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2778922637.html) (via [Rootprompt](http://rootprompt.org/article.php3?article=9026)) in the works as well. It's a migration layer for a whole hosted operating system. Nice. I would love to see it based on [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/) instead of VMware, but mostly I just want it.
