title: Multiple Device Software
---

There's an [entry in Tim O'Reilly's blog](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4124) regarding the evolution of software into systems that link together services running on multiple devices. I think would prove particularly beneficial for mobile computing. Personally, I don't care for the sync-to-the-desktop model that devices like Palm handhelds try for. I would much rather see applications that allow for handhelds to serve as smaller access portals to the same applications which are used from desktops. Keeping the PDA in the role of a desktop peripheral kills much of the value I think a portable device can add. However, I do agree that most applications aren't well suited to any other form of use currently. A move in the direction of the kinds of services that Tim describes there would get us a bit closer.
