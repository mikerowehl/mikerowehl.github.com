title: Issues in Open Source Software
---

Thanks to a [post at Future Salon](http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/11/events_this_wee.html) I'm now aware of the [Berkeley Cybersalon this weekend exploring issues in open source](http://www.berkeleycybersalon.com/). Yay! New group. Hopefully I'll be able to make it for the event.  There's other stuff going on that day, so I do have to admit it's not a sure thing. Even if I don't make it this time, at least I know about the Cybersalon now. Here's the event details:







  * Sunday, November 21, 6 - 8 PM


  * The Hillside Club, 2280 Cedar (at Spruce), Berkeley


  * $10 donation at the door for light refreshments
