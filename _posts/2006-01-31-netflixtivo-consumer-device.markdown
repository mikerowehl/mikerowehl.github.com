Although I'm not at all looking, I keep [a copy of my resume up online](http://www.bitsplitter.net/MikeRowehl.txt). Why? Because sometimes a recruiter will call and drop a nice nugget of info to you. That's exactly what happened this morning. I got a call from a recruiter for [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) looking for Linux programmers. There's been [speculation going on for a little while about how Netflix will deliver their on demand download service](http://www.engadget.com/2005/07/27/netflix-close-to-offering-online-movie-downloads/). The recruiter said the project included a team of engineers from ReplayTV, AOL, and Tivo to work on a consumer device. So I looked around on their site, and [here's the job listing](http://jobs.netflix.com/DetailFlix.asp?flix1168). So who knows if it'll see the light of day, but it would appear that the [Tivo/Netflix collaboration that was floating around during 2004](http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118006,00.asp) is still in process.
