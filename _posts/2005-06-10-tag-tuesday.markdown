title: Tag Tuesday

I saw [Tantek's post](http://tantek.com/log/2005/06.html#d10t0159) about [Tag Tuesday](http://www.tagtuesday.com/). Cool stuff! There are a whole bunch of gatherings and get-togethers and parties and roundtables, it just feels like a very exciting time. Unfortunately I can't make it to all of them, but I will be at the Tag Tuesday meeting. Feedster has been doing some [work on tagging](http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/archives/2005/05/future_salon_an_1.html), and although it falls outside of what I've been working on it is an area I'm interested in. Unfortunately [Tony](http://fusion94.org/) won't be in town next week, I'm sure it'll be a great time to meet a big chunk of the people working on the topic.
