The surreal thought for today: [Lawrence Fishburne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne), Morpheus from The Matrix, was [Cowboy Curtis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Curtis) on Pee Wee's Playhouse. I was wondering why Pee Wee ended up in the Adult Swim lineup. I get it now. Joke's over. You can make it stop.
