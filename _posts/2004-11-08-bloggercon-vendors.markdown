[Nick Bradbury](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/11/bloggercon_the_.html) also stopped by the [vendors gathering we had](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=362). I love this comment that he made:






> I was also asked whether I believed my $1000 donation to BloggerCon was money well spent, and I can only say hell yes. If I don't earn an extra $1000 from ideas gained at the conference, then I deserve to be fined.





I ran into the post from Nick via Scott's post [commenting on all the ideas he got during the conference](http://scott.feedster.com/archives/93-BloggerCon,-Vendors,-Nick-and-Me.html). We definitely need to set up a [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com) store with BloggerCon III "I Heart Vendors" shirts.
