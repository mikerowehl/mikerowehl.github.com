At the [AlwaysOn conference](http://www.alwayson-network.com/events/index.php) Tom Byers mentioned the [Stanford Technology Ventures Program Educators Corner](http://edcorner.stanford.edu/index.shtml). The web site has a number of video clips from famous or interesting people in business, talking about the kinds of things they normally talk about at conferences. But you can download them any time and check them out. Nice resource.
