The [September BAMF meeting is this weekend](http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/09/september-bamf-meeting-is-set.html). Details:




  * When: Sat September 25th, 2:00pm


  * Where: Dimension 7 Studios, 150 Folsom Street, San Francisco


  * Who: Anyone interested in mobile and telecom


  * Cost: $10


I'll be there of course. The topic looks pretty interesting -  Ray Rischpater talking about BREW.  I know very little about BREW, this should be a great chance to learn a lot in a very short period. Last time the conversation after the meeting was great, and I'm hoping for the same this time around.

There's a [post meant to collect possible topics for discussion](http://www.mobilityforum.org/2004/09/discussion-topics.html), so if you have something you would like to discuss just add a comment there. I personally had no problem at all with the free mingling at the end of the last meeting, but there were people who did. Maybe they're just the ones who aren't really that into the topic in general, I expected a few people to jump right into that thread and post some comments. I'll kick it off after I'm done with this post.
