title: New MyPalmLife Site
---

The mobile computing site [MyPalmLife](http://mypalmlife.com/index.php) has moved to its new home. Along with the new look, there are user forums as well. There's usually quite a bit of interesting information there, and there are going to be three posters for the blog so that'll probably even increase some. I particularly like that the site isn't just a bunch of Palm fan-boy postings. There's a decent amount of bitching about how lame Palm devices can be and how companies just can't seem to fulfill their promises. Makes me feel like I'm not quite so alone in my pissing and whining.
