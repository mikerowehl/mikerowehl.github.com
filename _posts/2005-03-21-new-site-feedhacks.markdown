I setup a new site, [Feedhacks](http://www.feedhacks.com/blog/) to house a bunch of the projects that it looks like I'll have coming up. I was going to wait a while to put it up, but I got [an RSS inclusion plugin for WordPress](http://www.feedhacks.com/blog/?p=4) working this weekend and wanted to post it. Release early, release often. Right? Hopefully I'll be evolving and adding to the site over the new few weeks, but no promise on that schedule.
