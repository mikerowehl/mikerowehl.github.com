title: Moblogging and Social Networks

There's an [article over at The Feature](http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100252) about a company called Wireless Ink. Wireless Ink is running [a moblogging service](http://winksite.com/site/index.cfm) with hopes of extending it's offering out to social networking apps in general. I like the position, as I'm into the mobile networking issue in general. And it seems like they're really concentrating on the use of the technology, not just the technology itself (an essential element missing from most mobile application offerings).
