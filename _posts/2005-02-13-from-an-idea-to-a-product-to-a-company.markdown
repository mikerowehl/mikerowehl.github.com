title: From an Idea, to a Product, to a Company
---

Jeff Clavier is [speaking at the BMA roundtable](http://softtechvc.blogs.com/software_only/2005/02/from_an_idea_to.html) on Tuesday morning. [Eleanor](http://www.ellementk.com) organizes [the event](http://norcalbma.org/Events/productrndtbl.htm), and I've been to a bunch of them. The discussions tend to be very good. Maybe events that start at 7:30 in the morning attract only those highly dedicated to the cause.
