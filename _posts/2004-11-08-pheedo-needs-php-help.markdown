title: Pheedo Needs PHP Help
---

It's not part of my normal posting fare, but I just wanted to give Bill and Adam some linky love and point out that they're [looking for a PHP programmer](http://www.pheedo.info/archives/000225.html). I got to meet Adam over at [Gnomedex](http://www.gnomedex.com/) and I know Bill from the events he's put on in the Bay Area. Great guys in general, and working towards good things. I would jump on the chance myself if I thought I would have the time to keep up with them.
