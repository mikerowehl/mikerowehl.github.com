title: Nintendo Revolution

Engadget has [a pic of the Nintendo Revolution gaming system](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000790043627/). They say the missing corner makes it look like a secure digital/multimedia card. True. Personally I think it shouts out for the sarcastic tagline: "Nintendo Revolution: We Cut Corners!"
