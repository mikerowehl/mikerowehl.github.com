I'm going over to [BlogOn 2004](http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2004/) at UC Berkeley on July 22nd and 23rd. I wasn't able to go to SuperNova, so I'm really happy that there's another conf I can go to so soon. No info about wireless access, public metablog for trackbacks, or a wiki however. I'll get right on that...
