title: Yep, Earthquake
---

I finally found [the location on the USGS site](http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/latest.htm) that has realtime maps of earthquake activity, so I was able to verify the shaking that I felt. It still hasn't shown up on the list of quakes, but at least the map there told me there was a big quake in central California. And other people in San Francisco said they felt it too. Ah, an [update from the USGS site](http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/neic_crah.html). It's really really official now. I feel validated.
