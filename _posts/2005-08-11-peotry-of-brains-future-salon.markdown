Next Friday (August 19th) there's a Future Salon titled [Poetry of Brains](http://www.futuresalon.org/2005/08/poetry_of_brain.html). [Spencer](http://www.deepdarksee.com/) pinged to say he was going, and it's been too long since I've been to a Future Salon event. And I admit it, I'm a silicon AI fan. Despite the failure of efforts so far to create working models, I just can't read Neuromancer and not think about how cool it would be to have an AI wandering around somewhere scheming against its creators. Or [Ghost in the Shell](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/6304493681/104-4927830-6823146?v=glance)? Come on, admit it. You thought about how to write a polymorphic self-replicating expoit program too.
