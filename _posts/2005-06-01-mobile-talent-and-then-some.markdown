title: Mobile Talent And Then Some
---

Mobility is a really hot topic now in the valley, and people always ask me if I know any good talent they can try to tap for their new product/service/startup. Well folks, [here you go](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2005/06/as_nokia_lifebl.html). Christian Lindholm is looking for the next thing, having successfully brought [Lifeblog](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog/) from concept to standard component in the new NSeries of Nokia phones. Folks simply don't come any more mobile savvy, enthusiastic, and insightful than Christian. I hope someone in the Bay Area can attract his attention, we need people like this.
