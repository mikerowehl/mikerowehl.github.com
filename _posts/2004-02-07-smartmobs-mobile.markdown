Howard Rheingold has been running a great news site [SmartMobs](http://www.smartmobs.com/book/index.html) focusing on a lot of the issues covered in the SmartMobs book. I feel the circle has now been closed. The book was kicked off by mobile usage and pervasive computing, which spawned a site, and has now given rise to [a fully mobile site](http://winksite.com/smartmobs/mobile) that can be accessed using a phone, PDA, or desktop browser. This site is one of the best mobile sites I've seen so far, and makes me want to run off and add a lot more to the [Open Palm Environment](http://winksite.com/Reverend/ope) site. There are brief overviews of the topics in the book, a bunch of surveys, forums,, and a recast of the SmartMobs desktop site blog.
