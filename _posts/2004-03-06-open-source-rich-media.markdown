I was reading [a review of some new music composition software for Linux](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7432) when I found a link to [Planet CCRMA](http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/). Planet CCRMA provides packaged versions of what seems to be a vast collection of audio and video software. I've been interested in electronic music composition for a long time, but I have no music background at all. I've never happened across software that either inherently made sense to me, or which came with the kind of docs I apparently require in order to get clued in. Planet CCRMA provides some nice high level overviews of the applications it provides, which should hopefully help out some. Will it be enough? I have no idea, but hopefully I can take the time to find out. Something that caught my eye after reading through the [list of sound applications](http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/soundapps.html) was the prevalence of Lisp and Lisp based interfaces. Maybe my current stretch into Scheme programming will end up proving useful sooner than I had expected.
