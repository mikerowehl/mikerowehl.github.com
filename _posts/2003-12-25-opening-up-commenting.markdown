title: Opening up Commenting
---

I had commenting turned off by default, but I've decided to turn it on for a while and see what happens. I had it off originally because there seem to be so many problems with blog spam. But there seem to be quite a few people reading now, and I haven't been getting trackback links. So now you readers have the option of commenting directly. Especially those of you who use [Vagablog](http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/), I would like to offer you a way to feedback on the changes and offer suggestions when I throw up mobile computing news articles. So, hopefully this will work out. I look forward to hearing from you, and hopefully this will offer an opportunity for some of you to get to know each other directly.
