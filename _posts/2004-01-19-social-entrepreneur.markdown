title: Social Entrepreneur
---

Joi Ito had a post yesterday that mentioned he thinks of himself as a "Social Entrepreneur", and pointed to [this definition at Stanford Business School](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/csi/SEDefinition.html). I found the commentary to be a pretty interesting overview of entrepreneurship in general. I've just discovered that I'm a huge Schumpeter fan, and now I see the name all over the place. I actually thought this concept of "creative destruction" that Schumpeter describes wasn't very well known, or maybe not well accepted. I hadn't heard it till just a few months ago. But now that I've read about it, and I'm looking for it, it appears all over. I have to get some of his other writings, I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy those as well.
