title: Cyborg? Or Just Funky?
---

Nick showed up today with some funky [running shoes that adjust in the field](http://www.techspot.com/story12866.html). Being a geek I just had to take some pictures.

When you push the buttons on the side you can see the little motors spin on the bottom and adjust the chambers. There's a battery housed over the motor. It has embedded sensors as well apparently, and also adjusts as you run to compensate for changing conditions. It even comes with an instruction manual:

So does that make Nick a cyborg (in the [Steve Mann](http://wearcam.org/index.html) sense) when he goes out running? Depends where you draw the line of course, but it certainly is a step in the right direction. You can take that as a pun or not, your choice.
