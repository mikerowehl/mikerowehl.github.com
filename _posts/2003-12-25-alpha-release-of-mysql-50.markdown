There's an [alpha release of MySQL 5.0](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-5.0.html) available. I haven't tried it out yet, but I use MySQL quite a bit, so I'll hop on this one pretty soon. This new release includes support for stored procedures, which is one of the commonly sighted shortfalls of MySQL according to business users. The companies I work with are normally very heavily pro-MySQL, although some do still use Oracle for special requirements. Hopefully this new release will cover some of those corner cases and allow MySQL to expand into even more areas.
