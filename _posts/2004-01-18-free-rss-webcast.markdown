There was an event close to where I lived about RSS, but I had to miss it. Looks like there's a chance to make it up however, a webcast about RSS called [RSS Winterfest](http://myst-technology.com/mysmartchannels/public/item/17539). I signed up and I'll probably drop in on some of the sessions. I wish they had a little more info about how they're posting the summaries. I probably would have skipped the signup and just read about it, but I think participation is important if someone has put the time into setting up an event like this. So I'm going to put my realtime time into it and listen as it happens. They have some great speakers.
