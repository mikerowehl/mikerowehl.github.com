I'm back in the Bay Area, just taking the train back from the San Jose airport. I had a good trip, and managed to pack in some interesting business activities around the family gatherings. I brought a new book and a few recommended readings back with me. I'll have a plenty of new ideas to spout off about I'm sure. And there are some Vagablog changes which should be on the way as well.
