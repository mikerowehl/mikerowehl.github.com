title: Fred Brooks Speaking in Menlo Park
---

[Fred Brooks](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/) is [speaking in Menlo Park on April 8th, 2004](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1373&mo=4&yr=2004). He wrote [_The Mythical Man-Month_](http://slashdot.org/books/980805/1148235.shtml), one of a very small number of universally applicable software engineering books. The fact that it remains so even decades after it was written is astounding. This is one not to miss.
