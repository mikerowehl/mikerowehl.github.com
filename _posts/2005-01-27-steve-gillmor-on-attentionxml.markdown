title: Steve Gillmor on AttentionXML
---

Steve Gillmor is going to be [speaking at the next eBig Blogging and RSS SIG meeting](http://www.ebig.org/sig/sig.aspx?SIGid=36). The topic is AttentionXML:




> Steve Gillmor, journalist with eWeek, will join us to talk about AttentionXML, a concept he's been instrumental in forming.   AttentionXML is a new technology initiative that will present a richer view than that available through just a static list of rss feeds.  This new standard, still under discussion and development, will help you manage your blogroll, turning it from a list into an interactive, filtered stream of content.




The event is a ways outside of my normal stomping ground, but well worth the trip.
