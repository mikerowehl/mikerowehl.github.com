title: Tag Tuesday Tomorrow
---

I'm planning to head up to the city tomorrow to meet up with some folks in town for [CTIA San Francisco](http://www.wirelessit.com/), and Niall pointed out that [Tag Tuesday](http://www.tagtuesday.com/index.php/2005/09/23/tag-tuesday-september-meeting/) is tomorrow too.  I haven't been out and about all that much lately, so I'm hoping to catch up with a whole bunch of people. If you're gonna be somewhere around Soma tomorrow in the evening give me a ring or send me a message.
