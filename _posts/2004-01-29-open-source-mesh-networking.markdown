title: Open Source Mesh Networking
---

There's an [article over at O'Reilly about mesh networking](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2004/01/22/wirelessmesh.html). It covers the basics of what a mesh is, the kinds of networks which fall into that broad category, and then give instructions about using an existing open source project to form a mesh network using commodity parts and Linux. Very cool!! The article also points to [a wiki about mesh networking](http://wire.less.dk/wiki/index.php/MeshLinks), which has links to lots of other open projects and resources. For a project I was working on I did a decent amount of reading about [using 802.11 networks along with sensor networks](http://www.intel.com/research/exploratory/heterogeneous.htm) to provide a dynamic mesh where just the simple sensors can't do it. This fills in the blanks really well, as a few of these open mesh packages seem like they're quite advanced systems.
