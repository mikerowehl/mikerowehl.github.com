I saw this linked off of [Hack the Planet](http://wmf.editthispage.com/), an online calendaring system called [UW Calendar](http://www.washington.edu/ucal/). It provides for multiple calendars aggregated into a single feed, and is meant to feed data out to all sorts of systems (open source, open standards, yay!!). I need to write a palm application that communicates with this directly, not some sync through a PC hack.
