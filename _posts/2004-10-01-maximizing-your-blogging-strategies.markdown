title: Maximizing Your Blogging Strategies
---

The session actually wandered over a whole bunch of different areas. And it was good. They talked about how to provide more info to users, categorizations, enclosures and what they mean both technically and how it changes user practices, will video or audio blogging really change the medium. Ross popped in at a bunch of point with comments like "Sure, it's hard to do, but it has user benefits. If it's what the users would like, if it would deliver benefit we should be talking about it." I spoke to [Ross](http://blog.blogware.com/blog) for a long time last night. It was excellent to hear from him both last night in person and to have his voice on the panel. Pick up this session and listen to it ([IT Conversations](http://www.itconversations.com)).
