title: PHLAK Site

A friend was downloading the [PHLAK](http://www.phlak.org/modules/news/) ISOs the other day, so I decided to take a look over there today. I haven't downloaded the CD images themselves, but I probably will. I have an HP that just refuses to run Linux in a stable manner. Maybe running most of it off CD will help. And the PHLAK site itself has some great news links. The [Oracle paper on SQL injection attacks](http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/IntegrigyIntrotoSQLInjectionAttacks.pdf) and the [Zaurus tools page](http://homepages.ius.edu/adrian/z/) are both great. This site could be a great general souce of security info if the community keeps going as strong as it seems to be. I'm off to download some ISOs.
