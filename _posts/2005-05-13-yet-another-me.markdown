title: Yet Another Me
---

A project long in the making is starting to get underway. [This is Mobility](http://www.thisismobility.com) is starting to steal some of my attention. Just the time between 2 and 5am so far. I have a bunch of stuff queued already to go in there. Like more info from the [Mobile Enterprise 2005 conf](http://www.tieturi.fi/koulutus/seminaarit/mobileenterprise/home.asp), more info about [Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemonday.net), [Nokia Sensor](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,73651,00.html) hackery and stats, info about the [new phone models from Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,73,00.html), the [W3C Mobile Web Initiative](http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/), and the always popular Rants against The Man. However, I need at least an hour of sleep before I go to attempt to spend all of tomorrow programming again. It'll have to wait till the trainride tomorrow :-) See you at the [Citizens Media party tonight](http://www.darknet.com/2005/05/citizens_media__1.html). Me, and Elle, and a shitload of coffee will be there.
