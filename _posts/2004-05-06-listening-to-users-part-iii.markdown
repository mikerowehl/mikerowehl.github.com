title: Listening to Users Part III
---

TheFeature has [Listening to Users, Part III](http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100591) posted. I really like this series of articles. My personal favorite quote from this one:


> The operators need to let in innovation as the Web has done. If it causes viruses, then that is one of the inevitable consequences of such openness. On the social niceties, all the academic research suggests users can quickly adapt, and users who abused the system would be quickly frozen out.


Yay!! I've said things like that a bunch of times before. It's always nice to find some external validation.
