Chris Pirillo has posted a [blogroll of Gnomedex 4 attendees](http://gnomedex.com/updates/2004-04.php#009917). The list is still pretty short (the conf is still a LONG way off :-) but there are already some interesting blogs on there. I even dropped the [RSS feed version](http://rpc.blogrolling.com/rss.php?r=01a2b5cd7c11e1a5f86e415f7258b15c) into my Bloglines subscriptions so I can check out the blogs of new people as they join. An excellent way to find people with like interests before we get out there. There's supposed to be an open bar the whole time this year. Making a good impression in advance is necessary so as to preemptively counteract the poor impression that stumbling around spewing technoweenie jargon will make.
