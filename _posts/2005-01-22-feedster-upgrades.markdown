title: Feedster Upgrades
---

As is probably abundantly obvious from the [front page at Feedster](http://www.feedster.com/).  We originally expected that the downtime would be Friday afternoon, but there were some snags (I would point you to Scott Johnson's post, but apparently it's on the servers that are currently down, d'oh!). So this is a planned upgrade, not some crash or hack we have to deal with. The rapid growth in the number of new feeds appearing on the Internet, and the effort that [Ray](http://varchars.com/blog/) has made to get all of them to parse and to get more of them added to the index faster, ended up overwhelming the servers. When the site comes back up hopefully it'll be snappier and more robust, thanks in no small part to [the work that Nick Heyman has done since recently joining](http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/?guid=20041221192907) (Nick, you need a blog so that I have something to point to when I talk about you).
