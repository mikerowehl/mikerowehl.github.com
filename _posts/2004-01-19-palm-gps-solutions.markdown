title: Palm GPS Solutions
---

MyPalmLife reports today on a GPS solution from [TomTom](http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=229&c=1), and last week there was news about an option from [Navman](http://mypalmlife.com/index.php?p=225&c=1). Both of them seem to offer Bluetooth based GPS devices, which I would love to get my hands on to try out. Of course, I would be more interested in hooking the information into something like lookups against [GeoURL](http://www.geourl.com/). Both of those navigation options seem to be at least partially focused on being able to provide navigation to "points of interest". I'm sure most of those won't match up well with what I consider interesting. Of course, I won't know if that assumption is true unless I fool around with them for a while. But the Navman at least seems to focus on static maps pulled off an SD card. Hopefully some of the people who pick up these things end up hacking at them a bit. Sounds like the Palm is really gaining potential as a platform for geolocation services.
