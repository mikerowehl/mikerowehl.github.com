title: Vagablog Usage
---

blogNation has [a post about how to use Vagablog with their service](http://blog.blognation.us/blog/_archives/2003/12/13/8913.html), and Jeff Jarvis over at [BuzzMachine](http://www.buzzmachine.com) called it ["my precious Vagablog"](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_03_27.html#006683). Tehehehehe. [Vagablog](http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog) is a Palm based blog posting tool I wrote a while ago. It hasn't made me money, but it's been really cool to see all the places that it pops up.
