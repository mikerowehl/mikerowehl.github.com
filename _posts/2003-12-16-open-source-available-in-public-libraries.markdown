title: Open Source Available in Public Libraries
---

There's [an article at NewsForge](http://www.newsforge.com/software/03/12/14/1545216.shtml?tid=132&tid=151&tid=82) about the effort that Bob Kerr has made to get open source software into public libraries. The article serves as a great example of how the challenges of promoting wider open source adoption can be overcome. Plus I  think the cause itself is fantastic. Bob has apparently been working to get libraries in Scotland to include CDs containing open source software in their collections. With most of the people there still on dialup, downloading large packages like Mozilla or OpenOffice is difficult. He's been trying to get copies of the software made available at the library. Excellent.
