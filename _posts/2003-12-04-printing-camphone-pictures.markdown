There's a [post at picturephoning.com](http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/002479.htm) about the Kodak kiosks in CVS stores offering printing from cell phone images. I'm not sure about market numbers, and I have no clue about the actual implementation of the system, but taken in the abstract I think this sounds like a great idea. Everyone has clearly accepted digital photography, but there is a possible issue with getting good hardcopy. Not everyone has a high quality printer, but sometimes you do want to send a print to grandma for xmas. Nice position.
