title: SENT Art Show

The [SENT exhibit](http://www.sentonline.com/) of phonecam art was supposed to get under way during February of 2004 I thought. At least that's what [an article in The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1117825,00.html) linked from the [press page at SENT](http://www.sentonline.com/press.html) said. There's still a link up at [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/), so I'm assuming the event is still planned to go on. I mailed Xeni to see if I could get some more info. Sounded kooky and interesting, I'm sad to see that interest seems to have petered out.
