Jeff has posted the presentation and some extra info from his Barcamp presentation: [Session on Venture Capital Concepts](http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/08/bar_camp_sessio.html). Fantastic stuff. Jeff is an excellent example of what happens when entrepreneurship and venture work out the way they should. I would tell you to talk to him if you don't already know him, but it seems like he already knows everyone already.
