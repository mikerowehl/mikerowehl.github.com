JD posted about [a grassroots media social gathering](http://www.darknet.com/2005/04/grassroots_medi.html) on Friday May 13th at CNet in San Francisco. There's an [invitation only citizens media strategy session](http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/03/citizens_media_.html) on the Saturday after, and a bunch of the folks attending that session are going to be at the gathering the night before. It's going to be a pretty crazy week for me, but I'm going to try to make it out for Friday. What is citizens/grassroots media? Check out some of the articles from [this search](http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&limit=15&q=%22citizen+media%22+OR+%22grassroots+media%22&sort=date). It's an evolving concept, so it's hard to give a simple static definition. When I think of grassroots media I think of [Jonas Luster](http://www.jluster.org/), [Dan Gillmor](http://dangillmor.typepad.com/), and [JD Lasica](http://jd.typepad.com/). And they do have different takes on what the whole movement means. So drop by on that Friday and find out what all the hubub is about straight from the source, there's sure to be some interesting discussion and arguments.
