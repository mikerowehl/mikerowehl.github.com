title: The Torturous World of Powerpoint
---

I personally like to get more than one viewpoint whenever I can, and I think [The Torturous World of Powerpoint](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2004/06/the_torturous_w.html) provides an excellent complement to the [Art of Positioning and Presenting](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/index.php?p=294) talk that Bill Joos gave at the Art of the Start.
