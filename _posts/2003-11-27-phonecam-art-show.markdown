title: Phonecam Art Show
---

There's an [entry over at picturephoning.com](http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/002411.htm) about [SENT](http://www.sentonline.com/), billed as "americas first phonecam art show". It certainly seems like it could be an interesting project. The site for the project says that all of the images used  in the exhibit will be available online, very cool. Phonecams have really worked their way out into society as a whole very quickly. Material such as that (anything that's worked it's way into the communal unconscious, but especially something that's done it quickly) can provide some really fertile ground for works. The picture phone commercials run by the big cellular providers here in the US do a horrible job of showcasing the potential of these devices. Maybe once the show site opens up we'll have something to point at as an example of a novel application.
