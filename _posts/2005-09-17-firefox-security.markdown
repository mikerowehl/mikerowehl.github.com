Slashdot has a [post pointing to a ZDnet article comparing number of published expoits between Internet Explorer and Firefox](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/16/182232&from=rss). Numbers like this don't really mean anything though. Comparing the number of PUBLISHED expoits found in an open source project to those found in a like proptietary project is like comparing the number of bullseyes you can throw in darts without and with a blindfold on. I would actually expect the Firefox numbers to be an order of magnatude higher than IE, given the amount of time that's been poured into IE so far. Sure, Firefox builds on a common codebase that spans back over a long period, but the number of users that the recent versions have seen is much lower. Over time the Firefox browser will evolve much more quickly, receive much more testing as the userbase grows, and end up much more hardened in the long run. The honeymoon has just started.
