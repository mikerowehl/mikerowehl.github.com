I'm over at [BlogOn](http://www.blogonevent.com) today. There's not much need to upload notes. Heath Row already has transcripts up:





  * [Defining Social Media](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/07/23/defining_social_media.html)


  * [The Dark Side of Social Media](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/07/23/the_dark_side_of_social_media.html)


  * [Business Transparency](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/07/23/business_transparency.html)


  * [The Transformation of Corporate Media](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/07/23/the_transformation_of_corporate_communication.html)






Update: Added two new transcripts.
