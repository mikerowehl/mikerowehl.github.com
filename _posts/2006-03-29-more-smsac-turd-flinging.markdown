title: More SMS.ac Turd Flinging
---

These SMS.ac folks just don't know when to quit. I was chatting with [Russ](http://www.russellbeattie.com) yesterday and this morning, and he was saying that the SMS.ac people are sending him takedown letters for non-libelous content on his blog because he's ranked pretty high in the Google search results. I told him to just take down the stuff cause it's not worth the effort. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I did watch Law and Order this one time and it didn't look too hard. And then I figured, wouldn't it be a real ball buster if a whole bunch of people [linked to Russ's blog with SMS.ac in the link text](http://www.russellbeattie.com), so he's still in the top search results for them even after doing everything they ask.  I think it would be, and I think it's like, totally justified. That's the great thing about scammers and spammers, you can do whatever you want to them and you don't have to feel bad.
