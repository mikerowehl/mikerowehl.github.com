title: Interview with Alan Cox
---

There's [an interview with Alan Cox at ITWales.com](http://www.itwales.com/cgi/showsite/showpage.cgi?998973). He talks about patent law in Europe and open source for businesses. If he ends up doing user interface work instead of kernel work when he goes back to RedHat it could be really interesting. Projects like Gnome and KDE are rolling along, but they no longer have the big splashes that they used to. Maybe because they're somewhat established now, and the things they end up doing just don't seem as exciting as the initial steps did. But Cox participating in the desktop end might have a lot of impact, and reinvigorate whatever area he decides to participate in.
