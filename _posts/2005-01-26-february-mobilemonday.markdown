title: February MobileMonday

I just [posted info about the February 7th 2005 MobileMonday meeting](http://www.mobilemonday.us/2005/01/february-7th-2005-meeting.html). We have a stunning lineup of speakers this time around, I'm really excited about this.

We had a Mobile Hackers meeting a few days ago, but nothing really came of it. Russ asked everyone to bring some running code, but that didn't work out so well. Some people didn't have anything at all, some had demo apps but no code, and the hacking never really got underway. As I mentioned before I've started playing around with [Python on the Series 60](http://www.bitsplitter.net/blog/?p=392), and would like to see if I can get some tools cobbled together that scratch some of my own itches. So if you're interested in hacking on some Python stuff snag me at the meeting and we'll talk.
