MobileCommunityDesign has a [post about the Urban Tapestries project](http://www.mobilecommunitydesign.com/archives/000040.php). The report linked is interesting, they seem to give the honest feedback from what users said. Not too surprizingly many users said they would not use the system on their own yet. This is something that's to be expected with the first few trials of a radically new service however. Not only does the technology look cool, but their techniques such as [bodystorming](http://www.proboscis.org.uk/urbantapestries/bodystorming.html) and their [approach to prototyping and experimentation](http://www.proboscis.org.uk/urbantapestries/prototype.html) are very interesting to read about.
