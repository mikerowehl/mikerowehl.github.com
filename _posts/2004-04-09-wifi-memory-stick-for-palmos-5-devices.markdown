Brighthand has [a review of an 802.11 Memory Stick](http://www.brighthand.com/article/Wi-Fi_Memory_Stick_Review) with drivers for PalmOS 5 devices. That means I should be able to use it with my Clie, very cool. Recently I've been considering getting a new handheld to find out how much use I could get out of WiFi, and this is a nice low cost alternative. It should at least help me figure out from where I can get free or low cost coverage.
