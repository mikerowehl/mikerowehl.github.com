title: Rock On with Your Bad Self

Niall posted a [clip of the Tim Draper music video](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/05/tim_draper_musi.html). I don't think it'll make the charts outside of The Valley, but next time I get tossed out of some VCs office I know I can at least fall back on the Draper video and feel pretty secure in the notion that I'm not the most ridiculous person they've ever spoken to. I might even print a few stills to keep in my pocket for a quick pick me up. Beats a daily affirmation by at least one air guitar and two ass slaps.
