title: Intellectual Property and Open Source
---

[This article](http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1204/p14s02-stct.html) at the Christian Science Monitor provides an excellent summary of the open source movement and potential ramifications with regard to intellectual property rights. I think the article does a great job of calling out the underlying issues, such as:


> Yet if the currency for development is information and ideas in the 21st century, where is the balancing point between the rapid innovation and responsiveness that collaborative projects can trigger and the longstanding legal structure designed to protect intellectual property rights?


They're tough questions, and the article does a great job of laying down how they fit together. Bravo Peter Spotts, great job.
