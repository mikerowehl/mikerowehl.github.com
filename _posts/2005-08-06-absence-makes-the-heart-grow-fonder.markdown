title: Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fonder
---

I haven't been posting very often cause I've been so busy running around working on a bunch of interesting projects. It's not cause I'm tired of blogging or feel like I have nothing to say or any of those kinds of reasons. I've just been completely whomped with stuff to do. I expected to have some time between jobs to do a little catchup, but that hasn't happened. So I'm gonna post a buncha stuff as little snippets, stuff I've had sitting here waiting to go out.
