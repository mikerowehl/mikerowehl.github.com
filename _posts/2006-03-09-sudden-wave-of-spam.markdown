title: Sudden Wave of Spam

Starting yesterday I've seen a big upswing in the number of comments that make it through the [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) plugin. I'm wondering if that's just me, that I made it onto some new list?  Or has someone out there figured out how to beat the filters? The top ones I'm seeing seem to be ephedrine, backgammon, and sex with farm animals. The ephedrine one sounds pretty tempting....




I just [updated to the lastest point version of Wordpress too](http://wordpress.org/download/) in case that helps out.
