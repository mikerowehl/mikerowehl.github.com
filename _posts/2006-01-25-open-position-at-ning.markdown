title: Open Position at Ning
---

We're [looking for a new developer at Ning](http://blog.ning.com/2006/01/were_looking_for_the_newest_me.html).Here's the [complete description](http://jobs.ning.com/group.php?FAQGroup:title=Development#faq-651075). Like Gina says, the team is fantastic. Everyone here knows their shit inside and out, including an ops team that I've just simply never seen the equal to before. The egineers are all fantastic. The project is interesting. The area is great (the offices are in downtown Palo Alto, how much ass does that kick?) It's got the whole shebang.
If you're the kind of person who hops out of bed in the middle of the night sometimes because you think you have a solution to the problem you were working on during the day, we might have a job for you. Drop us a line.
