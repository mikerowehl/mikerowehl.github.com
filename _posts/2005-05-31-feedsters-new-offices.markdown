title: Feedster's New Offices
---

Today is the first day in [the new office](http://www.flickr.com/photos/miker/tags/feedster/)! It's at 116 New Montgomery Street, Suite 605. Nice setup. Plenty of open space, plenty of light. Little bit hot today, but that's supposed to be a temporary issue. And there are tons of places to eat. [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com/) is right here. I've never tried it, but I've heard good things. And [Specialty's](http://www.specialtys.com/) as well, which I have had, and now plan to have over and over again.
