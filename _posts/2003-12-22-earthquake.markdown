I'm sitting here reading news and suddenly my monitor start swaying from side to side. Afraid my cheap cardtable/desk is about to give way I hop up, but feel unsteady on my feet. The blinds are swaying back and forth, and I can see the sliding doors on the closets shifting some. Earthquake? I'm not quite sure. Maybe just some odd settling in my old appartment building. So I think "I'll check online". But then realize I have no idea where to find news quite that immediate. I know it's out there somewhere. But am I seeing nothing in blogs and news sites cause it was a localized event? Or because the sites just haven't been updated yet?
