title: George Bush Jr More Evil Than Cthulhu
---

Wow, folks really hate this [George Bush Jr.](http://lesserevil.ning.com/detail.php?DetailID=425486) guy. You would think he roamed around in the streets killing puppies and kicking children or something. I check out the stats for [all my Ning apps](http://browse.ning.com/any/miker/any/any) on a daily basis. Cause I'm vain, no sense in trying to justify it with anything else. And [LesserEvil](http://lesserevil.ning.com) had a bunch of hits from Google image searches, searches for Georgie there. So I pull up his detail page and what do I see? "Cthulhu is less evil than George Bush Jr. 100% of the time." Wow, that's pretty evil. Or maybe it's just interesting commentary on the mindset of folks in the "online and searching for random stuff cause I have that kind of time on my hands" segment of the population.
