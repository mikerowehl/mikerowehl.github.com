Unfortunately sometimes I have to access sites using a [Cisco VPN](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps2308/index.html). Today I'm at the tail end of setting up my new laptop, so I figured I would go see if there's updates to the VPN software for Linux. I find I need to register in order to download the client software. Annoying, but not crippling. I fill out the form, and another form (which I actually fill out three times before I figure out that I NEED to give them my work address, despite what seems to be a "choice" in their interface), and another form, and then the final form, get the email, click the link, get presented with a login prompt. Then it says "Cisco has determined that Cisco.com password protection has been compromised". Wow, that was quick. I just signed up, what's the deal with that? So I email the account they tell me to, get a random password, login again... same error screen. I'm not that bright, but I recognize an infinite loop when I see one. It's crap like this that gets me up and [evaluating](http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/) [alternatives](http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/). Come on, you don't even have to convince me to use your stuff, unfortunately someone already decided to. All you have to do is not piss me off as I continue to use it, and you keep a customer for your firewall + VPN product. You have switching cost on your side, you're in a position of advantage. Put the damn software up in a public download area, you're not charging for it anyway.
