title: Product Marketing and Management in an Always On World
---

Elle has been leading a product marketing and management roundtable for [BMA](http://norcalbma.org/), and next week they're going to be meeting to discuss [PMM in an Always-On World](http://www.ellementk.com/archives/2005/04/15/326):




> We’ll look past simply tracking what’s said about your company’s products to discuss how we can participate to shape the market and dig into the conversations themselves to gain product and marketing ideas.




The sessions are generally very interesting, so if you have an interest in the topic don't let the timeslot scare you off (it's very early in the morning). Next week is probably going to be extremely busy for me, but I'm planning to be there anyway.
