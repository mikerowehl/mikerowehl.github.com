The Socialtext folks have kicked off an event called [Wiki Wednesdays](http://www.socialtext.net/wikiwed/index.cgi). I haven't made it over to one yet, but the next one in my area is [Sept 7th at Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.net/wikiwed/index.cgi?palo_alto_wednesday_sept_7_2005), which is right around the corner from my office.  I'll have to drop by, I didn't really get a chance to talk to Chris Messina during [BARcamp](http://barcamp.org/), and I missed Eugene Eric Kim completely. And ice cream, you can't realy go wrong with ice cream!
