title: Palm Development Platforms

During a conversation on the [OnBoardC](http://onboardc.sf.net) list, someone posted a link to a [page full of Palm Pilot development platforms](http://www.winikoff.net/palm/dev.html). It seems like a great list, although some of the info is a bit dated. I've been working with OnBoardC some, but have started to try to get more familiar with LispMe so that I can use that instead. There are at least a half dozen implementations on that list that I've never heard of. Guess it's time to do some more evaluation :-)
