There's a post at [TechGnome](http://techgnome.anderson-website.net/index.php?m=20031210#post-124) describing how to setup a Blog This bookmarklet and sidebar for WordPress. The WordPress forum responses seemed to indicate that there was some bookmarklet code included with WordPress already, but I haven't  been able to find it. This version seems to work, but this is the first time that I'm going to try it out for submitting a trackback. [This page is really usefull for adding a sidebar](http://wp.netscape.com/sidebar/preview.html), I've never tried adding one before. It seems like it takes some Javascript in order to do it, and there's no "Add this page as Sidebar" option in my version of Mozilla. Guess it's time to grab a new copy and recompile. For the bookmarklet, you have to grab the example code and put it into a page with the correct URL filled in. Then bring up that page in Mozilla and select "Bookmark this Link" for the Blog This URL.
