[Jon Aquino](http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/) and Matt Webb have been working on some interesting stuff on Ning.  They put together a relatively simple component system that generates dynamic images representing the state of [Ning](http://www.ning.com) apps.  Jon put it together for some of his apps, like [Restaurant Reviews with Maps](http://restaurantreviewswithmaps.ning.com). I stole the stuff and added it to an app I've been working on called [Palo Alto PSP Games](http://paloaltopsp.ning.com). The result: if you setup a profile on PAPSP and add games, you'll find a link on your profile page that takes you to cut and paste code you can drop into your blog template.  And it'll output an image like this linking to your profile and giving the number of games you have in the system:

Very nice!
