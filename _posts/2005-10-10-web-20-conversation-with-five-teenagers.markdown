title: 'Web 2.0: Conversation with Five Teenagers'
---

Jeff Clavier [posted a pointer to](http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/10/web_20_the_teen.html) a [liveblogged session with five teenagers at Web 2.0](http://www.reemer.com/archives/2005/10/08/web_20_conversation_with_five_teenagers/). Definitely worth a read if you're thinking about consumer internet services.
