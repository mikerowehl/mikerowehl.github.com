title: TrailBlazer Web Browser History Visualization
---

Slashdot linked to the [TrailBlazer](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/macwarriors/projects/trailblazer/) project a little while ago. TrailBlazer is a nice visual layout for browser history that should make it easier to get back to a site if you've forgotten to bookmark it. It seems like an excellent idea, but I figured that there would already be a [plugin for Mozilla](http://www.mozdev.org/categories/) to provide some sort of enhanced history features. But there isn't. I'm actually considering dabbling in Mozilla based development... maybe this would be a good place to start hacking.
