title: Test Posting From Vagablog
---

Just trying out [Vagablog](http://www.bitsplitter.net/vagablog/) with my spankin new [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 1.0.2 install. Looks like it still expects the category as a number ... I don't like that. But in general the upgrade was smooth as silk. Go WordPress!!
