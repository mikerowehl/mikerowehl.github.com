title: Emerging Technologies Conf
---

Although I would have loved to attend, I'm not going to be able to make the [Emerging Technologies Conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/), but given that nature of the conf this might not be much of an issue. There's [a wiki](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/hosted.conf?HomePage) to go along with the event, an [ETech page on the Joi Ito wiki](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EtechHookUp), and a [moblog as well](http://etech.textamerica.com/). There are people hanging out in #joiito and #etech on irc.freenode.net who I assume will be filling in info on the sessions as they happen as well. This is an interesting opportunity to see how well these technologies manage to convey the information from the conference in realtime. It looks like I might be able to get some great info from the conf right as it happens even though I can't make it down there.
